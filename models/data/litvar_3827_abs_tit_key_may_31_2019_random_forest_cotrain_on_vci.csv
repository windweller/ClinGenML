Significant Improvement in Detecting BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR Mutations Using Next-Generation Sequencing as Compared with FDA-Cleared Kits. || DNA Mutational Analysis ErbB Receptors Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Neoplasms Paraffin Embedding Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Reagent Kits, Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity United States United States Food and Drug Administration || We compared mutations detected in EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF genes using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing with mutations that could be detected by FDA-cleared testing kits. Paraffin-embedded tissue from 822 patients was tested for mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF by NGS. Sanger sequencing of hot spots was used with locked nucleic acid to increase sensitivity for specific hot-spot mutations. This included 442 (54%) lung cancers, 168 (20%) colorectal cancers, 29 (4%) brain tumors, 33 (4%) melanomas, 14 (2%) thyroid cancers, and 16% others (pancreas, head and neck, and cancer of unknown origin). Results were compared with the approved list of detectable mutations in FDA kits for EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF. Of the 101 patients with EGFR abnormalities as detected by NGS, only 58 (57%) were detectable by cobas v2 and only 35 (35%) by therascreen. Therefore, 42 and 65%, respectively, more mutations were detected by NGS, including two patients with EGFR amplification. Of the 117 patients with BRAF mutation detected by NGS, 62 (53%) mutations were within codon 600, detectable by commercial kits, but 55 (47%) of the mutations were outside codon V600, detected by NGS only. Of the 321 patients with mutations in KRAS detected by NGS, 284 (88.5%) had mutations detectable by therascreen and 300 (93.5%) had mutations detectable by cobas. Therefore, 11.5 and 6.5% additional KRAS mutations were detected by NGS, respectively. NGS provides significantly more comprehensive testing for mutations as compared with FDA-cleared kits currently available commercially.	4
Zinc Metallochaperones as Mutant p53 Reactivators: A New Paradigm in Cancer Therapeutics. ||  || Restoration of wild-type structure and function to mutant p53 with a small molecule (hereafter referred to as "reactivating" mutant p53) is one of the holy grails in cancer therapeutics. The majority of TP53 mutations are missense which generate a defective protein that is targetable. We are currently developing a new class of mutant p53 reactivators called zinc metallochaperones (ZMCs) and, here, we review our current understanding of them. The p53 protein requires the binding of a single zinc ion, coordinated by four amino acids in the DNA binding domain, for proper structure and function. Loss of the wild-type structure by impairing zinc binding is a common mechanism of inactivating p53. ZMCs reactivate mutant p53 using a novel two-part mechanism that involves restoring the wild-type structure by reestablishing zinc binding and activating p53 through post-translational modifications induced by cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The former causes a wild-type conformation change, the later induces a p53-mediated apoptotic program to kill the cancer cell. ZMCs are small molecule metal ion chelators that bind zinc and other divalent metal ions strong enough to remove zinc from serum albumin, but weak enough to donate it to mutant p53. Recently we have extended our understanding of the mechanism of ZMCs to the role of cells' response to this zinc surge. We found that cellular zinc homeostatic mechanisms, which normally function to maintain free intracellular zinc levels in the picomolar range, are induced by ZMCs. By normalizing zinc levels, they function as an OFF switch to ZMCs because zinc levels are no longer sufficiently high to maintain a wild-type structure. This on/off switch leads to a transient nature to the mechanism of ZMCs in which mutant p53 activity comes on in a few hours and then is turned off. This finding has important implications for the translation of ZMCs to the clinic because it indicates that ZMC concentrations need not be maintained at high levels for their activity. Indeed, we found that short exposures (as little as 15 min) were adequate to observe the mutant p53 reactivating activity. This switch mechanism imparts an advantage over other targeted therapeutics in that efficacy can be accomplished with minimal exposure which minimizes toxicity and maximizes the therapeutic window. This on/off switch mechanism is unique in targeted cancer therapeutics and will impact the design of human clinical trials.	0
Resolving the genetic heterogeneity of prelingual hearing loss within one family: Performance comparison and application of two targeted next generation sequencing approaches. || Adolescent Adult Cadherins Family Health Female Genetic Heterogeneity Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Pedigree RNA, Ribosomal Reproducibility of Results Sulfate Transporters Young Adult || Here, we report an unconventional Chinese pedigree consisting of three branches all segregating prelingual hearing loss (HL) with unclear inheritance pattern. After identifying the cause of one branch as maternally inherited aminoglycoside-induced HL, targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) was applied to identify the genetic causes for the other two branches. One affected subject from each branch was subject to targeted NGS whose genomic DNA was enriched either by whole-exome capture (Agilent SureSelect All Exon 50 Mb) or by candidate genes capture (Agilent SureSelect custom kit). By NGS analysis, we identified that patients from Branch A were compound heterozygous for p.E1006K and p.D1663V in the CDH23 (DFNB12) gene; and patients from Branch B were homozygous for IVS7-2A>G in the SLC26A4 (DFNB4) gene. Both CDH23 mutations altered conserved calcium binding sites of the extracellular cadherin domains. The co-occurrence of three different genetic causes in this family was exceedingly rare but fully compatible with the mutation spectrum of HL. Our study has also raised several technical and analytical issues when applying the NGS technique to genetic testing.	4
The effect of genetic variation in PCSK9 on the LDL-cholesterol response to statin therapy. || Adult African Americans Aged Biomarkers Cholesterol, LDL Dyslipidemias European Continental Ancestry Group Female Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Genotype Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Male Middle Aged Pharmacogenetics Pharmacogenomic Variants Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proprotein Convertase 9 Risk Factors Treatment Outcome || Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and prevent cardiovascular disease. However, there is wide individual variation in LDL-C response. Drugs targeting proprotein convertase subtilin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) lower LDL-C and will be used with statins. PCSK9 mediates the degradation of LDL receptors (LDLRs). Therefore, a greater LDL-C response to statins would be expected in individuals with PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) variants because LDLR degradation is reduced. To examine this hypothesis, the effect of 11 PCSK9 functional variants on statin response was determined in 669 African Americans. One LOF variant, rs11591147 (p.R46L) was significantly associated with LDL-C response to statin (P=0.002). In the three carriers, there was a 55.6% greater LDL-C reduction compared with non-carriers. Another functional variant, rs28362261 (p.N425S), was marginally associated with statin response (P=0.0064).The effect of rs11591147 was present in individuals of European ancestry (N=2388, P=0.054). The therapeutic effect of statins may be modified by genetic variation in PCSK9.	4
Defective interactions of protein partner with ion channels and transporters as alternative mechanisms of membrane channelopathies. || Animals Biological Transport Channelopathies Humans Ion Channels Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs || The past twenty years have revealed the existence of numerous ion channel mutations resulting in human pathology. Ion channels provide the basis of diverse cellular functions, ranging from hormone secretion, excitation-contraction coupling, cell signaling, immune response, and trans-epithelial transport. Therefore, the regulation of biophysical properties of channels is vital in human physiology. Only within the last decade has the role of non-ion channel components come to light in regard to ion channel spatial, temporal, and biophysical regulation in physiology. A growing number of auxiliary components have been determined to play elemental roles in excitable cell physiology, with dysfunction resulting in disorders and related manifestations. This review focuses on the broad implications of such dysfunction, focusing on disease-causing mutations that alter interactions between ion channels and auxiliary ion channel components in a diverse set of human excitable cell disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Reciprocal influences between cell cytoskeleton and membrane channels, receptors and transporters. Guest Editor: Jean Claude Hervé	0
Detection of Allelic Variants of the POLE andPOLD1 Genes in Colorectal Cancer Patients. ||  || Incidence of colorectal cancer is high worldwide and it mostly occurs as an accumulation of environmental factors and genetic alterations. Hereditary colorectal cancer can develop as a part of a hereditary syndrome. There is a suspected correlation between colorectal cancer and allelic variants of the POLE andPOLD1 genes. The aim of the present study was to look for associations between the allelic variants in thePOLE andPOLD1 genes and colorectal cancer. One thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine DNA samples from colorectal cancer patients were collected from 2002 to 2013. Samples were divided in three groups: hereditary colorectal cancer patients, patients with different hereditary cancer syndromes in their families and patients with no cancer history in their families. The DNA samples were screened for allelic variants ofPOLE rs483352909 andPOLD1 rs39751463 using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). All patients were negative for allelic variants rs483352909 of thePOLE gene and rs397514632 of thePOLD1 gene. One allelic variant rs373243003 in thePOLE gene and one novel duplication of four nucleotides at the excision site between intron and exon (c.1384-5dupCCTA) in thePOLD1 gene, was found. We could not detect or confirm the connection between the genetic variants in thePOLD1 andPOLE genes and colorectal cancer patients, but we detected a novel genetic variant with an unknown significance.	4
Abnormal mannose-6-phosphate receptor trafficking impairs recombinant alpha-glucosidase uptake in Pompe disease fibroblasts. ||  || Pompe disease (PD) is a metabolic myopathy caused by alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency and characterized by generalized glycogen storage. Heterogeneous GAA gene mutations result in wide phenotypic variability, ranging from the severe classic infantile presentation to the milder intermediate and late-onset forms. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA), the only treatment available for PD, intriguingly shows variable efficacy in different PD patients. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the variable response to ERT, we studied cell morphology of PD fibroblasts, the distribution and trafficking of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) that mediates rhGAA uptake, and rhGAA uptake itself. We observed abnormalities of cell morphology in PD cells. Electron microscopy analysis showed accumulation of multivesicular bodies and expansion of the Golgi apparatus, and immunolocalization and western blot analysis of LC3 showed activation of autophagy. Immunofluorescence analysis showed abnormal intracellular distribution of CI-MPR in PD fibroblasts, increased co-localization with LC3 and reduced availability of the receptor at the plasma membrane. The recycling of CI-MPR from the plasma membrane to the trans-Golgi network was also impaired. All these abnormalities were more prominent in severe and intermediate PD fibroblasts, correlating with disease severity. In severe and intermediate PD cells rhGAA uptake and processing were less efficient and correction of GAA activity was reduced. These results indicate a role for disrupted CI-MPR trafficking in the variable response to ERT in PD and have implications for ERT efficacy and optimization of treatment protocols.	1
Mutation screening of PALB2 in clinically ascertained families from the Breast Cancer Family Registry. || Adult Aged Amino Acid Substitution Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Early Detection of Cancer Exons Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Grading Nuclear Proteins Pedigree Registries Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Loss-of-function mutations in PALB2 are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, with recent data showing that female breast cancer risks for PALB2 mutation carriers are comparable in magnitude to those for BRCA2 mutation carriers. This study applied targeted massively parallel sequencing to characterize the mutation spectrum of PALB2 in probands attending breast cancer genetics clinics in the USA. The coding regions and proximal intron-exon junctions of PALB2 were screened in probands not known to carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BCRA2 from 1,250 families enrolled through familial cancer clinics by the Breast Cancer Family Registry. Mutation screening was performed using Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based targeted massively parallel sequencing platform. Screening of PALB2 was successful in 1,240/1,250 probands and identified nine women with protein-truncating mutations (three nonsense mutations and five frameshift mutations). Four of the 33 missense variants were predicted to be deleterious to protein function by in silico analysis using two different programs. Analysis of tumors from carriers of truncating mutations revealed that the majority were high histological grade, invasive ductal carcinomas. Young onset was apparent in most families, with 19 breast cancers under 50 years of age, including eight under the age of 40 years. Our data demonstrate the utility of Hi-Plex in the context of high-throughput testing for rare genetic mutations and provide additional timely information about the nature and prevalence of PALB2 mutations, to enhance risk assessment and risk management of women at high risk of cancer attending clinical genetic services.	4
[After the LDL receptor and apolipoprotein B, autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia reveals its third protagonist: PCSK9]. || Animals Apolipoproteins B Humans Hypercholesterolemia Receptors, LDL Subtilisins Transcription Factors || The genes encoding the low-density lipoproteins receptor and its ligand apolipoprotein B, have been the only two genes classically implicated in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. We have identified in 2003, the third gene implicated in this disease: PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilin Kexin 9). Several mutations (p.S127R, p.F216L, p.D374Y...) of this gene have been reported to cause hypercholesterolemia by a gain of function leading to a reduction of LDL receptor levels. Other variations of PCSK9 are conversely associated with hypocholesterolemia particularly the non-sense p.Y142X and p.C679X mutations found in 2% of black Americans and associated with a decrease of LDL levels and coronary heart diseases. PCSK9 substrates and exact role have not been elucidated yet, but it seems that PCSK9 is definitely a major actor in cholesterol homeostasis. PCSK9 inhibitors might constitute new therapeutic targets that would decrease plasma LDL cholesterol levels and be synergistic with statin drugs.	4
Shoc2 is targeted to late endosomes and required for Erk1/2 activation in EGF-stimulated cells. || Animals Base Sequence COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops Clathrin Heavy Chains Endosomes Epidermal Growth Factor ErbB Receptors HeLa Cells Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins MAP Kinase Signaling System Mutant Proteins RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering Recombinant Fusion Proteins ras Proteins || Shoc2 is the putative scaffold protein that interacts with RAS and RAF, and positively regulates signaling to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). To elucidate the mechanism by which Shoc2 regulates ERK1/2 activation by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), we studied subcellular localization of Shoc2. Upon EGFR activation, endogenous Shoc2 and red fluorescent protein tagged Shoc2 were translocated from the cytosol to a subset of late endosomes containing Rab7. The endosomal recruitment of Shoc2 was blocked by overexpression of a GDP-bound H-RAS (N17S) mutant and RNAi knockdown of clathrin, suggesting the requirement of RAS activity and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. RNAi depletion of Shoc2 strongly inhibited activation of ERK1/2 by low, physiological EGF concentrations, which was rescued by expression of wild-type recombinant Shoc2. In contrast, the Shoc2 (S2G) mutant, that is myristoylated and found in patients with the Noonan-like syndrome, did not rescue ERK1/2 activation in Shoc2-depleted cells. Shoc2 (S2G) was not located in late endosomes but was present on the plasma membrane and early endosomes. These data suggest that targeting of Shoc2 to late endosomes may facilitate EGFR-induced ERK activation under physiological conditions of cell stimulation by EGF, and therefore, may be involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of signaling through the RAS-RAF module.	0
SMARCA4 germline gene mutation in a patient with epithelial ovarian: A case report. ||  || SMARCA4 is gene whose protein product participates in chromatin remodeling. Somatic mutations in this gene are associated with non-small cell lung cancer and malignant rhabdoid tumors, and both germline and somatic mutations are seen with small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type. To date, there are no data identifying an association with more common epithelial carcinomas of the ovary. The patient is a 57-year-old female without any significant family history of cancer, diagnosed with high-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary. Per guideline, she underwent genetic testing, and was found to have a deleterious germline SMARCA4 mutation. She was treated with standard chemotherapy and an optimal tumor reduction, with a complete response to treatment. The etiology of this patient's high-grade serous carcinoma is unknown. If the SMARCA4 gene plays a role in serous ovarian carcinoma it is with variable expressivity. Further investigation into the role ofSMARCA4 as a susceptibility gene for epithelial ovarian cancer is warranted.	4
Skin globotriaosylceramide 3 deposits are specific to Fabry disease with classical mutations and associated with small fibre neuropathy. || Adolescent Adult Fabry Disease Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Small Fiber Neuropathy Trihexosylceramides Young Adult || Fabry Disease (FD) is characterized by globotriaosylceramide-3 (Gb3) accumulation in several tissues and a small fibre neuropathy (SFN), however the underlying mechanisms are poorly known. This study aimed to: 1) ascertain the presence of Gb3 deposits in skin samples, by an immunofluorescence method collected from FD patients with classical GLA mutations or late-onset FD variants or GLA polymorphisms; 2) correlate skin GB3 deposits with skin innervation. we studied 52 genetically-defined FD patients (32 with classical GLA mutations and 20 with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms), 15 patients with SFN associated with a specific cause and 22 healthy controls. Subjects underwent skin biopsy to evaluate Gb3 deposits and epi-dermal innervation. Skin Gb3 deposits were found in all FD patients with classical GLA mutations but never in FD patients with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms or in patients with SFN and healthy controls. Abnormal deposits were found inside different skin structures but never inside axons. FD patients with GB3 deposits showed lower skin innervation than FD patients with late-onset variants or polymorphisms. 1) Skin Gb3 deposits are specific to FD patients with classical GLA mutations; 2) Gb3 deposits were associated with lower skin innervation but they were not found inside axons, suggesting an indirect damage on peripheral small fibre innervation.	4
The transfer of multigene panel testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer to healthcare: What are the implications for the management of patients and families? || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Cohort Studies Evidence-Based Practice Female France Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Physician-Patient Relations Practice Guidelines as Topic Practice Patterns, Physicians' Professional-Family Relations Transcriptome Translational Medical Research || Until recently, the molecular diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) was mostly based on BRCA1/2 testing. Next generation sequencing and the recent discovery of new genes involved in HBOC now permit the transfer of genomic capture targeting multiple candidate genes from research to clinical use. However, the implications for the management of patients and their families have not been extensively studied, in particular since some of these genes are not well-established cancer predisposing genes. We studied 583 consecutive patients from Burgundy (France) fulfilling the criteria for BRCA testing using a next generation sequencing 25-genes panel including 20 well-established high-risk cancer genes as well as more recently identified predisposing HBOC cancer. A pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutation was found in 51 patients (9%). Besides, we found 37 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in 10 different high to low-risk genes in 34 patients (6%). The most frequently mutated genes were CHEK2 (n = 12; 2%), ATM (n = 9; 1.5%), and PALB2 (n = 4; 0.6%). Three patients had a mutation in two different predisposing genes. The analysis of clinical actionability conducted in mutation-positive individuals revealed that additional disease-specific screening and/or prevention measures beyond those based on personal and family history alone had been recommended in 69% of cases. In conclusion, multigene panel testing is a powerful tool to identifying high to low-risk HBOC susceptibility genes. The penetrance and spectrum of cancers with these other genes are sometimes undefined, and further collaborative work is crucial to address this question.	4
Myosin individualized: single nucleotide polymorphisms in energy transduction. || Amino Acid Substitution Binding Sites Genomics Humans Models, Molecular Monte Carlo Method Mutation, Missense Myosin Heavy Chains Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Isoforms Protein Structure, Tertiary || Myosin performs ATP free energy transduction into mechanical work in the motor domain of the myosin heavy chain (MHC). Energy transduction is the definitive systemic feature of the myosin motor performed by coordinating in a time ordered sequence: ATP hydrolysis at the active site, actin affinity modulation at the actin binding site, and the lever-arm rotation of the power stroke. These functions are carried out by several conserved sub-domains within the motor domain. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect the MHC sequence of many isoforms expressed in striated muscle, smooth muscle, and non-muscle tissue. The purpose of this work is to provide a rationale for using SNPs as a functional genomics tool to investigate structurefunction relationships in myosin. In particular, to discover SNP distribution over the conserved sub-domains and surmise what it implies about sub-domain stability and criticality in the energy transduction mechanism. An automated routine identifying human nonsynonymous SNP amino acid missense substitutions for any MHC gene mined the NCBI SNP data base. The routine tested 22 MHC genes coding muscle and non-muscle isoforms and identified 89 missense mutation positions in the motor domain with 10 already implicated in heart disease and another 8 lacking sequence homology with a skeletal MHC isoform for which a crystallographic model is available. The remaining 71 SNP substitutions were found to be distributed over MHC with 22 falling outside identified functional sub-domains and 49 in or very near to myosin sub-domains assigned specific crucial functions in energy transduction. The latter includes the active site, the actin binding site, the rigid lever-arm, and regions facilitating their communication. Most MHC isoforms contained SNPs somewhere in the motor domain. Several functional-crucial sub-domains are infiltrated by a large number of SNP substitution sites suggesting these domains are engineered by evolution to be too-robust to be disturbed by otherwise intrusive sequence changes. Two functional sub-domains are SNP-free or relatively SNP-deficient but contain many disease implicated mutants. These sub-domains are apparently highly sensitive to any missense substitution suggesting they have failed to evolve a robust sequence paradigm for performing their function.	0
HNF1A mutation presenting with fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood prior to onset of overt diabetes. || Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Amino Acid Substitution Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Female Fetal Macrosomia Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Heterozygote Humans Hypoglycemia Infant, Newborn Male Mutation, Missense Pedigree Pregnancy Young Adult || HNF1A-MODY (MODY3) is a common subtype of autosomal dominant diabetes. Unlike HNF4-MODY where fetal macrosomia and early postnatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have been reported, a history of transient insulin overproduction has not been recognized in individuals with HNF1A-MODY yet. Here, we report a 40-year-old male patient with HNFJA mutation p.Arg272His (c.815G>A) with a history of fetal macrosomia (4750 g, 59 cm) and, at least, one attack of symptomatic hypoglycemia in childhood. Diabetes was subsequently diagnosed at 19 years. The proband's daughter who developed diabetes at 16 years carries the same mutation, but her birth weight and length were in the upper normal range, and she never experienced hypoglycemic symptoms. The observation of fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood is suggestive of a biphasic impact of the HNF1A mutation on beta-cell function over the lifespan, leading from inappropriate insulin oversecretion to final clinical diabetes.	4
Postzygotic HRAS and KRAS mutations cause nevus sebaceous and Schimmelpenning syndrome. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Male Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mosaicism Mutation Nevus Nevus, Sebaceous of Jadassohn Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction Young Adult ras Proteins || Nevus sebaceous is a common congenital cutaneous malformation. Affected individuals may develop benign and malignant secondary tumors in the nevi during life. Schimmelpenning syndrome is characterized by the association of nevus sebaceous with extracutaneous abnormalities. We report that of 65 sebaceous nevi studied, 62 (95%) had mutations in the HRAS gene and 3 (5%) had mutations in the KRAS gene. The HRAS c.37G>C mutation, which results in a p.Gly13Arg substitution, was present in 91% of lesions. Nonlesional tissues from 18 individuals had a wild-type sequence, confirming genetic mosaicism. The HRAS c.37G>C mutation was also found in 8 of 8 associated secondary tumors. Mosaicism for HRAS c.37G>C and KRAS c.35G>A mutations was found in two individuals with Schimmelpenning syndrome. Functional analysis of HRAS c.37G>C mutant cells showed constitutive activation of the MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Our results indicate that nevus sebaceous and Schimmelpenning syndrome are caused by postzygotic HRAS and KRAS mutations. These mutations may predispose individuals to the development of secondary tumors in nevus sebaceous.	4
Comparison of responses of human melanoma cell lines to MEK and BRAF inhibitors. ||  || The NRAS and BRAF genes are frequently mutated in melanoma, suggesting that the NRAS-BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is an important target for therapy. Two classes of drugs, one targeting activated BRAF and one targeting MEK, are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. We have analysed the NRAS and BRAF mutational status of a series of 44 early passage lines developed from New Zealand patients with metastatic melanoma. 41% of the lines analysed had BRAF mutations, 23% had NRAS mutations, and 36% had neither. We then determined IC50 values (drug concentrations for 50% growth inhibition) for CI-1040, a commonly used inhibitor of MEK kinase; trametinib, a clinical agent targeting MEK kinase; and vemurafenib, an inhibitor of mutant BRAF kinase. Cell lines with activating BRAF mutations were significantly more sensitive to vemurafenib than lines with NRAS mutations or lines lacking either mutation (p < 0.001). IC50 values for CI-1040 and trametinib were strongly correlated (r = 0.98) with trametinib showing ~100-fold greater potency. Cell lines sensitive to vemurafenib were also sensitive to CI-1040 and trametinib, but there was no relationship between IC50 values and NRAS mutation status. A small number of lines lacking a BRAF mutation were sensitive to CI-1040 but resistant to vemurafenib. We used western blotting to investigate the effect on ERK phosphorylation of CI-1040 in four lines, of vemurafenib in two lines and of trametinib in two lines. The results support the view that MEK inhibitors might be combined with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of melanomas with activated BRAF. The high sensitivity to trametinib of some lines with wildtype BRAF status also suggests that MEK inhibitors could have a therapeutic effect against some melanomas as single agents.	0
Clinical evaluation of panel testing by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for gene mutations in myeloid neoplasms. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Algorithms Biomarkers, Tumor Computational Biology DNA Mutational Analysis Databases, Genetic Exons Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Male Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Prognosis Tandem Repeat Sequences Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 || Genomic techniques in recent years have allowed the identification of many mutated genes important in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Together with cytogenetic aberrations, these gene mutations are powerful prognostic markers in AML and can be used to guide patient management, for example selection of optimal post-remission therapy. The mutated genes also hold promise as therapeutic targets themselves. We evaluated the applicability of a gene panel for the detection of AML mutations in a diagnostic molecular pathology laboratory. Fifty patient samples comprising 46 AML and 4 other myeloid neoplasms were accrued for the study. They consisted of 19 males and 31 females at a median age of 60 years (range: 18-88 years). A total of 54 genes (full coding exons of 15 genes and exonic hotspots of 39 genes) were targeted by 568 amplicons that ranged from 225 to 275 bp. The combined coverage was 141 kb in sequence length. Amplicon libraries were prepared by TruSight myeloid sequencing panel (Illumina, CA) and paired-end sequencing runs were performed on a MiSeq (Illumina) genome sequencer. Sequences obtained were analyzed by in-house bioinformatics pipeline, namely BWA-MEM, Samtools, GATK, Pindel, Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor and a novel algorithm ITDseek. The mean count of sequencing reads obtained per sample was 3.81 million and the mean sequencing depth was over 3000X. Seventy-seven mutations in 24 genes were detected in 37 of 50 samples (74 %). On average, 2 mutations (range 1-5) were detected per positive sample. TP53 gene mutations were found in 3 out of 4 patients with complex and unfavorable cytogenetics. Comparing NGS results with that of conventional molecular testing showed a concordance rate of 95.5 %. After further resolution and application of a novel bioinformatics algorithm ITDseek to aid the detection of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), the concordance rate was revised to 98.2 %. Gene panel testing by NGS approach was applicable for sensitive and accurate detection of actionable AML gene mutations in the clinical laboratory to individualize patient management. A novel algorithm ITDseek was presented that improved the detection of FLT3-ITD of varying length, position and at low allelic burden.	4
Kinetic partitioning during folding of the p53 DNA binding domain. || Binding Sites DNA-Binding Proteins Kinetics Mutation, Missense Protein Denaturation Protein Folding Spectrometry, Fluorescence Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Urea || The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of wild-type p53 loses DNA binding activity spontaneously at 37 degrees C in vitro, despite being thermodynamically stable at this temperature. We test the hypothesis that this property is due to kinetic misfolding of DBD. Interrupted folding experiments and chevron analysis show that native molecules are formed via four tracks (a-d) under strongly native conditions. Folding half-lives of tracks a-d are 7.8 seconds, 50 seconds, 5.3 minutes and more than five hours, respectively, in 0.3M urea (10 degrees C). Approximately equal fractions of molecules fold through each track in zero denaturant, but above 2.0M urea approximately 90% fold via track c. A kinetic mechanism consisting of two parallel folding channels (fast and slow) is proposed. Each channel populates an on-pathway intermediate that can misfold to form an aggregation-prone, dead-end species. Track a represents direct folding through the fast channel. Track b proceeds through the fast channel but via the off-pathway state. Track c corresponds to folding via the slow channel, primarily through the off-pathway state. Track d proceeds by way of an even slower, uncharacterized route. We postulate that activity loss is caused by partitioning to the slower tracks, and that structural unfolding limits this process. In support of this view, tumorigenic hot-spot mutants G245S, R249S and R282Q accelerate unfolding rates but have no affect on folding kinetics. We suggest that these and other destabilizing mutants facilitate loss of p53 function by causing DBD to cycle unusually rapidly between folded and unfolded states. A significant fraction of DBD molecules become effectively trapped in a non-functional state with each unfolding-folding cycle.	0
Systemic lupus erythematosus in a patient with Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair 1: More than a chance association. ||  || Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been reported among patients with RASopathy. Five patients have been reported: three with SHOC2 variants, one with a PTPN11 variant, and one with a KRAS variant. SHOC2 variant might represent a relatively common predisposing factor for SLE among the RASopathy genes. However, the clinical details were only reported for two patients, while information on the remaining patient appeared only in a tabular format with minimal clinical description. Here, we report a patient with a SHOC2 variant and SLE. The proband was a 28-year-old male patient with intellectual disabilities, a short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and thin hair. He developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and afebrile generalized seizures at the ages of 7 and 18 years, respectively. At the age of 24 years, he presented with a 3-day history of intermittent fever accompanied by right chest pain and a malar butterfly rash. He fulfilled both the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria for SLE and was successfully treated with prednisolone. Medical exome sequencing identified a de novo SHOC2 variant (c.4A > G, p.S2G). The present report of a second patient who fulfills both the ACR criteria and the SLICC criteria of SLE. We suggest that the association between SHOC2 variant and SLE represents more than a chance association. In the event of fever of unknown origin in patients with constitutional SHOC2 pathogenic variant, SLE should be suspected.	4
A novel p53 rescue compound induces p53-dependent growth arrest and sensitises glioma cells to Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Aza Compounds Brain Neoplasms Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Cells, Cultured Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glioma Humans Mutation Promoter Regions, Genetic Quinazolines RNA Interference RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering Rats Rats, Sprague-Dawley Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation Valine || Reactivation of mutant p53 in tumours is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Here we characterise the novel p53 rescue compound P53R3 that restores sequence-specific DNA binding of the endogenously expressed p53(R175H) and p53(R273H) mutants in gel-shift assays. Overexpression of the paradigmatic p53 mutants p53(R175H), p53(R248W) and p53(R273H) in the p53 null glioma cell line LN-308 reveals that P53R3 induces p53-dependent antiproliferative effects with much higher specificity and over a wider range of concentrations than the previously described p53 rescue drug p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis (PRIMA-1). Furthermore, P53R3 enhances recruitment of endogenous p53 to several target promoters in glioma cells bearing mutant (T98G) and wild-type (LNT-229) p53 and induces mRNA expression of numerous p53 target genes in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, P53R3 strongly enhances the mRNA, total protein and cell surface expression of the death receptor death receptor 5 (DR5) whereas CD95 and TNF receptor 1 levels are unaffected. Accordingly, P53R3 does not sensitise for CD95 ligand- or tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced cell death, but displays synergy with Apo2L.0 in 9 of 12 glioma cell lines. Both DR5 surface induction and synergy with Apo2L.0 are sensitive to siRNA-mediated downregulation of p53. Thus this new p53 rescue compound may open up novel perspectives for the treatment of cancers currently considered resistant to the therapeutic induction of apoptosis.	0
Thermal stability of glucokinase (GK) as influenced by the substrate glucose, an allosteric glucokinase activator drug (GKA) and the osmolytes glycerol and urea. || Adenosine Triphosphate Allosteric Regulation Apoenzymes Enzyme Activators Enzyme Stability Escherichia coli Glucokinase Glucose Glycerol Humans Kinetics Models, Molecular Mutation Osmotic Pressure Protein Conformation Protein Folding Recombinant Fusion Proteins Temperature Thermodynamics Urea Water || We investigated how glycerol, urea, glucose and a GKA influence kinetics and stability of wild-type and mutant GK. Glycerol and glucose stabilized GK additively. Glycerol barely affected the TF spectra of all GKs but decreased k(cat), glucose S(0.5) and K(D) values and ATP K(M) while leaving cooperativity unchanged. Glycerol sensitized all GKs to GKA as shown by TF. Glucose increased TF of GKs without influence of glycerol on the effect. Glycerol and GKA affected kinetics and binding additively. The activation energies for thermal denaturation of GK were a function of glucose with K(D)s of 3 and 1mM without and with glycerol, respectively. High urea denatured wild type GK reversibly at 20 and 60°C and urea treatment of irreversibly heat denatured GK allowed refolding as demonstrated by TF including glucose response. We concluded: Glycerol stabilizes GK indirectly without changing the folding structure of the apoenzyme, by restructuring the surface water of the protein, whereas glucose stabilizes GK directly by binding to its substrate site and inducing a compact conformation. Glucose or glycerol (alone or combined) is unable to prevent irreversible heat denaturation above 40°C. However, urea denatures GK reversibly even at 60°C by binding to the protein backbone and directly interacting with hydrophobic side chains. It prevents irreversible aggregation allowing complete refolding when urea is removed. This study establishes the foundation for exploring numerous instability mutants among the more than 600 variant GKs causing diabetes in animals and humans.	0
A bidirectional system for the dynamic small molecule control of intracellular fusion proteins. || Binding Sites Crystallography, X-Ray Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drosophila Proteins HEK293 Cells Humans Models, Molecular Mutation Protein Stability Recombinant Fusion Proteins Small Molecule Libraries Temperature Ubiquitination || Small molecule control of intracellular protein levels allows temporal and dose-dependent regulation of protein function. Recently, we developed a method to degrade proteins fused to a mutant dehalogenase (HaloTag2) using small molecule hydrophobic tags (HyTs). Here, we introduce a complementary method to stabilize the same HaloTag2 fusion proteins, resulting in a unified system allowing bidirectional control of cellular protein levels in a temporal and dose-dependent manner. From a small molecule screen, we identified N-(3,5-dichloro-2-ethoxybenzyl)-2H-tetrazol-5-amine as a nanomolar HALoTag2 Stabilizer (HALTS1) that reduces the Hsp70:HaloTag2 interaction, thereby preventing HaloTag2 ubiquitination. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the HyT/HALTS system in probing the physiological role of therapeutic targets by modulating HaloTag2-fused oncogenic H-Ras, which resulted in either the cessation (HyT) or acceleration (HALTS) of cellular transformation. In sum, we present a general platform to study protein function, whereby any protein of interest fused to HaloTag2 can be either degraded 10-fold or stabilized 5-fold using two corresponding compounds.	0
Oncogenic Intra-p53 Family Member Interactions in Human Cancers. ||  || The p53 gene family members p53, p73, and p63 display several isoforms derived from the presence of internal promoters and alternative splicing events. They are structural homologs but hold peculiar functional properties. p53, p73, and p63 are tumor suppressor genes that promote differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis. p53, unlike p73 and p63, is frequently mutated in cancer often displaying oncogenic "gain of function" activities correlated with the induction of proliferation, invasion, chemoresistance, and genomic instability in cancer cells. These oncogenic functions are promoted either by the aberrant transcriptional cooperation of mutant p53 (mutp53) with transcription cofactors (e.g., NF-Y, E2F1, Vitamin D Receptor, Ets-1, NF-kB and YAP) or by the interaction with the p53 family members, p73 and p63, determining their functional inactivation. The instauration of these aberrant transcriptional networks leads to increased cell growth, low activation of DNA damage response pathways (DNA damage response and DNA double-strand breaks response), enhanced invasion, and high chemoresistance to different conventional chemotherapeutic treatments. Several studies have clearly shown that different cancers harboring mutant p53 proteins exhibit a poor prognosis when compared to those carrying wild-type p53 (wt-p53) protein. The interference of mutantp53/p73 and/or mutantp53/p63 interactions, thereby restoring p53, p73, and p63 tumor suppression functions, could be among the potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of mutant p53 human cancers.	0
PCSK9 as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease. ||  || It is well recognized that the elevated plasma level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Deposition of pro-atherogenic LDL-C, on the intima of arterial wall, contributes to plaque formation and atherosclerosis, which further leads to lowered blood flow to vital organs and increased risk of CVD. The most commonly used statin therapy is effective in reducing dyslipidemia and preventing cardiovascular events only in about half of the patient population. However, in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, these drugs were not effective to meet the required goals of lower LDL-C, and to reduce the CVD risk. Furthermore, many patients even develop intolerability to statins and resistance. The identification of pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and the association of PCSK9 mutations with familial hypercholesterolemia led to the identification of PCSK9 as a new therapeutic target for lowering LDL-C and dyslipidemia-associated CVD. PCSK9 is found to promote the degradation of LDL-receptor (LDLR), thus rendering it unavailable for recycling to hepatocyte plasma membrane, leading to elevated levels of circulating LDL-C, as it cannot be taken up into cells. While gain-of-function mutations aggravate the degradation of LDLR as in familial hypercholesterolemia whereas loss of function mutations reduce the ability of PCSK9 to promote the degradation of LDLR and thus lower the plasma level of LDL-C and dyslipidemia. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are currently being tested in clinical trials and are found to be efficacious in countering the activity of PCSK9 and thus control the plasma LDL-C and triglycerides even in statin non-responsive patients and protect against dyslipidemia-related CVD.	4
Mutation profiling in chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and its correlation with clinicopathological features and anti-EGFR treatment response. || Adenocarcinoma Adult Aged Antineoplastic Agents Asian Continental Ancestry Group Camptothecin Cetuximab Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis ErbB Receptors Female Fluorouracil Humans Irinotecan Male Middle Aged Organoplatinum Compounds Oxaliplatin Retrospective Studies || An increasing number of studies reveal the significance of genetic markers in guiding target treatment and refining prognosis. This retrospective observational study aims to assess the mutation profile of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Chinese population with the help of MassARRAY® technique platform and OncoCarta™ Panel.322 Chinese patients with mCRC who received clinical molecular testing as part of their standard care were investigated. 80 patients received cetuximab palliative treatment. 238 common hot-spot mutations of 19 cancer related genes in the OncoCarta™ Panel were tested.44 mutations in 11 genes were detected in 156 cases (48.4%). At least one mutation was identified in 38.5% (124/322) of all tested cases, two concomitant mutations in 9.0% (29/322) and three mutations in 3 cases (<1%). KRAS was the most frequently mutated gene (34.8%), followed by PIK3CA (9.6%), NRAS (4.3%), BRAF (3.4%), EGFR (2.5%) and HRAS (1.2%). Less frequent mutations were detected in PDGFRA, RET, AKT1, FGFR1, and ERBB2. Co-mutation of RAS family subtypes was observed in 5 patients, and KRAS and BRAF concurrent mutation in 1 patient. KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations had association with some clinicopathological features statistically. Patients identified as wild-type in all 19 genes had better objective response rate when treated with cetuximab.The clinical molecular testing with OncoCarta™ Panel supplemented the limited data of mCRC in Chinese population, and offered a clearer landscape of multiple gene mutational profile in not only clinically prognostic KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes, but also less frequent mutated genes. Knowledge of these multiple gene mutation patterns may give clues in exploring interesting accompanying co-occurrence relationship or mutually exclusive relationship between mutated genes, as well as in predicting benefit of all-wild-type patients from anti-EGFR treatment.	4
Mutation Status and Immunohistochemical Correlation of KRAS, NRAS, andBRAF in 260 Chinese Colorectal and Gastric Cancers. ||  || KRAS, NRAS andBRAF are kinases involved in the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway and also potential tumor-driven genes. Patients withKRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations are resistant to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the mutation status and distribution ofKRAS/NRAS/BRAF in Chinese colorectal and gastric cancers, and to explore the histopathological changes and related immunohistochemical marker changes caused by these mutations. The mutation status ofKRAS (exons 2, codon 12/13),NRAS (exons 2/3/4, codon 12/13/59/61/117/146) andBRAF (exons 15, codon 600) were detected by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) in 86 colon cancer, 140 rectal cancer and 34 gastric cancer tissues. Then, the frequencies and distribution ofKRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations were described in detail. Furthermore, the relationship betweenKRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations and the features of histopathological and related immunohistochemical markers were analyzed. The results showed thatKRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutation rates in colon cancer were 44.2, 1.2, and 3.5%; in rectal cancer were 37.1, 4.3, and 0.7%; in gastric cancer were none, none and 2.9%. The mutation rate ofKRAS in female (48.8%) is significantly higher than that of male (27.8%), and the mutation rate increased with the higher degree of differentiation. Additionally, the mutation rate ofBRAF detected by ARMS-PCR (1.77%) was significantly lower than that by immunohistochemistry (4.11%). It also showed that theKRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutation status had a certain relationship with the expression of some immunohistochemical markers. This study provides more data support for clinical research onKRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutation in CRCs or gastric cancers.	4
Simultaneous multi‑gene mutation screening using SNPscan in patients from ethnic minorities with nonsyndromic hearing‑impairment in Northwest China. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool China Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Deafness Female Genotype Humans Male Membrane Transport Proteins Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide RNA, Ribosomal Sulfate Transporters Young Adult || The present study aimed to investigate the molecular etiology of nonsyndromic hearing impairment (HI) in hearing impaired populations of Hui, Tibetan, and Tu ethnicities in northwest China. A total of 283 unrelated subjects with HI who attended special education schools in northwest China were enrolled in the present study. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three common deafness‑related genes, gap junction protein β2 (GJB2), solute carrier family 26 member 4 (SLC26A4) and mitochondrially encoded 12S RNA (mtDNA12SrRNA), were detected using a SNPscan technique. GJB2 mutations were detected in 14.89% of Hui patients, 9.37% of Tibetan patients and 11.83% of Tu patients. The most prevalent GJB2 mutation in the Hui and Tu patients was c.235delC. In the Tibetan patients, the c.109G>A SNP exhibited the highest allele frequency. SLC26A4 mutations were detected in 10.64% of Hui patients, 6.25% of Tibetan patients, and 8.6% of Tu patients. The most common SLC26A4 mutation was c.919‑2A>Gin the Hui, Tibetan, and Tu patients, and the second most common SLC26A4 mutations in these patients were c.1517T>G, c.1226G>A andc.2168A>G, respectively. The mutation rates ofmtDNA12SrRNA in the Hui, Tibetan, and Tu patients were 1.06, 5.21, and 5.38%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the mutation spectra of these deafness‑related genes are unique amongst these three ethnic groups. This information will be helpful in designing a protocol for genetic testing for deafness and for achieving accurate molecular diagnoses in northwest China.	4
[Mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in phenylketonuria patients from Shaanxi]. ||  || To investigate the feature of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations and provide guidance for genetic and prenatal diagnosis of patients with phenylketonuria from Shaanxi. For 55 patients whose blood Phe concentration was over 2.0 mg/dL, potential mutations in 13 exons and flanking sequences of the PAH gene were detected by PCR and DNA sequencing. A total of 98 mutations were detected in 110 PAH alleles, with the detection rate being 89.10%. Nine mutations have been identified in exon 7, which accounted for 33.67% of all. Exon 12 (14.29%) and exon 3 (12.24%) have followed. Thirty eight mutations, locating in exon2-exon12 and the flanking sequence, were detected in the 55 PKU patients. p.R243Q (24.49%) was the commonest mutation, whilstp.A47E, p.I65S and p.A259T were first discovered in China. After querying international databases including PAHdb and HGMD, the p.C334X was verified as the novel PAH gene mutation. The mutation spectrum of the PAH gene in Shaanxi has been identified. And a novel mutation has been identified. This may facilitate the diagnosis of PKU in the future.	3
TP53/MicroRNA Interplay in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. || Carcinoma, Hepatocellular DNA Methylation Humans Liver Neoplasms MicroRNAs Molecular Targeted Therapy Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The role of microRNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes has emerged in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pivotal tumor suppressive role of p53-axis is indicated by the presence of inactivating mutations in TP53 gene in nearly all cancers. A close interaction between these two players, as well as the establishment of complex p53/miRNAs loops demonstrated the strong contribution of p53-effector miRNAs in enhancing the p53-mediated tumor suppression program. On the other hand, the direct and indirect targeting of p53, as well as the regulation of its stability and activity by specific microRNAs, underlie the importance of the fine-tuning of p53 pathway, affecting the cell fate of damaged/transformed cells. The promising results of miRNAs-based therapeutic approaches in preclinical studies and their entrance in clinical trials demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in several diseases, including cancer. Molecularly targeted drugs approved so far for HCC treatment show intrinsic or acquired resistances with disease progression in many cases, therefore the identification of effective and non-toxic agents for the treatment of HCC is actually an unmet clinical need. The knowledge of p53/miRNA inter-relations in HCC may provide useful elements for the identification of novel combined approaches in the context of the "personalized-medicine" era.	0
Would raising the total cholesterol diagnostic cut-off from 7.5 mmol/L to 9.3 mmol/L improve detection rate of patients with monogenic familial hypercholesterolaemia? || Adult Cardiology Cholesterol Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Female Heterozygote High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Mass Screening Middle Aged Mutation Receptors, LDL Triglycerides || A previous report suggested that 88% of individuals in the general population with total cholesterol (TC) > 9.3 mmol/L have familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). We tested this hypothesis in a cohort of 4896 UK civil servants, mean (SD) age 44 (±6) years, using next generation sequencing to achieve a comprehensive genetic diagnosis. 25 (0.5%) participants (mean age 49.2 years) had baseline TC > 9.3 mmol/L, and overall we found an FH-causing mutation in the LDLR gene in seven (28%) subjects. The detection rate increased to 39% by excluding eight participants with triglyceride levels over 2.3 mmol/L, and reached 75% in those with TC > 10.4 mmol/L. By extrapolation, the detection rate would be ∼25% by including all participants with TC > 8.6 mmol/L (2.5 standard deviations from the mean). Based on the 1/500 FH frequency, 30% of all FH-cases in this cohort would be missed using the 9.3 mmol/L cut-off. Given that an overall detection rate of 25% is considered economically acceptable, these data suggest that a diagnostic TC cut-off of 8.6 mmol/L, rather than 9.3 mmol/L would be clinically useful for FH in the general population.	4
Characterization of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in phenylketonuria in Xinjiang of China. ||  || To investigate the spectrum and frequency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Xinjiang, China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in combination with single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing analyses were performed, to screen potential mutations in the PAH gene in 46 individual PKU patients. Direct DNA sequencing was used to analyze the all of the exons in the PAH gene, including the promoter and flanking intron regions, in another 15 PKU patients. Our results indicated that, 30 different mutation types were identified in all 122 PAH alleles, with the mutation detection rate of 78.7% (96/122). Four novel mutations, i.e., 5'-Flanking -626G>A, 5'-Flanking -480DelACT, S196fsX4, and IVS8+1G>C, were identified for the first time. Similar to other regions in North China, R243Q, EX6-96A>G, IVS4-1A>G, R111X, and Y356X were the most prevalent PAH mutations in PKU patients from Xinjiang. Additionally, common mutations showed different frequencies in Xinjiang, when compared to other areas. Furthermore, sixteen different PAH gene mutation types were identified for the first time in the minorities in Xinjiang. Distinctive mutation spectrum of PAH gene in PKU patients from Xinjiang were characterized, which may promote the construction of PAH gene mutation database and serve as valuable tools for genetic diagnosis and counseling, and prognostic evaluation for PKU cases in the local area.	3
Phenotype analysis of an Australian DFNA9 family with the 1109N COCH mutation. || Adult Audiometry, Pure-Tone Audiometry, Speech Auditory Threshold Australia Cross-Sectional Studies DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Extracellular Matrix Proteins Family Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Prevalence Proteins Retrospective Studies || We studied the clinical characteristics of an Australian family with an autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing impairment (DFNA9) caused by an I109N mutation in COCH. Retrospective analyses of audiometric data from 8 mutation carriers of an Australian DFNA9 family with the I109N COCH mutation were performed. Cross-sectional hearing levels related to age, age-related typical audiograms, and speech recognition scores related to age and to the level of hearing impairment were investigated. Data were compared to those obtained in previously identified DFNA9 families with P51S, V66G, G87W, G88E, I109T, and C542F COCH mutations. Deterioration of hearing in the I109N mutation carriers started before the age of 40 years. The audiometric characteristics of the I109N mutation carriers are essentially similar to those previously established in I109T mutation carriers and, to a lesser extent, in P51S, G87W, and G88E mutation carriers. The phenotype associated with the I109N COCH mutation is largely similar to that associated with the I109T, P51S, G87W, and G88E mutation carriers. However, subtle differences seem to exist in terms of age of onset and rate of progression.	4
Mutant p53 gain-of-function induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition through modulation of the miR-130b-ZEB1 axis. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Blotting, Western Disease Progression Endometrial Neoplasms Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Homeodomain Proteins Humans MicroRNAs Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Signal Transduction Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1 || The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis by regulating microRNA (miRNA) expression. Here, we report that mutant p53 exerts oncogenic functions and promotes EMT in endometrial cancer (EC) by directly binding to the promoter of miR-130b (a negative regulator of ZEB1) and inhibiting its transcription. We transduced p53 mutants into p53-null EC cells, profiled the miRNA expression by miRNA microarray and identified miR-130b as a potential target of mutant p53. Ectopic expression of p53 mutants repressed the expression of miR-130b and triggered ZEB1-dependent EMT and cancer cell invasion. Loss of an endogenous p53 mutation increased the expression of miR-130b, which resulted in reduced ZEB1 expression and attenuation of the EMT phenotype. Furthermore, re-expression of miR-130b suppressed mutant p53-induced EMT and ZEB1 expression. Importantly, the expression of miR-130 was significantly reduced in EC tissues, and patients with higher expression levels of miR-130b survived longer. These data provide a novel understanding of the roles of p53 gain-of-function mutations in accelerating tumor progression and metastasis through modulation of the miR-130b-ZEB1 axis.	0
Prevalence of GJB2 Mutations in Affected Individuals from United Arab Emirates with Autosomal Recessive Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss. || Adult Alleles Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genotype Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Prevalence United Arab Emirates || Mutations in the gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) gene are responsible for more cases of nonsyndromic recessive hearing loss than any other gene. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of GJB2 mutations among affected individuals from United Arab Emirates (UAE). There were 50 individuals diagnosed with hereditary hearing loss and 120 healthy individuals enrolled in the study. The Sanger sequencing method was used to screen the GJB2 coding region in all affected individuals. The c.-1G>A variant was determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in normal individuals. Nine cases with bi-allelic mutations and three cases with mono-allelic mutations were detected in 12 out of 50 patients (24%). The homozygous mutation c.35delG was identified as the cause of hearing loss in six participants (12%). The mutation c.506G>A was identified in three affected individuals (6%). The allelic frequency (14%) and low percentage of individuals that were homozygous (2%) for the c.35delG mutation suggest that there are other genes responsible for nonsyndromic deafness in the UAE population. The results reported here are a preliminary step in collecting epidemiological data regarding autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss related to GJB2 gene mutations among the UAE population. The c.35delG mutation of the GJB2 gene is the most frequently seen causative mutation in the UAE and is followed by the p.Cys169Tyr mutation.	4
Noonan syndrome due to a SHOC2 mutation presenting with fetal distress and fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a premature infant. || Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Fatal Outcome Fetal Distress Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature Infant, Premature, Diseases Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Male Mutation Noonan Syndrome || We report on a patient with Noonan syndrome due to SHOC2 missense mutation predicting p.Ser2Gly, recently described in association with Noonan syndrome. The male infant presented with fetal distress requiring premature delivery at 32 weeks and was noted to have dysmorphic features, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and respiratory distress following birth. An echocardiogram revealed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The infant's cardiac lesion rapidly progressed, and he was discharged home for palliative care. Clinical testing of genes causative of Noonan syndrome and related disorders detected the previously reported, pathogenic, de novo SHOC2 missense mutation predicting p.Ser2Gly. The patient's cardiac findings and features were not typical for those individuals previously reported with this SHOC2 mutation and thus expand the clinical phenotype.	4
Mutant p53 Protein and the Hippo Transducers YAP and TAZ: A Critical Oncogenic Node in Human Cancers. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Animals Carcinogenesis Humans Mice Neoplasms Oncogenes Phosphoproteins Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 protein is a well-known tumor suppressor factor that regulates cellular homeostasis. As it has several and key functions exerted, p53 is known as "the guardian of the genome" and either loss of function or gain of function mutations in the TP53 coding protein sequence are involved in cancer onset and progression. The Hippo pathway is a key regulator of developmental and regenerative physiological processes but if deregulated can induce cell transformation and cancer progression. The p53 and Hippo pathways exert a plethora of fine-tuned functions that can apparently be in contrast with each other. In this review, we propose that the p53 status can affect the Hippo pathway function by switching its outputs from tumor suppressor to oncogenic activities. In detail, we discuss: (a) the oncogenic role of the protein complex mutant p53/YAP; (b) TAZ oncogenic activation mediated by mutant p53;	0
Different TP53 mutations are associated with specific chromosomal rearrangements, telomere length changes, and remodeling of the nuclear architecture of telomeres. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus Cell Proliferation Chromosomal Instability Colonic Neoplasms Humans Mutation Telomere Telomere-Binding Proteins Transcriptome Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53 mutations are the most common mutations in human cancers, and TP53-R175H and TP53-R273H are the most frequent. The impact of these mutations on genomic instability after tumor initiation is still uncovered. To gain insight into this, we studied the effects of three specific TP53 mutants (TP53-V143A, TP53-R175H, and TP53-R273H) on genomic instability using four isogenic lines of LoVo cells. Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), three-dimensional (3D) quantitative FISH (Q-FISH) on interphase and Q-FISH on metaphases were used to investigate genomic instability. We found that LoVo cells expressing mutant TP53-R175H displayed the highest level of chromosomal instability among the LoVo cell lines. Furthermore, we observed that mutant TP53-R175H and TP53-V143A showed more alterations in their 3D nuclear architecture of telomeres than the mutant TP53-R273H and the wild type. Moreover, we noted an association between some chromosomal abnormalities and telomere elongation in the mutant TP53-R175H. Taken together, our results indicate that the mutation TP53-R175H is more likely to cause higher levels of genomic instability than the other TP53 mutations. We proposed that the type of TP53 mutations and the genetic background of a cancer cell are major determinants of the TP53-dependent genomic instability.	0
[Diagnostic methods and clinic application for mtDNA A1555G and GJB2 and SLC26A4 genes in deaf patients]. ||  || To establish the method of clinic genetic testing for common deaf genes such as mtDNA nt1555, GJB2 gene and SLC26A4 (Pendrin's syndrome gene, PDS) gene. Three hundred and sixty seven sporadic patients with hearing loss from out-patient department of General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, 60 patients with history of maternal inherited hearing loss from 27 family, 20 congenital deaf patients from special educational school for deaf and dumb, 3 deaf patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) confirmed by CT scan, 50 control individuals with normal bone conductive hearing were analyzed. The genetic testing kit for mtDNA A1555G mutation was used to detect mtDNA A1555G mutation. The whole gene sequencing were accomplished in 20 congenital deaf patients. In 3 patients with EVA, fragments covering all exons of PDS gene were analyzed by denatured high productive liquid chromatogram and special exons were sequenced when DHPLC showed abnormal wave patterns of amplicons covering these exons. Fifty nine patients from 26 family and 5 sporadic patients were found to carry mtDNA A1555G mutation. Among 20 congenital deaf patients, 2 cases were found to have homozygous GJB2 235 del C mutation, 1 case had compound 235del C and 299-300 del AT mutation. Other 2 cases carried heterozygous 109 A-G mutation. Among 3 patients with EVA, 1 case was found to have heterozygous PDS G316X mutation and other 2 cases had homozygous 919-2 A-G mutation. CONCLUSIONS Genetic testing for deafness is feasible procedure with remarkable clinic significance.	4
Activating cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CYSLTR2) mutations in blue nevi. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11 High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Nevus, Blue Phospholipase C beta Receptors, Leukotriene Skin Neoplasms Young Adult || Blue nevi are common melanocytic tumors arising in the dermal layer of the skin. Similar to uveal melanomas, blue nevi frequently harbor GNAQ and GNA11 mutations. Recently, recurrent CYSLTR2 and PLCB4 mutations were identified in uveal melanomas not harboring GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. All four genes (GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, and PLCB4) code for proteins involved in the same signaling pathway, which is activated by mutations in these genes. Given the related functional consequences of these mutations and the known genetic similarities between uveal melanoma and blue nevi, we analyzed a cohort of blue nevi to investigate whether CYSLTR2 and PLCB4 mutations occur in tumors lacking GNAQ or GNA11 mutations (as in uveal melanoma). A targeted next-generation sequencing assay covering known activating mutations in GNAQ, GNA11, CYSLTR2, PLCB4, KIT, NRAS, and BRAF was applied to 103 blue nevi. As previously reported, most blue nevi were found to harbor activating mutations in GNAQ (59%, n=61), followed by less frequent mutations in GNA11 (16%, n=17). Additionally, one BRAF (1%) and three NRAS (3%) mutations were detected. In three tumors (3%) harboring none of the aforementioned gene alterations, CYSLTR2 mutations were identified. All three CYSLTR2 mutations were the same c.386T>A, L129Q mutation previously identified in uveal melanoma that has been shown to lead to increased receptor activation and signaling. In summary, our study identifies CYSLTR2 L129Q alterations as a previously unrecognized activating mutation in blue nevi, occuring in a mutually exclusive fashion with known GNAQ and GNA11 mutations. Similar to GNAQ and GNA11 mutations, CYSLTR2 mutations, when present, are likely defining pathogenetic events in blue nevi.	4
Clinical Heterogeneity in two patients with Noonan-like Syndrome associated with the same SHOC2 mutation. || Biomarkers Body Height Child Cognition Disorders Diagnosis, Differential Female Growth Disorders Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Loose Anagen Hair Syndrome Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Syndrome || Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH; OMIM #607721) has been recently related to the invariant c.4A > G missense change in SHOC2. It is characterized by features reminiscent of Noonan syndrome. Ectodermal involvement, short stature associated to growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD), and cognitive deficits are common features. We compare in two patients with molecularly confirmed NS/LAH diagnosis, the clinical phenotype and pathogenetic mechanism underlying short stature. In particular, while both the patients exhibited a severe short stature, GH/IGFI axis functional evaluation revealed a different pathogenetic alteration, suggesting in one patient an upstream alteration (typical GHD) and in the other one a peripheral GH insensitivity.	4
Tylosis with oesophageal cancer: Diagnosis, management and molecular mechanisms. || Diagnosis, Differential Disease Management Esophageal Neoplasms Humans Keratoderma, Palmoplantar, Diffuse || Tylosis (hyperkeratosis palmaris et plantaris) is characterised by focal thickening of the skin of the hands and feet and is associated with a very high lifetime risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus. This risk has been calculated to be 95% at the age of 65 in one large family, however the frequency of the disorder in the general population is not known and is likely to be less than one in 1,000,000. Oesophageal lesions appear as small (2-5 mm), white, polyploid lesions dotted throughout the oesophagus and oral leukokeratosis has also been described. Although symptoms of oesophageal cancer can include dysphagia, odynophagia, anorexia and weight loss, there may be an absence of symptoms in early disease, highlighting the importance of endoscopic surveillance in these patients. Oesophageal cancer associated with tylosis usually presents in middle to late life (from mid-fifties onwards) and shows no earlier development than the sporadic form of the disease. Tylosis with oesophageal cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance of the cutaneous features, usually by 7 to 8 years of age but can present as late as puberty. Mutations in RHBDF2 located on 17q25.1 have recently been found to be causative. A diagnosis of tylosis with oesophageal cancer is made on the basis of a positive family history, characteristic clinical features, including cutaneous and oesophageal lesions, and genetic analysis for mutations in RHBDF2. The key management goal is surveillance for early detection and treatment of oesophageal dysplasia. Surveillance includes annual gastroscopy with biopsy of any suspicious lesion together with quadratic biopsies from the upper, middle and lower oesophagus. This is coupled with dietary and lifestyle modification advice and symptom education. Symptomatic management of the palmoplantar keratoderma includes regular application of emollients, specialist footwear and early treatment of fissures and super-added infection, particularly tinea pedis. More specific treatment for the thick skin is available in the form of oral retinoids, which are very effective but commonly produce side effects, including nasal excoriation and bleeding, hypercholesterolaemia, and abnormal liver function tests. Genetic counselling can be offered to patients and family members once a family history has been established. The prognosis of tylosis with oesophageal cancer is difficult to determine due to the limited number of affected individuals. In the last 40 years of surveillance, five out of six cases of squamous oesophageal cancer in the Liverpool family were detected endoscopically and were surgically removed. Four of five patients had stage 1 disease at presentation and remain alive and well more than 8 years later. This suggests that the presence of a screening program improves prognosis for these patients.	4
A beta-camera integrated with a microfluidic chip for radioassays based on real-time imaging of glycolysis in small cell populations. || Beta Particles Biological Transport Calibration Cell Line, Tumor Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 Glucose Glycolysis Humans Indoles Microfluidic Analytical Techniques Molecular Imaging Radiometry Single-Cell Analysis Sulfonamides Systems Integration Time Factors Vemurafenib || An integrated β-camera and microfluidic chip was developed that is capable of quantitative imaging of glycolysis radioassays using (18)F-FDG in small cell populations down to a single cell. This paper demonstrates that the integrated system enables digital control and quantitative measurements of glycolysis in B-Raf(V600E)-mutated melanoma cell lines in response to specific B-Raf inhibition. The β-camera uses a position-sensitive avalanche photodiode to detect charged particle-emitting probes within a microfluidic chip. The integrated β-camera and microfluidic chip system was calibrated, and the linearity was measured using 4 different melanoma cell lines (M257, M202, M233, and M229). Microfluidic radioassays were performed with cell populations ranging from hundreds of cells down to a single cell. The M229 cell line has a homozygous B-Raf(V600E) mutation and is highly sensitive to a B-Raf inhibitor, PLX4032. A microfluidic radioassay was performed over the course of 3 days to assess the cytotoxicity of PLX4032 on cellular (18)F-FDG uptake. The β-camera is capable of imaging radioactive uptake of (18)F-FDG in microfluidic chips. (18)F-FDG uptake for a single cell was measured using a radioactivity concentration of 37 MBq/mL during the radiotracer incubation period. For in vitro cytotoxicity monitoring, the β-camera showed that exposure to 1 μM PLX4032 for 3 days decreased the (18)F-FDG uptake per cell in highly sensitive M229 cells, compared with vehicle controls. The integrated β-camera and microfluidic chip can provide digital control of live cell cultures and allow in vitro quantitative radioassays for multiple samples simultaneously.	0
Correlation between SNPs in CDH1 and gastric cancer in Chinese population. ||  || Many recent studies revealed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms have considerable effects on the susceptibility of cancer, such as prostate cancer, lung cancer and gastric cancer. The E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by CDH1 gene, is critical for epithelial construction, intercellular adhesion and cell migration. Some associations have been reported between single nucleotide polymorphisms and gastric cancer in the Chinese population. To investigate whether the single nucleotide polymorphism in CDH1 gene is associated with the susceptibility of gastric cancer in the Chinese population. The genotypes of 5 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs33935154, rs121964871, rs121964874, rs121964875, rs121964876) were determined in 359 gastric cancer patients and 368 healthy controls. High resolution melting curve detection and sequencing analysis were used in the present study. There is a statistical significance in the rs121964871 C>G polymorphism between gastric cancer patients and healthy controls (OR=1.769, 95%CI: 1.051-2.976). Elderly male individuals (>50 years of age) carrying this risk factor may be more susceptible to gastric cancer. The results indicated that the rs121964871 C>G polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility of gastric cancer in the Chinese population, with some age and sex-dependent tendencies observed.	4
PRIMA-1met (APR-246) inhibits growth of colorectal cancer cells with different p53 status through distinct mechanisms. || Animals Caco-2 Cells Cell Proliferation Colorectal Neoplasms Disease Models, Animal HT29 Cells Humans Mice Mice, Inbred NOD Mice, SCID Quinuclidines Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || PRIMA-1met (APR-246) is a methylated derivative and structural analog of PRIMA-1 (p53 re-activation and induction of massive apoptosis). PRIMA-1met has been reported to restore both the wild type (wt) structure and function of mutant p53. Here, we show that PRIMA-1met is highly effective at limiting the growth of CRC cells regardless of p53 status. However, PRIMA-1met induces robust apoptosis only in CRC cells with mutant p53. Upregulation of Noxa, a proapoptotic molecule, is crucial for PRIMA-1met mediated activity. In human xenograft model of disease, PRIMA-1met effectively suppresses CRC tumor growth. Our results uncover distinct mechanisms of PRIMA-1met in CRC with different p53 status, thus providing a mechanistic rationale to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRIMA-1met in CRC patients with different p53 status.	0
GESPA: classifying nsSNPs to predict disease association. || DNA Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Internet Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proteins Sequence Analysis, DNA Software || Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are the most common DNA sequence variation associated with disease in humans. Thus determining the clinical significance of each nsSNP is of great importance. Potential detrimental nsSNPs may be identified by genetic association studies or by functional analysis in the laboratory, both of which are expensive and time consuming. Existing computational methods lack accuracy and features to facilitate nsSNP classification for clinical use. We developed the GESPA (GEnomic Single nucleotide Polymorphism Analyzer) program to predict the pathogenicity and disease phenotype of nsSNPs. GESPA is a user-friendly software package for classifying disease association of nsSNPs. It allows flexibility in acceptable input formats and predicts the pathogenicity of a given nsSNP by assessing the conservation of amino acids in orthologs and paralogs and supplementing this information with data from medical literature. The development and testing of GESPA was performed using the humsavar, ClinVar and humvar datasets. Additionally, GESPA also predicts the disease phenotype associated with a nsSNP with high accuracy, a feature unavailable in existing software. GESPA's overall accuracy exceeds existing computational methods for predicting nsSNP pathogenicity. The usability of GESPA is enhanced by fast SQL-based cloud storage and retrieval of data. GESPA is a novel bioinformatics tool to determine the pathogenicity and phenotypes of nsSNPs. We anticipate that GESPA will become a useful clinical framework for predicting the disease association of nsSNPs. The program, executable jar file, source code, GPL 3.0 license, user guide, and test data with instructions are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/gespa.	4
TP53 mutations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients: longitudinal follow-ups show the mutation is stable during disease evolution. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Disease Progression Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Mutation Proportional Hazards Models Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || The TP53 mutation is frequently detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with complex karyotype (CK), but the stability of this mutation during the clinical course remains unclear. In this study, TP53 mutations were identified in 7% of 500 patients with de novo AML and 58.8% of patients with CK. TP53 mutations were closely associated with older age, lower white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, FAB M6 subtype, unfavorable-risk cytogenetics and CK, but negatively associated with NPM1 mutation, FLT3/ITD and DNMT3A mutation. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that TP53 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival among the total cohort and the subgroup of patients with CK. A scoring system incorporating TP53 mutation and nine other prognostic factors, including age, WBC counts, cytogenetics and gene mutations, into survival analysis proved to be very useful to stratify AML patients. Sequential study of 420 samples showed that TP53 mutations were stable during AML evolution, whereas the mutation was acquired only in 1 of the 126 TP53 wild-type patients when therapy-related AML originated from different clone emerged. In conclusion, TP53 mutations are associated with distinct clinic-biological features and poor prognosis in de novo AML patients and are rather stable during disease progression.	4
DEC1 coordinates with HDAC8 to differentially regulate TAp73 and ΔNp73 expression. || Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors Cell Line DNA-Binding Proteins Gene Expression Regulation Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Histone Deacetylases Homeodomain Proteins Humans Nuclear Proteins Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Protein Isoforms Repressor Proteins Transcriptional Activation Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || P73, a member of the p53 family, plays a critical role in neural development and tumorigenesis. Due to the usage of two different promoters, p73 is expressed as two major isoforms, TAp73 and ΔNp73, often with opposing functions. Here, we reported that transcriptional factor DEC1, a target of the p53 family, exerts a distinct control of TAp73 and ΔNp73 expression. In particular, we showed that DEC1 was able to increase TAp73 expression via transcriptional activation of the TAp73 promoter. By contrast, Np73 transcription was inhibited by DEC1 via transcriptional repression of the ΔNp73 promoter. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we showed that DEC1 was unable to increase TAp73 expression in the absence of HDAC8, suggesting that HDAC8 is required for DEC1 to enhance TAp73 expression. Furthermore, we found that DEC1 was able to interact with HDAC8 and recruit HDAC8 to the TAp73, but not the ΔNp73, promoter. Together, our data provide evidence that DEC1 and HDAC8 in differentially regulate TAp73 and ΔNp73 expression, suggesting that this regulation may lay a foundation for a therapeutic strategy to enhance the chemosensitivity of tumor cells.	0
Targeted Resequencing of Putative Growth-Related Genes Using Whole Exome Sequencing in Patients with Severe Primary IGF-I Deficiency. || FAM111A Growth disorder Growth hormone receptor HRAS IGF2 Severe primary insulin-like growth factor deficiency Short stature Trio-based analysis Whole exome sequencing || To elucidate the genetic causes of severe primary insulin-like growth factor-I deficiency (SPIGFD) by systematic, targeted, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based resequencing of growth-related genes. Clinical phenotyping followed by NGS in 17 families including 6 affected sib pairs. We identified disease-causing, heterozygous, de novo variants in HRAS (p.Gly13Cys) and FAM111A (p.Arg569His) in 2 male patients with syndromic SPIGFD. A previously described homozygous GHR nonsense variant was detected in 2 siblings of a consanguineous family (p.Glu198*). Furthermore, we identified an inherited novel variant in the IGF2 gene (p.Arg156Cys) of a maternally imprinted gene in a less severely affected father and his affected daughter. We detected 2 other novel missense variants in SH2B1 and SOCS2, both were inherited from an unaffected parent. Screening of growth-related genes using NGS-based, large-scale, targeted resequencing identified disease-causing variants in HRAS, FAM111A, and GHR. Considering the increased risk of subjects with HRAS mutations for neoplasms, close clinical monitoring and a thorough discussion of the risk/benefit ratio of the treatment with recombinant IGF-I is mandatory. Segregation analysis proved to be critical in the interpretation of potential SPIGFD-associated gene variations.	4
Molecular characterization of Chilean patients with a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. || Child Chile Exons Humans Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 || Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by typical dysmorphic features, cardiac anomalies as well as postnatal growth retardation, and is associated with Ras-MAPK pathway gene mutations. The purpose of this study was to improve the diagnosis of Chilean patients with suspected NS through molecular analysis. We screened 18 Chilean patients with a clinical diagnosis of NS for mutations in PTPN11 by high resolution melting (HRM) and subsequent sequencing. Three PTPN11 missense mutations were detected in 22% of analyzed patients. Of these, two (c.181G>A and c.1510A>G) were previously reported and one was the novel substitution c.328G>A (p.E110K) affecting the linker stretch between the N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains of SHP-2 protein. Molecular studies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of NS in 4 of 18 patients, which provided support for therapeutic decisions and improved genetic counseling for their families.	4
Exome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations in NF1 and RASopathy genes in sun-exposed melanomas. || Antineoplastic Agents Benzimidazoles DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Exome Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Kaplan-Meier Estimate Loss of Heterozygosity Male Melanoma Mutation, Missense Neurofibromin 1 Sequence Analysis, RNA Skin Neoplasms Sunlight Tumor Cells, Cultured ras Proteins || We report on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 213 melanomas. Our analysis established NF1, encoding a negative regulator of RAS, as the third most frequently mutated gene in melanoma, after BRAF and NRAS. Inactivating NF1 mutations were present in 46% of melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF and RAS, occurred in older patients and showed a distinct pattern of co-mutation with other RASopathy genes, particularly RASA2. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs. We conclude that NF1 is a key tumor suppressor lost in melanomas, and that concurrent RASopathy gene mutations may enhance its role in melanomagenesis.	0
Impairment of the DNA repair and growth arrest pathways by p53R2 silencing enhances DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner in prostate cancer cells. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor DNA Damage DNA Repair Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Silencing Genes, Dominant Genes, p53 Humans Male Prostatic Neoplasms RNA, Small Interfering Ribonucleotide Reductases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53R2 is a p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase that contributes to DNA repair by supplying deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools in response to DNA damage. In this study, we found that p53R2 was overexpressed in prostate tumor cell lines compared with immortalized prostatic epithelial cells and that the protein was induced upon DNA damage. We investigated the effects of p53R2 silencing on DNA damage in LNCaP cells (wild-type p53). Silencing p53R2 potentiated the apoptotic effects of ionizing radiation and doxorubicin treatment as shown by increased sub-G(1) content and decreased colony formation. This sensitizing effect was specific to DNA-damaging agents. Comet assay and gamma-H2AX phosphorylation status showed that the decreased p53R2 levels inhibited DNA repair. Silencing p53R2 also reduced the levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) at the posttranscriptional level, suggesting links between the p53-dependent DNA repair and cell cycle arrest pathways. Using LNCaP sublines stably expressing dominant-negative mutant p53, we found that the sensitizing effect of p53R2 silencing is mediated by p53-dependent apoptosis pathways. In the LNCaP sublines (R273H, R248W, and G245S) that have defects in inducing p53-dependent apoptosis, p53R2 silencing did not potentiate DNA damage-induced apoptosis, whereas p53R2 silencing was effective in a LNCaP subline (P151S) which retains the ability to induce p53-dependent apoptosis. This study shows that p53R2 is a potential therapeutic target that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of ionizing radiation or DNA-damaging chemotherapy in a subset of patients with prostate cancer.	0
Phenylketonuria in Iranian population: a study in institutions for mentally retarded in Isfahan. || Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Gene Frequency Humans Institutionalization Intellectual Disability Iran Leukocytes Mass Screening Microbial Sensitivity Tests Mutation Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Restriction Mapping || Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is caused by mutations in the PAH gene (12q22-q24) resulting in a primary deficiency of the PAH enzyme activity, intolerance to the dietary intake of phenylalanine (Phe) and production of the phenylketonuria (PKU) disease. To date there have been no reports on the molecular analysis of PKU in Iranian population. In this study, the states of the PKU disease in terms of prevalence and mutation spectrum among patients reside in the institutions for mentally retarded in Isfahan was investigated. In the first step, 611 out of 1541 patients with PKU phenotype or severe mental retardation were screened for the PKU disease using the Guthrie bacterial inhibition assay (GBIA) followed by HPLC. Among the patients screened 34 (5.56%) were found positive with abnormal serum Phe of above 7mg/dl. In the next step, the presence of 18 common mutations of the PAH gene in 26 of the patients with classical PKU (serum Phe above 20mg/dl) was investigated, using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Of the 52 independent mutant alleles that were analyzed, 34 (65.38%) were genotyped showing 8 mutations as follows: R252W (15.38%), Q232Q (13.46%), R261Q (7.69%), delL364 (7.69%), IVS10-11g>a (5.77%), L333F (5.77%), V245V (5.77%) and S67P (3.85%). The results from this study may serve as a reference to analyze the PKU mutations in other part of Iran, and to establish diagnostic tests for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of the PKU disease in Iranian population.	1 3
Occurrence of Neuroblastoma among TP53 p.R337H Carriers. || Alleles Child, Preschool Female Genes, p53 Heterozygote Humans Incidence Male Mutation Neuroblastoma Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Prognosis || The high incidence of adrenocortical tumors and choroid plexus carcinoma in children from South and Southeastern regions of Brazil is associated with the germline p.R337H mutation of TP53 gene. The concomitant occurrence of neuroblastoma and adrenocortical tumors in pediatric patients harboring the p.R337H mutation at our institution prompted us to investigate the putative association between p.R337H and pediatric neuroblastoma. Genomic DNA samples from 83 neuroblastoma patients referred to a single institution during the period of 2000-2014 were screened for the p.R337H mutation. Available samples from carriers were investigated for both nuclear p53 accumulation and loss of heterozigosity in tumor. Clinical data were obtained from medical records in order to assess the impact of 337H allele on manifestation of the disease. Seven out 83 neuroblastoma patients (8.4%) were carriers of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in our cohort. Immunohistochemical analysis of p.R337H-positive tumors revealed nuclear p53 accumulation. Loss of heterozigosity was not found among available samples. The presence of 337H allele was associated with increased proportion of stage I tumors. Our data indicate that in addition to adrenocortical tumors, choroid plexus carcinoma, breast cancer and osteosarcoma, genetic counseling and clinical surveillance should consider neuroblastoma as a potential neoplasia affecting p.R337H carriers.	4
Molecular mechanisms of disease-causing missense mutations. || Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Mutation, Missense Protein Stability Proteins || Genetic variations resulting in a change of amino acid sequence can have a dramatic effect on stability, hydrogen bond network, conformational dynamics, activity and many other physiologically important properties of proteins. The substitutions of only one residue in a protein sequence, so-called missense mutations, can be related to many pathological conditions and may influence susceptibility to disease and drug treatment. The plausible effects of missense mutations range from affecting the macromolecular stability to perturbing macromolecular interactions and cellular localization. Here we review the individual cases and genome-wide studies that illustrate the association between missense mutations and diseases. In addition, we emphasize that the molecular mechanisms of effects of mutations should be revealed in order to understand the disease origin. Finally, we report the current state-of-the-art methodologies that predict the effects of mutations on protein stability, the hydrogen bond network, pH dependence, conformational dynamics and protein function.	0
Emerging LDL therapies: Using human genetics to discover new therapeutic targets for plasma lipids. || Cholesterol, LDL Genetics, Medical Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Serine Endopeptidases || In humans, genetic variation occurs through different types of alleles that vary in frequency and severity of effect. Mendelian mutations, such as those in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) that result in familial hypercholesterolemia, are rare and have powerful phenotypic effects. Conversely, alleles that are common in the population (such that homozygotes for the minor allele are present even in modest sample sizes) typically have very modest phenotypic effects. In the middle of the spectrum are "Goldilocks" alleles such as mutations in the gene for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 result in significantly decreased LDL-cholesterol levels and a disproportionately large reduction in coronary heart disease risk by reducing the exposure to LDL-cholesterol throughout life. Several agents to inhibit PCSK9 are currently in development, demonstrating the potential utility of translating genetics into clinical therapeutics. To date, most investigations aimed at identifying the genes responsible for hypercholesterolemia have used linkage analysis, which requires samples collected from multiple families with defects in the same gene, or common variant analysis which requires thousands of samples from the population. However, case studies have shown that with advances in whole genome sequencing or exome sequencing (targeted exome capture), the process of discovering causal genetic mutations can be significantly streamlined. Astute clinical observation of individual patients and their families with atypical lipid profiles, followed by sequencing of the affected individual, has the potential to lead to important findings regarding the genetic mutations that cause lipid abnormalities.	4
TP53 codon 72 Gene Polymorphism Paradox in Associated with Various Carcinoma Incidences, Invasiveness and Chemotherapy Responses. ||  || TP53 is the most common mutated gene in human cancers. Approximately half of all human malignancies exhibit TP53 mutations. The TP53 codon 72 polymorphism is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 4, resulting in the expression of either arginine (CGC) or proline (CCC) residues. In this article, we review literatures published in MEDLINE, and attempt to describe how these two polymorphic variants of TP53 are functionally distinct, and how they influence cancer vulnerability and response to chemotherapy. The Arg72 variant has been shown to be more likely to induce apoptosis than the Pro72 variant, due to its ability to localize itself to mitochondria and trigger the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. However, the influence of the TP53 codon 72 polymorphism on the risk of developing various cancers, and their progression remains inconclusive because there has been no sustained evidence supporting a crucial role for the codon 72 variant in cancer therapy till now. We hypothesize that TP53 gene might not only be involved in cell cycle control and the apoptosis induction response to DNA damage, but may also modulate individual cancer risk, and that this may correlate with the biofunctions of the two codon 72 variants. Additionally, latent factors might function synergistically with codon 72 variants to confer susceptibility to cancer development, progression, prognosis, and therapeutic responsiveness. Further etiological investigations are essential to reveal the association of and interaction between genetic and environmental factors in relation to carcinogenesis.	0
Interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein as prognostic biomarkers in metastatic colorectal cancer. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor C-Reactive Protein Colorectal Neoplasms Combined Modality Therapy Female Genes, ras Humans Inflammation Mediators Interleukin-6 Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Time Factors Treatment Outcome Young Adult || The aim was to explore the prognostic significance of IL-6 and markers of systemic inflammatory response (SIR), in particular C-reactive protein (CRP), in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, in the total study population and according to RAS and BRAF mutation status. High levels of pretreatment serum IL-6 or CRP were associated with impaired outcome, in terms of reduced PFS and OS. Patients with low versus high serum IL-6 levels had median OS of 26.0 versus 16.6 months, respectively (P < 0.001). Stratified according to increasing CRP levels, median OS varied from 24.3 months to 12.3 months, (P < 0.001). IL-6 and CRP levels affected overall prognosis also in adjusted analyses. The effect of IL-6 was particularly pronounced in patients with BRAF mutation (interaction P = 0.004). IL-6 and CRP were determined in pre-treatment serum samples from 393 patients included in the NORDIC-VII trial, in which patients with mCRC received first line treatment. The effect of serum IL-6 and CRP on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was estimated. High baseline serum consentrations of IL-6 or CRP were associated with impaired prognosis in mCRC. IL-6 and CRP give independent prognostic information in addition to RAS and BRAF mutation status.	4
An unexpected new role of mutant Ras: perturbation of human embryonic development. || Abnormalities, Multiple Embryonic Development Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Syndrome ras Proteins || The Ras signaling pathway controls important cellular responses to growth factors, and somatic mutations in RAS genes and other components of the Ras pathway, such as PTPN11 (encoding the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2) and BRAF, are found in human malignancies. Ras proteins are guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins that cycle between active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound and inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound conformations. Neoplasia-associated Ras mutations frequently affect amino acids G12, G13, or Q61 and decrease the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity by ten- to twentyfold. The GTPase activity is crucial for Ras inactivation by hydrolysis and release of a phosphate group from Ras.GTP to produce Ras.GDP. We and others have recently discovered germline mutations in the KRAS gene in individuals diagnosed with Noonan and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, two clinically overlapping disorders characterized by short stature, distinct facial anomalies, heart defects, and other abnormalities. Noonan syndrome-associated mutations V14I and T58I K-Ras activate Ras but have milder biochemical effects than somatic mutations encountered in cancers, offering an explanation why these K-Ras lesions are tolerated during embryonic development. Together with recent findings of BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 mutations in CFC syndrome and HRAS mutations in Costello syndrome, another clinically related disorder, it has now become clear that Noonan-like features (short stature, relative macrocephaly, facial anomalies, learning difficulties) that are found in these three related disorders are a result of constitutive activation of the Ras-Raf-extracellular signal-regulated and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.	0
Oncogenic RAS enables DNA damage- and p53-dependent differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells in response to chemotherapy. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Bone Marrow Cells Cell Differentiation Cell Proliferation Cellular Senescence Cytarabine Daunorubicin Etoposide Genes, ras Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Mutation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 ras Proteins || Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disease originating from myeloid progenitor cells with a heterogeneous genetic background. High-dose cytarabine is used as the standard consolidation chemotherapy. Oncogenic RAS mutations are frequently observed in AML, and are associated with beneficial response to cytarabine. Why AML-patients with oncogenic RAS benefit most from high-dose cytarabine post-remission therapy is not well understood. Here we used bone marrow cells expressing a conditional MLL-ENL-ER oncogene to investigate the interaction of oncogenic RAS and chemotherapeutic agents. We show that oncogenic RAS synergizes with cytotoxic agents such as cytarabine in activation of DNA damage checkpoints, resulting in a p53-dependent genetic program that reduces clonogenicity and increases myeloid differentiation. Our data can explain the beneficial effects observed for AML patients with oncogenic RAS treated with higher dosages of cytarabine and suggest that induction of p53-dependent differentiation, e.g. by interfering with Mdm2-mediated degradation, may be a rational approach to increase cure rate in response to chemotherapy. The data also support the notion that the therapeutic success of cytotoxic drugs may depend on their ability to promote the differentiation of tumor-initiating cells.	0

To identify new therapeutic targets, we performed a mutation analysis of kinase genes in glioblastoma. Database mining and a literature search identified 76 kinases that have been found to be mutated at least twice in multiple cancer types before. Among those we selected 34 kinase genes for mutation analysis. We also included IDH1, IDH2, PTEN, TP53 and NRAS, genes that are known to be mutated at considerable frequencies in glioblastoma. In total, 174 exons of 39 genes in 113 glioblastoma samples from 109 patients and 16 high-grade glioma (HGG) cell lines were sequenced. Our mutation analysis led to the identification of 148 non-synonymous somatic mutations, of which 25 have not been reported before in glioblastoma. Somatic mutations were found in TP53, PTEN, IDH1, PIK3CA, EGFR, BRAF, EPHA3, NRAS, TGFBR2, FLT3 and RPS6KC1. Mapping the mutated genes into known signaling pathways revealed that the large majority of them plays a central role in the PI3K-AKT pathway. The knowledge that at least 50% of glioblastoma tumors display mutational activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway should offer new opportunities for the rational development of therapeutic approaches for glioblastomas. However, due to the development of resistance mechanisms, kinase inhibition studies targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway for relapsing glioblastoma have mostly failed thus far. Other therapies should be investigated, targeting early events in gliomagenesis that involve both kinases and non-kinases.	4
Molecular mechanisms in the selective basal activation of pyrabactin receptor 1: Comparative analysis of mutants. ||  || Pyrabactin receptors (PYR) play a central role in abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction; they are ABA receptors that inhibit type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2C). Molecular aspects contributing to increased basal activity of PYR against PP2C are studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An extensive series of MD simulations of the apo-form of mutagenized PYR1 as a homodimer and in complex with homology to ABA-insensitive 1 (HAB1) phosphatase are reported. In order to investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms mediating PYR1 activity, the MD data was analyzed by essential collective dynamics (ECD), a novel approach that allows the identification, with atomic resolution, of persistent dynamic correlations based on relatively short MD trajectories. Employing the ECD method, the effects of select mutations on the structure and dynamics of the PYR1 complexes were investigated and considered in the context of experimentally determined constitutive activities against HAB1. Approaches to rationally design constitutively active PYR1 constructs to increase PP2C inhibition are discussed.	0
Improvement of bone mineral density after enzyme replacement therapy in Chinese late-onset Pompe disease patients. || Adult Age of Onset Bone Density Enzyme Replacement Therapy Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Osteoporosis Young Adult || Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a lysosomal storage disease resulted from deficiency of the enzyme acid α-glucosidase. Patients usually develop a limb-girdle pattern of myopathy and respiratory impairment, and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only specific treatment available. Recently, LOPD has been associated with low bone mineral density (BMD), but the effect of ERT on BMD is inconclusive. In this report we described our early observations on the change of BMD after ERT in Chinese LOPD patients. We studied four Chinese LOPD patients with different severities of myopathy. All were underweight, and three had osteoporosis at baseline. We found significant weight gain in three patients after ERT and all four patients showed improvement in BMD. The biggest improvement, 84.4% increase in BMD, was seen in a lady with the most prominent weight recovery. Our results suggest that ERT improves BMD in Chinese LOPD and weight gain could be a major contributor to this effect.	1
Inhibition of the p53 Y220C Mutant by 1-Hydroxy-2- Methylanthraquinone Derivatives: A Novel Strategy for Cancer Therapy. ||  || Y220C, a substitution mutation in p53, causes major structural changes in the protein and is known to form a new protein cavity. This cavity is reckoned to accommodate small drug candidates that may play a key role in cancer treatment. Present study was aimed at determining a drug candidate that could inhibit the mutant p53 based on structural drug rationale. Docking of mutated p53 was performed to determine the drug of choice from the derivatives of 1-hydroxy-2- methylanthraquinone exhibiting anti-cancer properties. The cavity had been tested for identification of an accurate position vector for molecular docking studies using structure based drug design. The docked structure was validated using discovery studio 3.5. The best choice of two molecules were obtained by docking in specific solvent for 6 nanoseconds at a temperature of 310 K. Out of a library of compounds, acetamido-2-carboxy-4-dimethylamino-2- hydroxybenzophenone satisfied the ADMET and was found to be a potential target for mutant p53. This ligand binds at the active site of the protein. Results of present study offer a rationale of the lead ligands that can rescue oncogenic p53 by targeting the mutation site. Therefore, it is suggestive that small molecules may serve as an effective and novel anti-cancer drug.	0
Typing of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms by a microsphere-based rolling circle amplification assay. || Base Sequence Cell Line, Tumor DNA DNA Primers Flow Cytometry Humans Microspheres Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || The combination of suspension array with rolling circle amplification can lead to a sensitive and specific assay for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detection, as demonstrated in this study. A circular template generated by ligation upon the recognition of a point mutation on DNA targets was amplified isothermally by the Phi29 polymerase on microspheres. The elongation products were labeled with fluorochrome-tagged probes and detected in a flow cytometer, indicating the mutation occurrence. As low as 10 amol of mutated strands was detected by this assay, and positive mutation detection was achieved with a wild-type to mutant ratio of 10 000:1, which could be attributed to the high amplification efficiency of Phi29, the high binding capacity of the microspheres, and the remarkable precision of DNA ligase in distinguishing mismatched bases at the ligation site. A novel design of using two differently labeled detection probes on the same microsphere to target both the wild-type and mutant samples allowed parallel determination of the heterozygosity for two SNPs (K-ras G12C and TP53 R273H) in PCR amplicons prepared from human genomic DNA extracts. This ability lays the groundwork for further enhancing the assay throughput by using multiple fluorophores and microspheres with distinct properties.	0
Discrimination of p53 immunohistochemistry-positive tumors by its staining pattern in gastric cancer. || Aged Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17 Comparative Genomic Hybridization Female Gene Expression Humans Immunohistochemistry Lymphatic Metastasis Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Neovascularization, Pathologic Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Stomach Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Immunohistochemistry staining of p53 is a cheap and simple method to detect aberrant function of p53. However, there are some discrepancies between the result of immunohistochemistry staining and mutation analysis. This study attempted to find a new definition of p53 staining by its staining pattern. Immunohistochemistry staining of p53 and TP53 gene mutation analysis were performed in 148 gastric cancer patients. Also SNP-CGH array analysis was conducted to four cases. Positive staining of p53 was observed in 88 (59.5%) tumors. Tumors with positive p53 staining showed malignant features compared to negative tumors. Mutation of TP53 gene was observed in 29 (19.6%) tumors with higher age and differentiated type. In positive p53 tumors, two types could be distinguished; aberrant type and scattered type. With comparison to TP53 gene mutation analysis, all the scattered type had wild-type TP53 gene (P = 0.0003). SNP-CGH array showed that scattered-type tumors had no change in the structure of chromosome 17. P53-scattered-type staining tumors may reflect a functionally active nonmutated TP53 gene. In interpretation of p53 immunohistochemistry staining, distinguishing p53-positive tumors by their staining pattern may be important in gastric cancer.	4
The presence of wild type p53 in hematological cancers improves the efficacy of combinational therapy targeting metabolism. || AMP-Activated Protein Kinases Animals Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Benzoquinones Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Dichloroacetic Acid Doxorubicin Drug Synergism HCT116 Cells HL-60 Cells Humans Lactams, Macrocyclic Leukemia Mice Oxidative Phosphorylation Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Manipulation of metabolic pathways in hematological cancers has therapeutic potential. Here, we determined the molecular mechanism of action of the metabolic modulator dichloroacetate (DCA) in leukemic cells. We found that DCA induces the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/p53 pathway with increased efficacy in tumors expressing wild type (wt p53). Clinically relevant, low concentrations of doxorubicin synergize in vitro and in vivo with DCA to further enhance p53 activation and to block tumor progression. Leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells containing mutant p53 are resistant to the above-described combination approach. However, DCA synergized with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG to specifically eliminate these cells. Our studies strongly indicate that depending on the p53 status, different combination therapies would provide better treatment with decreased side effects in hematological cancers.	0
Spectrum and frequencies of mutations in the GJB2 (Cx26) gene among 156 Czech patients with pre-lingual deafness. || Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins Czech Republic DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Deafness Humans Mutation Sequence Analysis, DNA || Mutations in the gene gap junction beta 2 (GJB2), the gene for the connexin 26, are the most common cause of pre-lingual deafness worldwide. The mutation 35delG within GJB2 is prevalent in Europe. To date, there are no data about GJB2 mutation spectrum and frequencies from the Czech population. We investigated and report here the spectrum and frequencies of mutations in the GJB2 gene among 156 unrelated, congenital deafness Czech patients. Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, together with fluorescent fragment analysis, were used for the detection of the 35delG mutation. The entire coding region of the GJB2 was directly sequenced in all patients who were not homozygous for the 35delG. No pathogenic mutation was detected in 51.9% of patients. At least one pathogenic mutation was found in 48.1% of patients, and both pathogenic mutations were detected in 37.8% of patients. Single mutations in a heterozygous state were detected in 10.3% of patients. The mutation 35delG accounts for 82.8% of detected disease mutations, Trp24stop accounts for 9.7% of pathogenic alleles and was found in patients with gypsy heritage. Mutation 313del14 accounts for 3.7% of pathogenic alleles. The frequency of 35delG heterozygotes in the Czech Republic is 1 : 29.6. Testing for only the three most common mutations would detect over 96% of all pathogenic alleles in the Czech Republic.	4
p53 is critical for the Aurora B kinase inhibitor-mediated apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. || Apoptosis Aurora Kinase B Aurora Kinases Cell Division Cell Line, Tumor Drug Resistance, Neoplasm HL-60 Cells Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Protein Kinase Inhibitors Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Quinazolines RNA, Small Interfering Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || We previously showed that AZD1152-HQPA, the inhibitor of Aurora B kinase potently induced growth arrest and apoptosis of various types of human leukemia cells including MV4-11 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, although the molecular mechanisms by which this class of kinase inhibitors induces apoptosis remain to be fully elucidated. We have recently established the MV4-11 subline, designated as MV4-11 TP53 R248W, which possesses transcriptionally inactive R248W mutation in the TP53 gene. MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells were relatively resistant to AZD1152-HQPA-mediated growth arrest, as measured by MTT and clonogenic assays. AZD1152-HQPA (10-100 nM, 48 h) strikingly induced apoptosis of MV4-11 cells, as assessed by Annexin V binding, loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential, and activation of caspase cascade, in parallel with up-regulation of p53 and its target molecules Bax and Noxa. Notably, AZD1152-HQPA (10-100 nM, 48 h) induced polyploidy rather than apoptosis in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. The polyploid cells were eventually eliminated via apoptosis at later time period (72-120 h) in association with up-regulation of p73. Taken together, p53 plays an important role in AZD1152-HQPA-induced growth arrest and early onset of apoptosis in AML cells. P73 may mediate the late onset of apoptosis to eliminate the polyploid cells caused by the inhibitor of Aurora B kinase.	0
Filaggrin gene defects are independent risk factors for atopic asthma in a Polish population: a study in ECAP cohort. || Adolescent Adult Asthma Child Cohort Studies Dermatitis, Atopic European Union Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetics, Population Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Intermediate Filament Proteins Multicenter Studies as Topic Mutation, Missense Poland Polymorphism, Genetic Risk Factors Sequence Deletion Young Adult || FLG null variants of which 2282del4 and R501X are the most frequent in Caucasians are established risk factors for atopic dermatitis (AD) with an effect probably mediated through impairment of epidermal barrier. Among subjects with AD FLG defects are also consistently associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) but it is less clear to what extent these associations are also present independently from skin disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of 2282del4 and R501X in predisposing to these allergic phenotypes in a Polish population. 2282del4 and R501X were typed among 3,802 participants of the Epidemiology of Allergic Diseases in Poland (ECAP) survey, a cross-sectional population-based study using ECRHS II and ISAAC questionnaires, and ambulatory examination. The FLG null variants were associated with AD (OR = 2.01, CI: 1.20-3.36, P = 0.007), allergic rhinitis (in particular persistent form, OR = 1.69, CI:1.12-2.54, P = 0.011), and asthma (in particular atopic asthma, OR = 2.22, CI:1.24-3.96, P = 0.006). Association with atopic asthma (but not persistent allergic rhinitis) was also present in the absence of AD, (OR = 2.02, CI: 1.07-3.81, P = 0.027) as well as in the absence of AD and history of broadly defined inflammatory skin disease (OR = 2.30, CI: 1.07-4.93, P = 0.03). Association to atopic asthma would have not been found if diagnosis was made by questionnaire only (OR = 1.15, CI: 0.58-2.32, P = 0.8). We did not observe an association between FLG variants and allergic sensitizations (P = 0.8) or total IgE. (P = 0.6). In a Polish population FLG 2282del4 and R501X carriage increases risk for development of AD and atopic asthma (also in the absence of AD or history thereof). This suggests that interventions aimed at restoring epidermal barrier may have a general role in asthma prophylaxis/treatment.	4
Lower carrier rate of GJB2 W24X ancestral Indian mutation in Roma samples from Hungary: implication for public health intervention. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Connexin 26 Connexins Female Gene Frequency Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Hungary Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Roma Young Adult || The purpose of this work was to characterise the W24X mutation of the GJB2 gene in order to provide more representative and geographicaly relevant carrier rates of healthy Roma subisolates and the Hungarian population. 493 Roma and 498 Hungarian healthy subjects were genotyped for the GJB2 c.71G>A (rs104894396, W24X) mutation by PCR-RFLP assay and direct sequencing. This is the first report on GJB2 W24X mutation in geographically subisolated Roma population of Hungary compared to local Hungarians. Comparing the genotype and allele frequencies of GJB2 rs104894396 mutation, significant difference was found in GG (98.4 vs. 99.8 %), GA (1.62 vs. 0.20 %) genotypes and A (0.8 vs. 0.1 %) allele between the Roma and Hungarian populations, respectively (p < 0.02). None of the subjects of Roma and Hungarian samples carried the GJB2 W24X AA genotype. Considerable result of our study, that the proportion of GJB2 W24X GA heterozygotes and the A allele frequency was eight times higher in Roma than in Hungarians. Considering the results, the mutant allele frequency both in Roma (0.8 %) and in Hungarian (0.1 %) populations is lower than expected from previous results, likely reflecting local differentiated subisolates of these populations and a suspected lower risk for GJB2 mutation related deafness. However, the significant difference in GJB2 W24X carrier rates between the Roma and Hungarians may initiate individual diagnostic investigations and effective public health interventions.	4
Genotyping with a 198 mutation arrayed primer extension array for hereditary hearing loss: assessment of its diagnostic value for medical practice. || Anion Transport Proteins Connexins Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Sulfate Transporters || Molecular diagnostic testing of individuals with congenital sensorineural hearing loss typically begins with DNA sequencing of the GJB2 gene. If the cause of the hearing loss is not identified in GJB2, additional testing can be ordered. However, the step-wise analysis of several genes often results in a protracted diagnostic process. The more comprehensive Hereditary Hearing Loss Arrayed Primer Extension microarray enables analysis of 198 mutations across eight genes (GJB2, GJB6, GJB3, GJA1, SLC26A4, SLC26A5, MTRNR1 and MTTS1) in a single test. To evaluate the added diagnostic value of this microarray for our ethnically diverse patient population, we tested 144 individuals with congenital sensorineural hearing loss who were negative for biallelic GJB2 or GJB6 mutations. The array successfully detected all GJB2 changes previously identified in the study group, confirming excellent assay performance. Additional mutations were identified in the SLC26A4, SLC26A5 and MTRNR1 genes of 12/144 individuals (8.3%), four of whom (2.8%) had genotypes consistent with pathogenicity. These results suggest that the current format of this microarray falls short of adding diagnostic value beyond the customary testing of GJB2, perhaps reflecting the array's limitations on the number of mutations included for each gene, but more likely resulting from unknown genetic contributors to this phenotype. We conclude that mutations in other hearing loss associated genes should be incorporated in the array as knowledge of the etiology of hearing loss evolves. Such future modification of the flexible configuration of the Hereditary Hearing Loss Arrayed Primer Extension microarray would improve its impact as a diagnostic tool.	4
Thyroid cancers of follicular origin in a genomic light: in-depth overview of common and unique molecular marker candidates. || Biomarkers, Tumor Diagnosis, Differential Female Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Sequence Analysis, DNA Thyroid Neoplasms || In recent years, thyroid malignances have become more prevalent, especially among women. The most common sporadic types of thyroid tumors of follicular origin include papillary, follicular and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Although modern diagnosis methods enable the identification of tumors of small diameter, tumor subtype differentiation, which is imperative for the correct choice of treatment, is still troublesome. This review discusses the recent advances in the field of molecular marker identification via next-generation sequencing and microarrays. The potential use of these biomarkers to distinguish among the most commonly occurring sporadic thyroid cancers is presented and compared. Geographical heterogeneity might be a differentiator, although not necessarily a limiting factor, in biomarker selection. The available data advocate for a subset of mutations common for the three subtypes as well as mutations that are unique for a particular tumor subtype. Tumor heterogeneity, a known issue occurring within solid malignancies, is also discussed where applicable. Public databases with datasets derived from high-throughput experiments are a valuable source of information that aid biomarker research in general, including the identification of molecular hallmarks of thyroid cancer.	4
Constitutive activation of G protein-coupled receptors and diseases: insights into mechanisms of activation and therapeutics. || Animals Disease Models, Animal Drug Inverse Agonism Humans Mutation Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled Rhodopsin Sequence Homology, Amino Acid Structural Homology, Protein || The existence of constitutive activity for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) was first described in 1980s. In 1991, the first naturally occurring constitutively active mutations in GPCRs that cause diseases were reported in rhodopsin. Since then, numerous constitutively active mutations that cause human diseases were reported in several additional receptors. More recently, loss of constitutive activity was postulated to also cause diseases. Animal models expressing some of these mutants confirmed the roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of the diseases. Detailed functional studies of these naturally occurring mutations, combined with homology modeling using rhodopsin crystal structure as the template, lead to important insights into the mechanism of activation in the absence of crystal structure of GPCRs in active state. Search for inverse agonists on these receptors will be critical for correcting the diseases cause by activating mutations in GPCRs. Theoretically, these inverse agonists are better therapeutics than neutral antagonists in treating genetic diseases caused by constitutively activating mutations in GPCRs.	0
Coexpression of the type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene variants KCNJ11 E23K and ABCC8 S1369A alter the ATP and sulfonylurea sensitivities of the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel. || ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters Adenosine Triphosphate Amino Acid Substitution Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Homozygote KATP Channels Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying Receptors, Drug Sulfonylurea Compounds Sulfonylurea Receptors || In the pancreatic beta-cell, ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels couple metabolism with excitability and consist of Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits encoded by KCNJ11 and ABCC8, respectively. Sulfonylureas, which inhibit the K(ATP) channel, are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Rare activating mutations cause neonatal diabetes, whereas the common variants, E23K in KCNJ11 and S1369A in ABCC8, are in strong linkage disequilibrium, constituting a haplotype that predisposes to type 2 diabetes. To date it has not been possible to establish which of these represents the etiological variant, and functional studies are inconsistent. Furthermore, there have been no studies of the S1369A variant or the combined effect of the two on K(ATP) channel function. The patch-clamp technique was used to study the nucleotide sensitivity and sulfonylurea inhibition of recombinant human K(ATP) channels containing either the K23/A1369 or E23/S1369 variants. ATP sensitivity of the K(ATP) channel was decreased in the K23/A1369 variant (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 8.0 vs. 2.5 mumol/l for the E23/S1369 variant), although there was no difference in ADP sensitivity. The K23/A1369 variant also displayed increased inhibition by gliclazide, an A-site sulfonylurea drug (IC(50) = 52.7 vs. 188.7 nmol/l for the E23/S1369 variant), but not by glibenclamide (AB site) or repaglinide (B site). Our findings indicate that the common K23/A1369 variant K(ATP) channel displays decreased ATP inhibition that may contribute to the observed increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the increased sensitivity of the K23/A1369 variant to the A-site sulfonylurea drug gliclazide may provide a pharmacogenomic therapeutic approach for patients with type 2 diabetes who are homozygous for both risk alleles.	4
Abnormal calcium handling properties underlie familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathology in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. || Calcium Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Cells, Cultured Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Mutation, Missense Myosin Heavy Chains || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a prevalent hereditary cardiac disorder linked to arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. While the causes of HCM have been identified as genetic mutations in the cardiac sarcomere, the pathways by which sarcomeric mutations engender myocyte hypertrophy and electrophysiological abnormalities are not understood. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying HCM development, we generated patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from a ten-member family cohort carrying a hereditary HCM missense mutation (Arg663His) in the MYH7 gene. Diseased iPSC-CMs recapitulated numerous aspects of the HCM phenotype including cellular enlargement and contractile arrhythmia at the single-cell level. Calcium (Ca(2+)) imaging indicated dysregulation of Ca(2+) cycling and elevation in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) are central mechanisms for disease pathogenesis. Pharmacological restoration of Ca(2+) homeostasis prevented development of hypertrophy and electrophysiological irregularities. We anticipate that these findings will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying HCM development and identify novel therapies for the disease.	4
Genetic analysis of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Child, Preschool DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Family Health Female Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Infant Karyotyping Male Mutation, Missense Nuclear Proteins Pedigree Phenotype Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor Transcription Factors Twist-Related Protein 1 || Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a common craniosynostosis syndrome characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies. Intragenic mutations of the TWIST gene within 7p21 have been identified as a cause of this disorder. There is phenotypic overlap with other craniosynostosis syndromes, and intragenic mutations in FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2) and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) have been demonstrated in the other conditions. Furthermore, complete gene deletions of TWIST have also been found in a significant proportion of patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. We investigated 11 patients clinically identified as having the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype and 4 patients with craniosynostosis but without a clear diagnosis. Of the patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype, four were found to carry the FGFR3 P250R mutation, three were found to be heterozygous for three different novel mutations in the coding region of TWIST, and two were found to have a deletion of one copy of the entire TWIST gene. Developmental delay was a distinguishing feature of the patients with deletions, compared to patients with intragenic mutations of TWIST, in agreement with the results of Johnson et al. [1998: Am J Hum Genet 63:1282-1293]. No mutations were found for the four patients with craniosynostosis without a clear diagnosis. Therefore, 9 of our 11 patients (82%) with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype had detectable genetic changes in FGFR3 or TWIST. We propose that initial screening for the FGFR3 P250R mutation, followed by sequencing of TWIST and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletion detection of TWIST, is sufficient to detect mutations in > 80% of patients with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype.	4
Structural and functional analyses of mutations of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Base Sequence Blotting, Western COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops DNA Primers Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutagenesis Mutation, Missense Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Protein Conformation Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Sequence Homology, Amino Acid || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism that results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). We demonstrated PAH mutational spectrum from patients with PKU, including 10 novel and 3 tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4))-responsive mutations. In this study, 11 PAH missense mutations, including 6 novel mutations (P69S, G103S, L293M, G332V, S391I, A447P) found in our previous study, 2 mutations common in east Asian patients with PKU (R243Q, R413P), and 3 tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4))-responsive mutations (R53H, R241C, R408Q) have been functionally and structurally analyzed. A transient protein overexpression system and an in vitro BH(4)-responsiveness study were used. The effects of PAH missense mutations on the PAH protein structure were also analyzed. To determine the conservation of 12 mutated residues, PAH was aligned using BLAST against full genomic sequences of 221 different species. Model structures of PAH protein and the composite tetramer were constructed using the software program, SHEBA. No PAH activity was detected for some mutants. However, the residual activities associated with other mutants ranged over a wide spectrum. The missense mutations responsive to BH(4) were not highly conserved throughout the 43 species in the multiple sequence alignment that encode PAH. The composite model structure of PAH revealed that dimer stability was reduced in the BH(4)-responsive mutants, whereas tetramer stability remained normal. This expression study analyzed PAH mutations and model structures of mutant PAH proteins are proposed. Correlation between the proposed mutant PAH structures and functions are suggested.	0
SHP-2 expression negatively regulates NK cell function. || Blotting, Western Cell Line Cytoplasmic Granules Cytoskeleton Cytotoxicity, Immunologic Gene Knockdown Techniques Gene Silencing Granzymes Humans Interferon-gamma Killer Cells, Natural Lymphocyte Activation Microtubules Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Receptors, KIR Signal Transduction Transduction, Genetic || Src homology region 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) is required for full activation of Ras/ERK in many cytokine and growth factor receptor signaling pathways. In contrast, SHP-2 inhibits activation of human NK cells upon recruitment to killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR). To determine how SHP-2 impacts NK cell activation in KIR-dependent or KIR-independent signaling pathways, we employed knockdown and overexpression strategies in NK-like cell lines and analyzed the consequences on functional responses. In response to stimulation with susceptible target cells, SHP-2-silenced NK cells had elevated cytolytic activity and IFN-gamma production, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type or gain-of-function mutants of SHP-2 exhibited dampened activities. Increased levels of SHP-2 expression over this range significantly suppressed microtubule organizing center polarization and granzyme B release in response to target cells. Interestingly, NK-target cell conjugation was only reduced by overexpressing SHP-2, but not potentiated in SHP-2-silenced cells, indicating that conjugation is not influenced by physiological levels of SHP-2 expression. KIR-dependent inhibition of cytotoxicity was unaffected by significant reductions in SHP-2 levels, presumably because KIR were still capable of recruiting the phosphatase under these limiting conditions. In contrast, the general suppressive effect of SHP-2 on cytotoxicity and cytokine release was much more sensitive to changes in cellular SHP-2 levels. In summary, our studies have identified a new, KIR-independent role for SHP-2 in dampening NK cell activation in response to tumor target cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This suppression of activation impacts microtubule organizing center-based cytoskeletal rearrangement and granule release.	0
A novel TP53 pathway influences the HGS-mediated exosome formation in colorectal cancer. || Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Colorectal Neoplasms Down-Regulation Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport Exosomes Female Gene Knockout Techniques HCT116 Cells Humans Male Phosphoproteins Prognosis Proteome Proteomics RNA Interference Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor-derived exosomes are important for cell-cell communication. However, the role of TP53 in the control of exosome production in colorectal cancer (CRC) is controversial and unclear. The features of exosomes secreted from HCT116 TP53-wild type (WT), TP53-knockout (KO) and constructed TP53 (R273H)-mutant (MT) cells were assessed. The exosomes from the MT and KO cells exhibited significantly reduced sizes compared with the WT cells. A comprehensive proteomic analysis of exosomal proteins was performed using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-2D-LC-MS/MS strategy. A total of 3437 protein groups with ≥2 matched peptides were identified. Specifically, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS) was consistently down-regulated in the exosomes from the MT and KO cells. Functional studies demonstrated that low HGS levels were responsible for the decreased exosome size. TP53 regulated HGS expression and thus HGS-dependent exosome formation. Furthermore, the HGS expression was gradually increased concomitant with CRC carcinogenesis and was an independent poor prognostic factor. In conclusion, a novel HGS-dependent TP53 mechanism in exosome formation was identified in CRC. HGS may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and a candidate target for therapeutic interventions.	0
Attenuated phenotype of Costello syndrome and early death in a patient with an HRAS mutation (c.179G>T; p.Gly60Val) affecting signalling dynamics. || Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Autopsy Cell Line Costello Syndrome Fatal Outcome Genetic Association Studies Genotype Humans Infant Male Mutation Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction || Costello syndrome (CS) is caused by heterozygous germline HRAS mutations. Most patients share the HRAS mutation c.34G>A (p.Gly12Ser) associated with the typical, relatively homogeneous phenotype. Rarer mutations occurred in individuals with an attenuated phenotype. Although many disease-associated HRAS alterations trigger constitutive activation of HRAS-dependent signalling pathways, additional pathological consequences exist. An infant with failure-to-thrive and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had a novel de novo HRAS mutation (c.179G>T; p.Gly60Val). He showed subtle dysmorphic findings consistent with attenuated CS and died from presumed cardiac cause. Functional studies revealed that amino acid change p.Gly60Val impairs HRAS binding to effectors PIK3CA, phospholipase C1, and RAL guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator. In contrast, interaction with effector rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) and regulator NF1 GTPase-activating protein was enhanced. Importantly, expression of HRAS p.Gly60Val in HEK293 cells reduced growth factor sensitivity leading to damped RAF-MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinases-AKT signalling response. Our data support the idea that a variable range of dysregulated HRAS-dependent signalling dynamics, rather than static activation of HRAS-dependent signal flow, may underlie the phenotypic variability in CS.	0
Assessing genotype-phenotype correlation in Costello syndrome using a severity score. || Adolescent Adult Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Costello Syndrome Genetic Association Studies Humans Infant Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || Costello syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with multisystemic involvement, is caused by germline HRAS mutations. Because several different missense mutations have been reported, a severity scoring system was developed to assess a possible genotype-phenotype correlation. Records of 78 individuals with Costello syndrome were scored in early childhood, childhood, and young adulthood by a reviewer blinded to the individuals' specific mutations. These scores were based on certain medically relevant feeding, neurologic, orthopedic, endocrine, cardiac, malignancy, and mortality manifestations. Individuals' severity scores were then grouped by the particular HRAS mutation. The mixed-model approach for repeated-measures analysis of variance with unstructured within-subject correlation, pairwise comparisons, and contrast were used to determine whether the severity scores differed by mutation. Although the sample size was small, individuals with the p.G12A or p.G12C HRAS change were more severely affected than those with other HRAS mutations. Regardless of the mutation, severity did not increase significantly over time. Despite its limitations, including the small number of individuals with rare mutations and possibly incomplete medical records, this work providing the first quantitative assessment of phenotypic severity in a Costello syndrome cohort supports a medically relevant genotype-phenotype correlation.	4
Phenotypic variability in gap junction syndromic skin disorders: experience from KID and Clouston syndromes' clinical diagnostics. || Adult Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Ectodermal Dysplasia Female Gap Junctions Humans Infant Keratitis Male Pedigree Phenotype Poland || Connexins belong to the family of gap junction proteins which enable direct cell-to-cell communication by forming channels in adjacent cells. Mutations in connexin genes cause a variety of human diseases and, in a few cases, result in skin disorders. There are significant differences in the clinical picture of two rare autosomal dominant syndromes: keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome and hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (Clouston syndrome), which are caused by GJB2 and GJB6 mutations, respectively. This is despite the fact that, in both cases, malfunctioning of the same family proteins and some overlapping clinical features (nail dystrophy, hair loss, and palmoplantar keratoderma) is observed. KID syndrome is characterized by progressive vascularizing keratitis, ichthyosiform erythrokeratoderma, and neurosensory hearing loss, whereas Clouston syndrome is characterized by nail dystrophy, hypotrichosis, and palmoplantar keratoderma. The present paper presents a Polish patient with sporadic KID syndrome caused by the mutation of p.Asp50Asn in GJB2. The patient encountered difficulties in obtaining a correct diagnosis. The other case presented is that of a family with Clouston syndrome (caused by p.Gly11Arg mutation in GJB6), who are the first reported patients of Polish origin suffering from this disorder. Phenotype diversity among patients with the same genotypes reported to date is also summarized. The conclusion is that proper diagnosis of these syndromes is still challenging and should always be followed by molecular verification.	4
Analyzing effects of naturally occurring missense mutations. ||  || Single-point mutation in genome, for example, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or rare genetic mutation, is the change of a single nucleotide for another in the genome sequence. Some of them will produce an amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein sequence (missense mutations); others will not. This paper focuses on genetic mutations resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein and how to assess their effects on protein wild-type characteristics. The existing methods and approaches for predicting the effects of mutation on protein stability, structure, and dynamics are outlined and discussed with respect to their underlying principles. Available resources, either as stand-alone applications or webservers, are pointed out as well. It is emphasized that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these effects due to these missense mutations is of critical importance for detecting disease-causing mutations. The paper provides several examples of the application of 3D structure-based methods to model the effects of protein stability and protein-protein interactions caused by missense mutations as well.	0
MEK plus PI3K/mTORC1/2 Therapeutic Efficacy Is Impacted by TP53 Mutation in Preclinical Models of Colorectal Cancer. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Colorectal Neoplasms Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Disease Models, Animal Drug Synergism Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Humans Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 Mice Multiprotein Complexes Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein Kinase Inhibitors Signal Transduction TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays bcl-2-Associated X Protein || PI3K pathway activation occurs in concomitance with RAS/BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer, limiting the sensitivity to targeted therapies. Several clinical studies are being conducted to test the tolerability and clinical activity of dual MEK and PI3K pathway blockade in solid tumors. In the present study, we explored the efficacy of dual pathway blockade in colorectal cancer preclinical models harboring concomitant activation of the ERK and PI3K pathways. Moreover, we investigated if TP53 mutation affects the response to this therapy. Dual MEK and mTORC1/2 blockade resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects in cell lines bearing alterations in KRAS/BRAF and PIK3CA/PTEN. Although the on-treatment cell-cycle effects were not affected by the TP53 status, a marked proapoptotic response to therapy was observed exclusively in wild-type TP53 colorectal cancer models. We further interrogated two independent panels of KRAS/BRAF- and PIK3CA/PTEN-altered cell line- and patient-derived tumor xenografts for the antitumor response toward this combination of agents. A combination response that resulted in substantial antitumor activity was exclusively observed among the wild-type TP53 models (two out of five, 40%), but there was no such response across the eight mutant TP53 models (0%). Interestingly, within a cohort of 14 patients with colorectal cancer treated with these agents for their metastatic disease, two patients with long-lasting responses (32 weeks) had TP53 wild-type tumors. Our data support that, in wild-type TP53 colorectal cancer cells with ERK and PI3K pathway alterations, MEK blockade results in potent p21 induction, preventing apoptosis to occur. In turn, mTORC1/2 inhibition blocks MEK inhibitor-mediated p21 induction, unleashing apoptosis. Clin Cancer Res; 21(24); 5499-510. ©2015 AACR.	0
Pathology supported genetic testing and treatment of cardiovascular disease in middle age for prevention of Alzheimer's disease. || Alzheimer Disease Brain Diseases, Metabolic Cardiovascular Diseases Genetic Testing Humans Middle Aged Risk Factors || Chronic, multi-factorial conditions caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors frequently share common disease mechanisms, as evidenced by an overlap between genetic risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes including ApoE, MTHFR, HFE and FTO are known to increase the risk of both conditions. The E4 allele of the ApoE polymorphism is the most extensively studied risk factor for AD and increases the risk of coronary heart disease by approximately 40%. It furthermore displays differential therapeutic responses with use of cholesterol-lowering statins and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which may also be due to variation in the CYP2D6 gene in some patients. Disease expression may be triggered by gene-environment interaction causing conversion of minor metabolic abnormalities into major brain disease due to cumulative risk. A growing body of evidence supports the assessment and treatment of CVD risk factors in midlife as a preventable cause of cognitive decline, morbidity and mortality in old age. In this review, the concept of pathology supported genetic testing (PSGT) for CVD is described in this context. PSGT combines DNA testing with biochemical measurements to determine gene expression and to monitor response to treatment. The aim is to diagnose treatable disease subtypes of complex disorders, facilitate prevention of cumulative risk and formulate intervention strategies guided from the genetic background. CVD provides a model to address the lifestyle link in most chronic diseases with a genetic component. Similar preventative measures would apply for optimisation of heart and brain health.	4
The clinical significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in a clinic-based metastatic melanoma cohort. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Disease-Free Survival Exons Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genes, ras Humans Indoles Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Sulfonamides Vemurafenib || BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequently found in melanoma tumours, and recently developed BRAF-targeted therapies demonstrate significant clinical benefit. We sought to investigate the clinical significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in a clinic-based metastatic melanoma cohort. In total, 237 tumours, mostly metastatic lesions, from 203 patients were screened for mutations in exon 15 of BRAF and exon 2 of NRAS using Sanger sequencing. BRAF and NRAS mutation status was analysed in relation to clinical and histopathological characteristics, and outcome. Mutation in BRAF and NRAS was present in 43% (88% V600E, 10% V600K) and 30% (48% Q61K, 40% Q61R) of metastatic melanomas, respectively. We found consistent BRAF and NRAS mutation status in all but one of 27 patients with multiple metastases. BRAF mutation was associated with younger age at primary diagnosis (P = 0.02). Among patients with distant metastatic melanoma, patients with BRAF-mutant tumours without BRAF inhibitor treatment had inferior survival compared with patients with BRAF inhibitor treatment [hazard ratio (HR) 2.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-5.01, P = 0.03]. We also observed a trend towards better prognosis for patients with wild-type and NRAS-mutant tumours compared with BRAF V600E-mutant tumours (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39-1.04, P = 0.07; and HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48-1.21, P = 0.25, respectively). We were able to confirm the effect of BRAF inhibitor treatment in a single clinical institution. The results suggest further that BRAF mutation is a weak prognostic factor but a strong predictive factor and that BRAF-mutant melanoma might constitute one or more distinct subtypes of the disease with certain aetiology and clinical outcome.	4
2-Deoxyglucose Suppresses ERK Phosphorylation in LKB1 and Ras Wild-Type Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells. || AMP-Activated Protein Kinases Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Line, Tumor Deoxyglucose Enzyme Activation Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Humans Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Lung Neoplasms Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Phosphorylation Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Tumor cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP, namely the "Warburg" effect. 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) is well characterized as a glycolytic inhibitor, but its effect on cellular signaling pathways has not been fully elucidated. Herein, we sought to investigate the effect of 2-DG on ERK function in lung cancer cells. We found that 2-DG inhibits ERK phosphorylation in a time and dose-dependent manner in lung cancer cells. This inhibition requires functional LKB1. LKB1 knockdown in LKB1 wildtype cells correlated with an increase in the basal level of p-ERK. Restoration of LKB1 in LKB1-null cells significantly inhibits ERK activation. Blocking AMPK function with AMPK inhibitor, AMPK siRNA or DN-AMPK diminishes the inhibitory effect of 2-DG on ERK, suggesting that 2-DG-induced ERK inhibition is mediated by LKB1/AMPK signaling. Moreover, IGF1-induced ERK phosphorylation is significantly decreased by 2-DG. Conversely, a subset of oncogenic mutants of K-Ras, the main upstream regulator of ERK, blocks 2-DG-induced LKB1/AMPK signaling. These findings reveal the potential cross-talk between LKB1/AMPK and ERK signaling and help to better understand the mechanism of action of 2-DG.	0
Improved potency of F10 relative to 5-fluorouracil in colorectal cancer cells with p53 mutations. ||  || Resistance to fluoropyrimidine drugs (FPs) is a major cause of mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC). We assessed the potency advantage of the polymeric FP F10 relative to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in four human CRC cell lines that differ only in TP53 mutational status to determine how p53 mutations affect drug response and whether F10 is likely to improve outcomes. HCT-116 human CRC cells (p53+/+) and three isogenic variants (p53-/-, R248W/+, R248W/-) were assessed for drug response. Resistance factors were derived from cell viability data and used to establish the relative potency advantage for F10. Rescue studies with exogenous uridine/thymidine determined if cytotoxicity resulted from DNA-directed processes. Significant resistance to 5-FU resulted from p53-loss or from gain-of-function (GOF) mutation (R248W) and was greatest when GOF mutation was coupled with loss of wild-type p53. F10 is much more potent than 5-FU (137-314-fold depending on TP53 mutational status). F10 and 5-FU induce apoptosis by DNA- and RNA-directed mechanisms, respectively, and only F10 shows a modest enhancement in cytotoxicity upon co-treatment with leucovorin. TP53 mutational status affects inherent sensitivity to FPs, with p53 GOF mutations most deleterious. F10 is much more effective than 5-FU regardless ofTP53 mutations and has potential to be effective to CRC that is resistant to 5-FU due, in part, toTP53 mutations.6,7.	0
Novel BRAF and KRAS Mutations in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Arising in Struma Ovarii. || Adult Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma Carcinoma, Papillary Female Humans Immunohistochemistry Middle Aged Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Struma Ovarii Thyroid Cancer, Papillary Thyroid Neoplasms Young Adult || Papillary carcinomas of thyroid type rarely arise within struma ovarii. There are limited data on the immunohistochemical and molecular features of these tumors. Three cases of papillary carcinoma arising in struma ovarii (PCSO) were identified. The clinicopathological features were reviewed and immunohistochemical staining for HBME-1, cytokeratin (CK) 19, and CD56 was performed. Tumor DNA was sequenced for somatic mutations using a panel of 26 oncogenes, with a particular focus on BRAF and KRAS mutations. The patients were aged 22, 48, and 55 years. All cases were FIGO stage IA. Two tumors were of classical histological type, and one was a follicular variant papillary carcinoma. All tumors expressed HBME-1 and two were positive for CK19. CD56 was negative in all three cases. One tumor demonstrated a BRAF G469A mutation in exon 11, and in a second case, a KRAS Q61K double base mutation in exon 3 was detected. These mutations have not been described previously in PCSO. No mutations were detected in the benign follicular components of the tumors adjacent to the malignant papillary tissue. None of the patients had tumor recurrence on clinical follow-up (range 11 months to 8½ years). HBME-1, CK19, and CD56 are useful immunohistochemical markers of PCSO. Novel BRAF and KRAS mutations were identified in two of three tumors suggesting that mutations in PCSO may differ from those commonly identified in papillary carcinoma of the eutopic thyroid. The clinical significance of these mutations is uncertain but follow-up data in this small series support the generally good prognosis of PCSO.	4
A chimeric protein PTEN-L-p53 enters U251 cells to repress proliferation and invasion. ||  || PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor, dephosphorylates PIP3 and inhibits AKT activity. A translational variant of PTEN has been identified and termed PTEN-Long (PTEN-L). The additional 173 amino acids (PTEN-L leader) at the N-terminal constitute a potential signal peptide. Differing from canonical PTEN, PTEN-L is secreted into the extracellular fluid and re-enters recipient cells, playing the similar roles as PTEN in vivo and in vitro. This character confers the PTEN-L a therapeutic ability via directly protein delivering instead of traditional DNA and RNA vector options. In the present study, we employed PTEN-L leader to assemble a fusion protein, PTEN-L-p53, inosculated with the transcriptional regulator TP53, which is another powerful tumor suppressor. We overexpressed PTEN-L-p53 in HEK293T cells and detected it in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Subsequently, we found that PTEN-L-p53 was secreted outside of the cells and detected in the culture media by immunoblotting. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PTEN-L-p53 freely entered the cells and suppressed the viability of U251cells (p53R273H, a cell line with p53 R273H-mutation). PTEN-L-p53 is composed of endogenous protein/peptide bearing low immunogenicity, and only the junction region between PTEN-L leader and p53 can act as a new immune epitope. Accordingly, this fusion protein can potentially be used as a therapeutic option for TP53-abnormality cancers.	0
[Identification of mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene using an automated DNA sequencer]. || Automation Base Sequence Codon, Terminator DNA Primers Exons Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Sequence Analysis, DNA || Mutations were studied in phenylalanine hydroxylase gene of phenylketonuria patients from Kemerovo oblast and Altaiskii krai (15 and 2 families, respectively). The following mutations were identified in exons of this gene: R408W, R261Q, R243Q, Y414C, Y386C, P281L, Y168H, R68S (lead to amino acid substitutions), R243X (leads to stop codon formation), and three splice site mutations (IVS12nt 1g-->a, IVS2nt-13t-->g, IVS7nt 1g-->a).	3
Circulating-free DNA Mutation Associated with Response of Targeted Therapy in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer. || Adolescent Adult Aged Antigens, CD Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Cadherins Chromogranins Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Receptor, ErbB-2 Receptor, Notch1 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || The addition of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted drugs, such as trastuzumab, lapatinib, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), to chemotherapy significantly improved prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. However, it was confused that metastatic patients vary in the response of targeted drug. Therefore, methods of accurately predicting drug response were really needed. To overcome the spatial and temporal limitations of biopsies, we aimed to develop a more sensitive and less invasive method of detecting mutations associated with anti-HER2 therapeutic response through circulating-free DNA (cfDNA). From March 6, 2014 to December 10, 2014, 24 plasma samples from 20 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received systemic therapy were eligible. We used a panel for detection of hot-spot mutations from 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and then used targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify somatic mutation of these samples in those 50 genes. Samples taken before their first trastuzumab administration and subsequently proven with clinical benefit were grouped into sensitive group. The others were collected after disease progression of the trastuzumab-based therapy and were grouped into the resistant group. A total of 486 single-nucleotide variants from 46 genes were detected. Of these 46 genes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), proto-oncogene c-Kit (KIT), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) were the most common mutated genes. Seven genes, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), G protein subunit alpha S (GNAS), HRas proto-oncogene (HRAS), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), cadherin 1 (CDH1), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), and NOTCH1, that only occurred m utations in the resistant group were associated with the resistance of targeted therapy. In addition, we detected a HER2 S855I mutation in two patients who had persistent benefits from anti-HER2 therapy. Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential clinical utility to detect biomarkers from HER2-targeted therapies.	4
Comparative study on driver mutations in primary and metastatic melanomas at a single Japanese institute: A clue for intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Japan Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms, Unknown Primary Oncogenes Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Young Adult || Searching for driver mutations in melanoma is critical to understanding melanoma genesis, progression and response to therapy. We aimed to investigate the frequency and pattern of driver mutations in Japanese primary and metastatic melanomas including cases of unknown primary origin, in relation to their clinicopathologic manifestations. Seventy-seven samples from 60 patients with melanoma were screened for 70 driver mutations of 20 oncogenes by Sequenom MelaCarta MassARRAY, and the results for primary and metastatic melanomas were compared. Of 77 tissue samples, BRAF V600E was detected in 21 samples (27%), CDK4 R24C in 7, EPHB6 G404S in 6, BRAF V600K in 2, NEK10 E379K in 2, and CDK4 R24H, NRAS Q61K, NRAS Q61R, KRAS G12A, KIT L576P, KIT V559A, ERBB4 E452K, and PDGFRA E996K in one sample each. No driver mutations related to the MAPK cascade including RAS and BRAF were detected in the chronically sun-damaged (CSD) group of melanoma. Dual or triple driver mutations were found in four of 40 (10%) samples from the primary melanomas, and three of 37 (8%) of the metastatic melanomas. Fourteen of 26 (54%) samples of non-CSD melanoma, and 3 of 6 (50%) melanomas of unknown primary origin had the BRAF V600E mutation. Mutations in membrane-bound receptors including KIT, ERBB4 and EPHB6 were detected in 8 of 77 (10%) samples. Of 17 pairs of primary and metastatic melanomas from the same patient, the primary mutation pattern was changed to a novel one in three cases, and only one of the plural mutations in the primary melanoma was found in the metastatic lesions in two cases. BRAF V600E is a predominant mutation in non-CSD melanoma and melanomas of unknown primary origin. Mutational heterogeneity may exist in the primary melanoma (intra-tumor heterogeneity), and between the primary and metastatic lesions (inter-tumor heterogeneity).	4
Ensemble-based computational approach discriminates functional activity of p53 cancer and rescue mutants. || Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Neoplasms Protein Binding Protein Conformation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumor suppressor protein p53 can lose its function upon single-point missense mutations in the core DNA-binding domain ("cancer mutants"). Activity can be restored by second-site suppressor mutations ("rescue mutants"). This paper relates the functional activity of p53 cancer and rescue mutants to their overall molecular dynamics (MD), without focusing on local structural details. A novel global measure of protein flexibility for the p53 core DNA-binding domain, the number of clusters at a certain RMSD cutoff, was computed by clustering over 0.7 µs of explicitly solvated all-atom MD simulations. For wild-type p53 and a sample of p53 cancer or rescue mutants, the number of clusters was a good predictor of in vivo p53 functional activity in cell-based assays. This number-of-clusters (NOC) metric was strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.77) with reported values of experimentally measured ΔΔG protein thermodynamic stability. Interpreting the number of clusters as a measure of protein flexibility: (i) p53 cancer mutants were more flexible than wild-type protein, (ii) second-site rescue mutations decreased the flexibility of cancer mutants, and (iii) negative controls of non-rescue second-site mutants did not. This new method reflects the overall stability of the p53 core domain and can discriminate which second-site mutations restore activity to p53 cancer mutants.	0
Paraspinal neurofibromas and hypertrophic neuropathy in Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines. || Adolescent Adult Female Humans Hypertrophy LEOPARD Syndrome Male Middle Aged Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutation Neurofibroma Neurofibromatosis 1 Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Spinal Neoplasms || Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterised by lentigines, EKG abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonic stenosis, abnormal genitalia, growth retardation and deafness. There is significant clinical overlap between NSML and other disorders that result from dysregulated rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (RASopathies). Except for neurofibromatosis type 1, other RASopathies are not known to be typically associated with neurogenic tumours. We evaluated patients from three families with pigmentary skin lesions, progressive neuropathy, enlarged nerves, massive burden of paraspinal tumours (neurofibroma was confirmed in one patient) and a clinical diagnosis of NSML. All patients had a mutation in the protein tyrosine phosphatase catalytic domain of the PTPN11 gene; two unrelated patients had the p.Thr468Met mutation, while the family consisting of two affected individuals harboured the p.Thr279Cys mutation. Molecular analysis performed on hypertrophic nerve tissue did not disclose a second somatic hit in NF1, PTPN11, NF2 or SMARCB1 genes. Neurogenic tumours and hypertrophic neuropathy are unusual complications of NSML and may be an under-recognised manifestation that would warrant surveillance. Our observation may also have implications for other disorders caused by RAS-pathway dysregulation.	4
Exome sequencing identifies variants in two genes encoding the LIM-proteins NRAP and FHL1 in an Italian patient with BAG3 myofibrillar myopathy. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Adult Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Exome Female Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Italy LIM Domain Proteins Muscle Proteins Myopathies, Structural, Congenital Transfection || Myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs) are genetically heterogeneous dystrophies characterized by the disintegration of Z-disks and myofibrils and are associated with mutations in genes encoding Z-disk or Z-disk-related proteins. The c.626 C > T (p.P209L) mutation in the BAG3 gene has been described as causative of a subtype of MFM. We report a sporadic case of a 26-year-old Italian woman, affected by MFM with axonal neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, rigid spine, who carries the c.626 C > T mutation in the BAG3 gene. The patient and her non-consanguineous healthy parents and brother were studied with whole exome sequencing (WES) to further investigate the genetic basis of this complex phenotype. In the patient, we found that the BAG3 mutation is associated with variants in the NRAP and FHL1 genes that encode muscle-specific, LIM domain containing proteins. Quantitative real time PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of the patient's muscular biopsy showed the absence of NRAP expression and FHL1 accumulation in aggregates in the affected skeletal muscle tissue. Molecular dynamic analysis of the mutated FHL1 domain showed a modification in its surface charge, which could affect its capability to bind its target proteins. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting, in a BAG3 MFM, the simultaneous presence of genetic variants in the BAG3 and FHL1 genes (previously described as independently associated with MFMs) and linking the NRAP gene to MFM for the first time.	4
p53 Maintains Baseline Expression of Multiple Tumor Suppressor Genes. || Binding Sites Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Forkhead Box Protein O1 Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Haploinsufficiency Histone Demethylases Humans MicroRNAs Mutation Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins PTEN Phosphohydrolase Protein Binding Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || TP53 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene and its mutation drives tumorigenesis. Using ChIP-seq for p53 in the absence of acute cell stress, we found that wild-type but not mutant p53 binds and activates numerous tumor suppressor genes, includingPTEN, STK11(LKB1), miR-34a, KDM6A(UTX), FOXO1, PHLDA3, andTNFRSF10B through consensus binding sites in enhancers and promoters. Depletion of p53 reduced expression of these target genes, and analysis across 18 tumor types showed that mutation ofTP53 associated with reduced expression of many of these genes. Regarding PTEN, p53 activated expression of a luciferase reporter gene containing the p53-consensus site in thePTEN enhancer, and homozygous deletion of this region in cells decreased PTEN expression and increased growth and transformation. These findings show that p53 maintains expression of a team of tumor suppressor genes that may together with the stress-induced targets mediate the ability of p53 to suppress cancer development. p53 mutations selected during tumor initiation and progression, thus, inactivate multiple tumor suppressor genes in parallel, which could account for the high frequency of p53 mutations in cancer.Implications: In this study, we investigate the activities of p53 under normal low-stress conditions and discover that p53 is capable of maintaining the expression of a group of important tumor suppressor genes at baseline, many of which are haploinsufficient, which could contribute to p53-mediated tumor suppression.Mol Cancer Res; 15(8); 1051-62. ©2017 AACR.	0
Phenylketonuria: variable phenotypic outcomes of the R261Q mutation and maternal PKU in the offspring of a healthy homozygote. || Adult Child Female Haplotypes Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Maternal-Fetal Exchange Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Pregnancy Pregnancy Complications || Phenylketonuria (PKU) and benign hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) result from a variety of mutations in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. PKU has been found in the Israeli population in two variants, classical and atypical. The two are clinically indistinguishable and require treatment with low phenylalanine diet to prevent mental retardation, but show differences in serum phenylalanine levels and in tolerance to this amino acid. Maternal PKU is a syndrome of congenital anomalies and mental retardation that appears in offspring of PKU mothers as a result of fetal exposure to the high phenylalanine level in the maternal blood. We studied a family in which two children with severe, classical PKU and their unaffected brother showed mild signs of maternal PKU. Their mother had no clinical signs of PKU, but the phenylalanine concentration in her serum reached a level that usually characterises PKU patients. This woman represents a rare phenotype, benign atypical PKU. Such 'hidden' PKU in women may lead to maternal PKU in the offspring, similar to overt PKU. Special attention should therefore be paid to women having children with any of the clinical hallmarks of maternal PKU, and to children born to women known to have benign HPA. The mother was also found to be homozygous for a missense mutation at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus, R261Q, which does not abolish enzymatic activity completely. In two other families, homozygosity for this mutation resulted in atypical PKU in four children. This observation suggests that mutations that do not completely destroy phenylalanine hydroxylase activity may exhibit variable phenotypic expression which is unpredictable. Compound heterozygosity for R261Q and other mutations led in other patients either to classical PKU or to mild benign HPA.	1 3
Overexpressed somatic alleles are enriched in functional elements in Breast Cancer. || Alleles Breast Neoplasms Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genetic Variation Genotype Humans Mutation Response Elements Transcriptome || Asymmetric allele content in the transcriptome can be indicative of functional and selective features of the underlying genetic variants. Yet, imbalanced alleles, especially from diploid genome regions, are poorly explored in cancer. Here we systematically quantify and integrate the variant allele fraction from corresponding RNA and DNA sequence data from patients with breast cancer acquired through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We test for correlation between allele prevalence and functionality in known cancer-implicated genes from the Cancer Gene Census (CGC). We document significant allele-preferential expression of functional variants in CGC genes and across the entire dataset. Notably, we find frequent allele-specific overexpression of variants in tumor-suppressor genes. We also report a list of over-expressed variants from non-CGC genes. Overall, our analysis presents an integrated set of features of somatic allele expression and points to the vast information content of the asymmetric alleles in the cancer transcriptome.	4
Sudden hearing loss in a family with GJB2 related progressive deafness. || Adult Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Disease Progression Female Greece Hearing Loss, Sudden Homozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Young Adult || Mutations of GJB2, the gene encoding connexin 26, have been associated with prelingual, sensorineural hearing loss of mild to profound severity. One specific mutation, the 35delG, has accounted for the majority of mutations detected in the GJB2 gene in Caucasian populations. Recent studies have described progression of hearing loss in a proportion of cases with GJB2 deafness. We report an unusual family with four 35delG homozygous members, in which the parents were deaf-mute whilst both children had a postlingual progressive hearing loss. Furthermore, the son suffered from sudden hearing loss.	4
High frequency of GJB2 gene mutations in Polish patients with prelingual nonsyndromic deafness. || Adolescent Age of Onset Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Child Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genotype Humans Male Mutation Mutation, Missense Poland Prevalence Sequence Deletion || We report an analysis of 102 unrelated Polish patients with profound prelingual deafness for mutations in the GJB2 gene (OMIM #220290). Mutations were found in 41/102 (40%) subjects. Among mutated alleles, 35delG was prevalent and present in 88%. In nine alleles, different mutations were found: M34T, Q47X, R184P, and 313del14 (found in 6 patients). The results prove mutations in the GJB2 gene are responsible for much hereditary nonsyndromic deafness in Poland, with a strong prevalence of the 35delG mutation. We have also found a high carrier frequency (1/50) for the 35delG mutation in the Polish population.	4
Landscape of somatic mutations in different subtypes of advanced breast cancer with circulating tumor DNA analysis. || Adult Breast Neoplasms Circulating Tumor DNA DNA Copy Number Variations DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genome, Human Humans Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Neoplasm Staging Point Mutation || It is particularly important to provide precise therapies and understand tumor heterogeneity based on the molecular typing of mutational landscape. However, the landscape of somatic mutations in different subtypes of advanced breast cancer (ABC) is largely unknown. We applied target-region capture deep sequencing to determine the frequency and spectrum of common cancer-related gene mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) among different ABC subtypes and analyze their association with clinical features. In this retrospective study of 100 female advanced breast cancer patients, 96 (96.0%) had somatic genomic alterations in ctDNA, including copy number variants and point mutations. The results revealed that different subtypes of ABC have distinct features in terms of genetic alterations. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that the number of somatic mutations increased with the line of endocrine therapy and the fractions of trunk mutations was positive associated with the line of target therapy.	4

Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Pakistani breast and ovarian cancer patients. || Adult Aged BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Breast Neoplasms, Male DNA Mutational Analysis Family Health Female Founder Effect Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Geography Germ-Line Mutation Haplotypes Humans Male Middle Aged Ovarian Neoplasms Pakistan Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Prevalence || Among Asian countries, Pakistan has the highest rates of breast and ovarian cancer. To assess the contribution of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ line mutations to these high rates, we conducted the first study of 176 Pakistani breast and ovarian cancer patients, selected on family history and on age of diagnosis. Comprehensive BRCA mutation screening was performed using a range of techniques, including denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and protein truncation test, followed by DNA sequencing. Thirty deleterious germ-line mutations were identified in the 176 families (17.0%), including 23 in BRCA1 and 7 in BRCA2. Four mutations, 185delAG, 185insA, S1503X and R1835X, were recurrent; these accounted for 52% of all identified BRCA1 mutations. Haplotype analyses suggested founder effects for 3 of these. The prevalence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations was 42.8% for families with multiple cases of breast cancer, and was 50.0% for the breast/ovarian cancer families. The prevalence of mutations was 11.9% for single cases of early-onset breast cancer (< or =30 years) and was 9.0% for single cases of early-onset ovarian cancer (< or =45 years). Our findings show that BRCA mutations account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer and early-onset breast and ovarian cancer cases in Pakistan.	4
'Celtic' phenylketonuria chromosomes found? Evidence in two regions of Quebec Province. ||  || We analyzed mutations, RFLP haplotypes (H), and a VNTR polymorphism at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus (PAH) in 12 French-Canadian patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) from the eastern region of Quebec province and 13 non-French-Canadian PKU patients from the Montreal region. There were 10 different mutation/H/VNTR haplotype combinations on the 50 PKU chromosomes: one set of 5 and another of 8 accounted for 88 and 77% of these chromosomes in the French-Canadian and non-French-Canadian patients, respectively. The differences in PKU haplotypes between the two groups of probands reflect the different histories of the two populations. Three PKU haplotype combinations were shared by the two groups: IVS12nt1:H-3:VNTR-8, I65T:H-9:VNTR-8, and R408W:H-1:VNTR-8. The IVS12nt1 mutation (18% of the total sample) is prevalent in northern Europeans. The I65T-H-9 and R408W:H-1 haplotypes have seldom been reported in Europeans but when encountered tend to be found in northwestern regions. The R408W mutation is usually on H-2 in Europeans. In Quebec the R408W:H-1 and I65T:H-9 haplotypes accounted for 20% of PKU chromosomes, clustered in two geographic regions, and in every family where they occurred an Irish or Scottish ('Celtic') ancestor could be inferred. We propose that I65T:H-9:VNTR-8 and R408W:H-1:VNTR-8 chromosomes are markers for a diaspora of 'Celtic' descendants. Our findings predict the distributions of these unusual PKU haplotypes in contemporary Europeans.	3
Origins of hyperphenylalaninemia in Israel. ||  || Mutations and polymorphisms at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene were used to study the genetic diversity of the Jewish and Palestinian Arab populations in Israel. PAH mutations are responsible for a large variety of hyperphenylalaninemias (HPAs), ranging from the autosomal recessive disease phenylketonuria to various degrees of nonclinical HPA. Seventy-two Jewish and 36 Palestinian Arab families with various HPAs, containing 115 affected genotypes, were studied by haplotype analysis, screening for previously known PAH lesions and a search for novel mutations. Forty-one PAH haplotypes were observed in this sample. Four mutations previously identified in Europe (IVS10nt546, R261Q, R408W and R158Q) were found, and were associated with the same haplotypes as in Europe, indicating possible gene flow from European populations into the Jewish and Palestinian gene pools. Of particular interest is a PAH allele with the IVS10nt546 mutation and haplotype 6, that might have originated in Italy more than 3,000 years ago and spread during the expansion of the Roman Empire. These results, together with previous identification of three PAH mutations unique to Palestinian Arabs [IVSnt2, Edel(197-205) and R270S], indicate that the relatively high genetic diversity of the Jewish and Palestinian populations reflects, in addition to genetic events unique to these communities, some gene flow from neighboring and conquering populations.	1 3
T cell neoepitope discovery in colorectal cancer by high throughput profiling of somatic mutations in expressed genes. || Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes Cell Cycle Proteins Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Complementary Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte F-Box Proteins F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7 Gene Expression HLA Antigens High-Throughput Screening Assays Humans Neoplastic Stem Cells Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Smad4 Protein Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases || Patient-specific (unique) tumour antigens, encoded by somatically mutated cancer genes, generate neoepitopes that are implicated in the induction of tumour-controlling T cell responses. Recent advancements in massive DNA sequencing combined with robust T cell epitope predictions have allowed their systematic identification in several malignancies. We undertook the identification of unique neoepitopes in colorectal cancers (CRCs) by using high-throughput sequencing of cDNAs expressed by standard cancer cell cultures, and by related cancer stem/initiating cells (CSCs) cultures, coupled with a reverse immunology approach not requiring human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele-specific epitope predictions. Several unique mutated antigens of CRC, shared by standard cancer and related CSC cultures, were identified by this strategy. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, either autologous to the patient or derived from HLA-matched healthy donors, were readily expanded in vitro by peptides spanning different cancer mutations and specifically recognised differentiated cancer cells and CSC cultures, expressing the mutations. Neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cell frequency was also increased in a patient, compared with healthy donors, supporting the occurrence of clonal expansion in vivo. These results provide a proof-of-concept approach for the identification of unique neoepitopes that are immunogenic in patients with CRC and can also target T cells against the most aggressive CSC component.	0
PALB2 mutations in BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast and ovarian cancer patients from Poland. || Adult BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Case-Control Studies Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Female Genetic Testing Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Middle Aged Nuclear Proteins Ovarian Neoplasms Poland Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The PALB2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic integrity. Germline inactivating mutations in PALB2 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The prevalence and spectrum of recurrent PALB2 germline mutations in breast and ovarian cancer patients from Poland is not clearly defined. PALB2 exons were amplified from 460 BRCA1/2-mutation negative women with familial breast and/or ovarian cancer and early-onset breast cancer using AmpliSeq technology and sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. In addition, eight selected variants were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 807 BRCA1/2-mutation negative breast cancer patients and 1690 healthy women. Two recurrent PALB2 mutations, c.172_175delTTGT and c.509_510delGA, were identified, along with one novel mutation, c.347insT. In total, PALB2 pathogenic mutations were detected in 7/460 (1.5%) patients. Furthermore, in breast and/or ovarian cancer patients, several single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were detected in the PALB2 coding region. In an additional group of 807 patients, eight (1%) carriers of two pathogenic mutations, c.172_175delTTGT (0.5%) and c.509_510delGA (0.5%), were identified. The c.509_510delGA mutation was not identified in healthy controls, while c.172_175delTTGT was identified in 4/1690 (0.24%) of control women. Germline mutations in the PALB2 gene were observed at a frequency of approximately 1.5% in Polish breast and/or ovarian cancer patients. Our study confirms two recurrent PALB2 mutations; c.172_175delGA and c.509_510delGA.	4

However, the relevance of germline variants in other genes from multigene hereditary cancer testing panels is not well defined. To determine the risks of breast cancer associated with germline variants in cancer predisposition genes. A study population of 65 057 patients with breast cancer receiving germline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes with hereditary cancer multigene panels. Associations between pathogenic variants in non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 predisposition genes and breast cancer risk were estimated in a case-control analysis of patients with breast cancer and Exome Aggregation Consortium reference controls. The women underwent testing between March 15, 2012, and June 30, 2016. Breast cancer risk conferred by pathogenic variants in non-BRCA1 and non-BRCA2 predisposition genes. The mean (SD) age at diagnosis for the 65 057 women included in the analysis was 48.5 (11.1) years. The frequency of pathogenic variants in 21 panel genes identified in 41 611 consecutively tested white women with breast cancer was estimated at 10.2%. After exclusion of BRCA1, BRCA2, and syndromic breast cancer genes (CDH1, PTEN, and TP53), observed pathogenic variants in 5 of 16 genes were associated with high or moderately increased risks of breast cancer: ATM (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.22-3.62), BARD1 (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.31-3.63), CHEK2 (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.31-1.67), PALB2 (OR, 7.46; 95% CI, 5.12-11.19), and RAD51D (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.21-7.88). Conversely, variants in the BRIP1 and RAD51C ovarian cancer risk genes; the MRE11A, RAD50, and NBN MRN complex genes; the MLH1 and PMS2 mismatch repair genes; and NF1 were not associated with increased risks of breast cancer. This study establishes several panel genes as high- and moderate-risk breast cancer genes and provides estimates of breast cancer risk associated with pathogenic variants in these genes among individuals qualifying for clinical genetic testing.	4
The degree of intratumor mutational heterogeneity varies by primary tumor sub-site. || Adult Carcinoma, Squamous Cell DNA Copy Number Variations Female Genetic Heterogeneity Head and Neck Neoplasms High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Laryngeal Neoplasms Loss of Heterozygosity Male Middle Aged Mouth Neoplasms Mutation Tongue Neoplasms || In an era where mutational profiles inform treatment options, it is critical to know the extent to which tumor biopsies represent the molecular profile of the primary and metastatic tumor. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) arise primarily in the mucosal lining of oral cavity and oropharynx. Despite aggressive therapy the 5-year survival rate is at 50%. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the degree of intratumor mutational heterogeneity in HNSCC. We used multi-region sequencing of paired primary and metastatic tumor DNA of 24 spatially distinct samples from seven patients with HNSCC of larynx, floor of the mouth (FOM) or oral tongue. Full length, in-depth sequencing of 202 genes implicated in cancer was carried out. Larynx and FOM tumors had more than 69.2% unique SNVs between the paired primary and metastatic lesions. In contrast, the oral tongue HNSCC had only 33.3% unique SNVs across multiple sites. In addition, HNSCC of the oral tongue had fewer mutations than larynx and FOM tumors. These findings were validated on the Affymetrix whole genome 6.0 array platform and were consistent with data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This is the first report demonstrating differences in mutational heterogeneity varying by subsite in HNSCC. The heterogeneity within laryngeal tumor specimens may lead to an underestimation of the genetic abnormalities within tumors and may foster resistance to standard treatment protocols. These findings are relevant to investigators and clinicians developing personalized cancer treatments based on identification of specific mutations in tumor biopsies.	4

Overweight condition and waist circumference and a candidate gene within the 12q24 locus. || Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Linkage Genetic Loci Humans Italy Male Overweight Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Waist Circumference || Obesity and obesity-associated phenotypes are linked to the chromosome12q24 locus, the non-insulin-dependent-diabetes 2 (NIDDM2) locus. The gene of proteasome modulator 9 (PSMD9) lies in the NIDDM2 region and is linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D), microvascular and macrovascular complications of T2D.We aimed at studying whether the PSMD9 T2D risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) IVS3+nt460, IVS3+nt437, and 197G are linked to obesity, overweight status and waist circumference in Italian T2D families. We screened 200 Italians T2D siblings/families for PSMD9 variants. Using Merlin software, we performed non-parametric linkage analysis to test for linkage with obesity and overweight condition and variance component analysis to test for linkage with waist circumference in our T2D siblings/families dataset.Our study shows that the PSMD9 SNPs IVS3+nt460, IVS3+nt437, and 197G are in linkage with overweight condition and waist circumference in Italians. The statistical power tests performed via simulations on real data confirm that the results are not due to random chance. In summary, the linkage strategy using a homogeneous family/subject dataset can identify a gene contributing to a complex trait. PMSD9 may be at least one of the genes responsible for the linkage to obesity and obesity-associated phenotypes at the locus 12q24 in other populations.	4
Structural studies of N-terminal mutants of Connexin 26 and Connexin 32 using (1)H NMR spectroscopy. || Animals Calcium Connexins Gap Junctions Humans Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Mutation Oocytes Peptides Protein Domains Static Electricity Temperature Xenopus || Alterations in gap junctions underlie the etiologies of syndromic deafness (KID) and Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMTX). Functional gap junctions are composed of connexin molecules with N-termini containing a flexible turn around G12, inserting the N-termini into the channel pore allowing voltage gating. The loss of this turn correlates with loss of Connexin 32 (Cx32) function by impaired trafficking to the cell membrane. Using (1)H NMR we show the N-terminus of a syndromic deafness mutation Cx26G12R, producing "leaky channels", contains a turn around G12 which is less structured and more flexible than wild-type. In contrast, the N-terminal structure of the same mutation in Cx32 chimera, Cx32*43E1G12R shows a larger constricted turn and no membrane current expression but forms membrane inserted hemichannels. Their function was rescued by formation of heteromeric channels with wild type subunits. We suggest the inflexible Cx32G12R N-terminus blocks ion conduction in homomeric channels and this channel block is relieved by incorporation of wild type subunits. In contrast, the increased open probability of Cx26G12R hemichannels is likely due to the addition of positive charge in the channel pore changing pore electrostatics and impairing hemichannel regulation by Ca(2+). These results provide mechanistic information on aberrant channel activity observed in disease.	0
Prospective Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Lung Adenocarcinomas for Efficient Patient Matching to Approved and Emerging Therapies. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Adolescent Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Female Genetic Testing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Young Adult || Tumor genetic testing is standard of care for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, but the fraction of patients who derive clinical benefit remains undefined. Here, we report the experience of 860 patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma analyzed prospectively for mutations in >300 cancer-associated genes. Potentially actionable genetic events were stratified into one of four levels based upon published clinical or laboratory evidence that the mutation in question confers increased sensitivity to standard or investigational therapies. Overall, 37.1% (319/860) of patients received a matched therapy guided by their tumor molecular profile. Excluding alterations associated with standard-of-care therapy, 14.4% (69/478) received matched therapy, with a clinical benefit of 52%. Use of matched therapy was strongly influenced by the level of preexistent clinical evidence that the mutation identified predicts for drug response. Analysis of genes mutated significantly more often in tumors without known actionable mutations nominated STK11 andKEAP1 as possible targetable mitogenic drivers.Significance: An increasing number of therapies that target molecular alterations required for tumor maintenance and progression have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The data reported here suggest that broader, early testing for molecular alterations that have not yet been recognized as standard-of-care predictive biomarkers of drug response could accelerate the development of targeted agents for rare mutational events and could result in improved clinical outcomes.Cancer Discov; 7(6); 596-609. ©2017 AACR.See related commentary by Liu et al., p. 555This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 539.	4
[Preimplantaion genetic diagnosis of hearing loss with 35delG mutation in GJB2 gene - preliminary report]. || Connexin 30 Connexins Female Fertilization in Vitro Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Pregnancy Pregnancy Outcome Preimplantation Diagnosis || 35delG mutation in GJB2 gene is the most frequent mutation in genetic hearing loss. The carrier screening for 35delG mutation to identify affected newborns is at the moment relatively inexpensive method for deafness diagnosis. The casual treatment of DFNB1 is impossible. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a method allowing transfer mutation free embryos and successful pregnancies. It's an established procedure allowing genetic research of the oocyte before fertilization or embryo before implantation to the uterus. The aim of the present work was to perform PGD for GJB2 35delG mutation in a couple who had already a child affected with genetic hearing loss. The patient underwent a standard IVF procedure associated with intracytoplasmic sperm injection. 6–8 cell embryos were biopsied on day 3. Single cell nested PCR-RFLP protocol and sequence analysis for PGD was used for the detection of GJB2 35delG mutation. In the course of IVF-PGD procedures, from 6 analyzed embryos 3 were predicted to be free of GJB2 35delG mutation in both alleles. Two embryos were heterozygous and one was affected for this mutation as homozygous mutation in both alleles. Of these, one healthy embryo was transferred, resulting in an unaffected singleton pregnancy. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of monogenic disorders is a very efficient method, especially for patients whose previous child is homozygous for genetic disorders. It offers new possibilities for the treatment for genetic disease carriers.	4
Malignant mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: fact or fancy? || Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Death, Sudden, Cardiac Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a relatively common genetic disease, generally with a benign prognosis. However sudden cardiac death may occur, sometimes as the first manifestation of the disease. More than two hundred different mutations have been described in HCM, in 12 different genes encoding sarcomere proteins. This genetic diversity is accompanied by considerable clinical variability and it is likely that phenotype is partially determined by genotype. In recent years it has been suggested that genetic defects could be the major markers of prognosis. Thus, some mutations would carry a good prognosis whereas others, so-called 'malignant' mutations, would be associated with premature sudden death. In a Portuguese population of 35 index patients with HCM the authors found considerable genetic heterogeneity: seven of the 12 mutations identified were de novo, each family having its own 'private' mutation. Moreover, in two unrelated families with the same mutation (I263T--exon 9, missense) in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7), penetrance, clinical expression and prognosis were quite different, particularly regarding the occurrence of sudden cardiac death. In two other also unrelated families, in each index patient a different mutation was identified in the troponin I gene (TNNI3): A157V (missense), exon 7 and S199N (missense), exon 8. Phenotypic expression was different but both patients suffered sudden cardiac death (one survived). This suggests that mutations in this gene carry an adverse prognosis. In conclusion, the considerable genetic and clinical variability found in HCM hinders the interpretation of genotype-phenotype correlations, particularly since all the published data is based on small numbers of families.	4
Involvement of p53 in the cytotoxic activity of the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 in myeloid leukemic cells. || Acetylation Acrylamides Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cytokines Gene Knockout Techniques Humans Leukemia, Myeloid NAD Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Piperidines Sirtuins Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation bcl-2-Associated X Protein || FK866 is a specific inhibitor of NAMPT and induces apoptosis of leukemic cells by depletion of intracellular NAD(+). Since up-regulation of NAMPT is associated with several cases of cancers, including leukemias, we asked whether in leukemic cells inhibition of NAMPT involves p53 pathway. We observed that FK866 induced apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation in NB-4, OCI-AML3 and MOLM-13 cell lines. In contrast, the leukemia cell lines, K-562 and Kasumi, containing nonfunctional p53 were relatively unaffected by FK866 treatment. Importantly, direct inhibition of sirtuins significantly reduced the viability of NB-4, OCI-AML3 and MOLM-13 cell lines. Activation of p53 by FK866 involved increased acetylation of p53 at lysine 382 with subsequent increase in the expression of p21 and BAX. Further, knockdown of p53 attenuated the effects of FK866 on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, which was partly associated with decreased expression of p21 and BAX. Our results suggest the role of p53 acetylation pathway in the anti-leukemic effect of FK866.	0
Coexpression of NRASQ61R and BRAFV600E in human melanoma cells activates senescence and increases susceptibility to cell-mediated cytotoxicity. || Alleles Antigen Presentation Cell Line, Tumor Cellular Senescence Cytotoxicity, Immunologic Doxycycline Enzyme Activation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Histocompatibility Antigens Class I Humans Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mutation Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic || Activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS oncogenes in human melanomas are mutually exclusive. This finding has suggested an epistatic relationship but is consistent even with synthetic lethality. To evaluate the latter possibility, a mutated NRAS(Q61R) oncogene was expressed, under a constitutive or a doxycycline-regulated promoter, in a metastatic melanoma clone (clone 21) harboring an activated BRAF(V600E) oncogene. After the first 10 to 12 in vitro passages, the constitutive NRAS(Q61R) transfectant displayed progressive accumulation in G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle and stained for the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity (SA-beta-Gal). Inducible expression of NRAS(Q61R), by the Tet-Off system, in clone 21 cells (21NRAS(61ON)) led to overactivation of the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and, after the 10th in vitro passage, led to promotion of senescence. This was documented by reduced proliferation, flattened cell morphology, reduced growth in Matrigel, positive staining for SA-beta-Gal, and expression of AMP-activated protein kinase and of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(waf1/Cip1). These effects were detected neither in 21 cells with silenced NRAS(Q61R) (21NRAS(61OFF)) nor in cells transfected with an inducible wild-type NRAS gene (21NRAS(WTON)). In addition, when compared with parental 21 cells, or with 21NRAS(61OFF), 21NRAS(61ON) and constitutive NRAS(Q61R) transfectants cells showed increased susceptibility to cytotoxicity by both HLA class I antigen-restricted and nonspecific T cells and up-regulation of several MHC class I antigen processing machinery components. These results suggest a relationship of synthetic lethality between NRAS and BRAF oncogenes, leading to selection against "double-mutant" cells.	0

We evaluated whether circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis is comparable to molecular profiling of myeloma using bone-marrow tumour cells. We report here a hybrid-capture-based Liquid Biopsy Sequencing (LB-Seq) method used to sequence all protein-coding exons of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR and PIK3CA in 64 cfDNA specimens from 53 myeloma patients to >20,000 × median coverage. This method includes a variant filtering algorithm that enables detection of tumour-derived fragments present in cfDNA at allele frequencies as low as 0.25% (median 3.2%, range 0.25-46%). Using LB-Seq analysis of 48 cfDNA specimens with matched bone-marrow data, we detect 49/51 likely somatic mutations, with subclonal hierarchies reflecting tumour profiling (96% concordance), and four additional mutations likely missed by bone-marrow testing (>98% specificity). Overall, LB-Seq is a high fidelity adjunct to genetic profiling of bone-marrow in multiple myeloma.	4

We find that lamellipodia-like protrusions and retrograde actin flow are indeed observed in cells moving in 3D ECM. However, Rab-coupling protein (RCP)-driven endocytic recycling of α5β1 integrin enhances invasive migration of cancer cells into fibronectin-rich 3D ECM, driven by RhoA and filopodial spike-based protrusions, not lamellipodia. Furthermore, we show that actin spike protrusions are Arp2/3-independent. Dynamic actin spike assembly in cells invading in vitro and in vivo is regulated by Formin homology-2 domain containing 3 (FHOD3), which is activated by RhoA/ROCK, establishing a novel mechanism through which the RCP-α5β1 pathway reprograms the actin cytoskeleton to promote invasive migration and local invasion in vivo.	0
Comparative analysis of primary versus relapse/refractory DLBCL identifies shifts in mutation spectrum. ||  || Current understanding of the mutation spectrum of relapsed/refractory (RR) tumors is limited. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 47 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors that persisted after R-CHOP treatment, 8 matched to primary biopsies. We compared genomic alterations from the RR cohort against two treatment-naïve DLBCL cohorts (n=112). While the overall number and types of mutations did not differ significantly, we identified frequency changes in DLBCL driver genes. The overall frequency of MYD88 mutant samples increased (12% to 19%), but we noted a decrease in p.L265P (8% to 4%) and increase in p.S219C mutations (2% to 6%).CARD11 p.D230N,PIM1 p.K115N andCD79B p.Y196C mutations were not observed in the RR cohort, although these mutations were prominent in the primary DLBCL samples. We observed an increase inBCL2 mutations (21% to 38% of samples),BCL2 amplifications (3% to 6% of samples) andCREBBP mutations (31% to 42% of samples) in the RR cohort, supported by acquisition of mutations in these genes in relapsed compared to diagnostic biopsies from the same patient. These increases may reflect the genetic characteristics of R-CHOP RR tumors expected to be enriched for during clinical trial enrollment. These findings hold significance for a number of emerging targeted therapies aligned to genetic targets and biomarkers in DLBCL, reinforcing the importance of time-of-treatment biomarker screening during DLBCL therapy selection.	4
BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. ||  || BRAF is a proto-oncogene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase which promotes cell proliferation and survival. BRAF mutations are commonly seen in melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinicopathological features of BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases submitted for routine mutation testing at our institution. Mutation analysis for BRAF, EGFR and KRAS was performed using Sequenom MassARRAY platform with OncoCarta panel v1.0. Pathological features were reviewed and immunohistochemistry for BRAF V600E was also performed. Seven out of 273 cases (2.6%) had BRAF mutations (three males and four females, median age 70 years, all smokers), with six adenocarcinomas and one NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS). All had wild-type EGFR and KRAS. The identified BRAF mutations were V600E (4/7, 58%), K601N, L597Q and G469V. BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry was positive in two cases with V600E and negative in one case with K601N (tissue available in three cases only). No significant difference in age or gender was found (BRAF mutant vs. wild-type). BRAF mutations occur in a small proportion of NSCLC that lack other driver mutations. The clinicopathological profile differs from that of EGFR mutant tumours. The potential benefits of BRAF-inhibitors should be investigated.	4
Sequence-based detection of mutations in cadherin 1 to determine the prevalence of germline mutations in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. ||  || Loss of cadherin 1 (CDH1) expression, which is normally involved in cell adhesion and maintenance of tissue architecture, is a hallmark of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILCA). Because hereditary cancers may require different risk reduction, counseling and treatment options than sporadic cancer, it is critical to determine the prevalence of germline CDH1 mutations in patients with ILCA. All patients with ILCA (n = 100) previously enrolled in the Clinical Breast Care Project were identified. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples and DNA variants were detected for each exon of CDH1 using high-resolution melting technology followed by direct sequencing. Within the 100 samples screened, four nonsynonymous variants were detected: A592T in one Hispanic patient, A617T in two patients, both African American, P825L in a Causasian patient whose grandmother had stomach cancer, and G879S in a Caucasian patient. Further evaluation of A617T in an additional 165 African American patients found that 11 patients, none with ILCA, carried this variant including one patient who was homozygous for the variant. CDH1 mutations are infrequent in patients with ILCA, and the variants that were detected have been classified as non-pathogenic. These data suggest that ILCA does not have a significant hereditary component and do not support CDH1 gene mutation testing in patients with ILCA.	4

Hence, there is an increasing need for a robust and high-throughput technology to detect oncogenic hotspot mutations. Although commercial assays are available to detect genetic alterations in single genes, only a limited amount of tissue is often available from patients, requiring multiplexing to allow for simultaneous detection of mutations in many genes using low DNA input. Even though next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms provide powerful tools for this purpose, they face challenges such as high cost, large DNA input requirement, complex data analysis, and long turnaround times, limiting their use in clinical settings. We report the development of the next generation mutation multi-analyte panel (MUT-MAP), a high-throughput microfluidic, panel for detecting 120 somatic mutations across eleven genes of therapeutic interest (AKT1, BRAF, EGFR, FGFR3, FLT3, HRAS, KIT, KRAS, MET, NRAS, and PIK3CA) using allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and Taqman technology. This mutation panel requires as little as 2 ng of high quality DNA from fresh frozen or 100 ng of DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Mutation calls, including an automated data analysis process, have been implemented to run 88 samples per day. Validation of this platform using plasmids showed robust signal and low cross-reactivity in all of the newly added assays and mutation calls in cell line samples were found to be consistent with the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database allowing for direct comparison of our platform to Sanger sequencing. High correlation with NGS when compared to the SuraSeq500 panel run on the Ion Torrent platform in a FFPE dilution experiment showed assay sensitivity down to 0.45%. This multiplexed mutation panel is a valuable tool for high-throughput biomarker discovery in personalized medicine and cancer drug development.	4
p53 mutations change phosphatidylinositol acyl chain composition. || Cell Line Fatty Acids High-Throughput Screening Assays Humans Lipid Metabolism Mutation PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates Phosphorylation Second Messenger Systems Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) second messengers relay extracellular growth cues through the phosphorylation status of the inositol sugar, a signal transduction system that is deregulated in cancer. In stark contrast to PIP inositol head-group phosphorylation, changes in phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipid acyl chains in cancer have remained ill-defined. Here, we apply a mass-spectrometry-based method capable of unbiased high-throughput identification and quantification of cellular PI acyl chain composition. Using this approach, we find that PI lipid chains represent a cell-specific fingerprint and are unperturbed by serum-mediated signaling in contrast to the inositol head group. We find that mutation of Trp53 results in PIs containing reduced-length fatty acid moieties. Our results suggest that the anchoring tails of lipid second messengers form an additional layer of PIP signaling in cancer that operates independently of PTEN/PI3-kinase activity but is instead linked to p53.	0
Alpha crystallins in the retinal pigment epithelium and implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of age-related macular degeneration. || Animals Humans Macular Degeneration Molecular Chaperones Oxidative Stress Peptides Retinal Pigment Epithelium alpha-Crystallins || αA- and αB crystallins are principal members of the small heat shock protein family and elicit both a cell protective function and a chaperone function. α-Crystallins have been found to be prominent proteins in normal and pathological retina emphasizing the importance for in-depth understanding of their function and significance. Retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) play a vital role in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This review addresses a number of cellular functions mediated by α-crystallins in the retina. Prominent expression of αB crystallin in mitochondria may serve to protect cells from oxidative injury. αB crystallin as secretory protein via exosomes can offer neuroprotection to adjacent RPE cells and photoreceptors. The availability of chaperone-containing minipeptides of αB crystallin could prove to be a valuable new tool for therapeutic treatment of retinal disorders. α-Crystallins are expressed in cytosol and mitochondria of RPE cells and are regulated during oxygen-induced retinopathy and during development. α-Crystallins protect RPE from oxidative-and ER stress-induced injury and autophagy. αB-Crystallin is a modulator of angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor. αB Crystallin is secreted via exosomal pathway. Minichaperone peptides derived from αB Crystallin prevent oxidant induced cell death and have therapeutic potential. Overall, this review summarizes several novel properties of α-crystallins and their relevance to maintaining normal retinal function. In particular, the use of α-crystallin derived peptides is a promising therapeutic strategy to combat retinal diseases such as AMD. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Crystallin biochemistry in health and disease.	0
Predictors of mother and child DNA yields in buccal cell samples collected in pediatric cancer epidemiologic studies: a report from the Children's Oncology group. || Adult Child, Preschool DNA Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mothers Mouth Mucosa Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Specimen Handling || Collection of high-quality DNA is essential for molecular epidemiology studies. Methods have been evaluated for optimal DNA collection in studies of adults; however, DNA collection in young children poses additional challenges. Here, we have evaluated predictors of DNA quantity in buccal cells collected for population-based studies of infant leukemia (N = 489 mothers and 392 children) and hepatoblastoma (HB; N = 446 mothers and 412 children) conducted through the Children's Oncology Group. DNA samples were collected by mail using mouthwash (for mothers and some children) and buccal brush (for children) collection kits and quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. Multivariable linear regression models were used to identify predictors of DNA yield. Median DNA yield was higher for mothers in both studies compared with their children (14 μg vs. <1 μg). Significant predictors of DNA yield in children included case-control status (β = -0.69, 50% reduction, P = 0.01 for case vs. control children), brush collection type, and season of sample collection. Demographic factors were not strong predictors of DNA yield in mothers or children in this analysis. The association with seasonality suggests that conditions during transport may influence DNA yield. The low yields observed in most children in these studies highlight the importance of developing alternative methods for DNA collection in younger age groups.	4
BRAF mutations in papillary carcinomas of the thyroid. || Carcinoma, Papillary Humans Mutation Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Thyroid Neoplasms Thyrotropin ras Proteins || BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that receives a mitogenic signal from RAS and transmits it to the MAP kinase pathway. Recent studies have reported that mutations of the BRAF gene were detected with varying frequencies in several cancers, notably more than 60% in melanoma. We analysed mutations of BRAF and RAS genes in 100 cases of thyroid carcinoma to investigate genetic aberrations in the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAP kinase pathway. BRAF mutations were detected exclusively in papillary carcinomas (40 in 76 cases: 53%), and were exclusively V599E, a mutation frequently observed in other carcinomas. NRAS mutation was observed in six cases (6%), all in histological types other than papillary carcinoma, and was exclusively Q61R. No mutations were found in KRAS or HRAS. Our results suggest that BRAF mutations may play a critical role in the carcinogenesis of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.	4
Effects of temperature on the p53-DNA binding interactions and their dynamical behavior: comparing the wild type to the R248Q mutant. || Base Sequence DNA Humans Hydrogen Bonding Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutant Proteins Mutation Nucleic Acid Conformation Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Temperature Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Water || The protein p53 plays an active role in the regulation of cell cycle. In about half of human cancers, the protein is inactivated by mutations located primarily in its DNA-binding domain. Interestingly, a number of these mutations possess temperature-induced DNA-binding characteristics. A striking example is the mutation of Arg248 into glutamine or tryptophan. These mutants are defective for binding to DNA at 310 K although they have been shown to bind specifically to several p53 response elements at sub-physiological temperatures (298-306 K). This important experimental finding motivated us to examine the effects of temperature on the structure and configuration of R248Q mutant and compare it to the wild type protein. Our aim is to determine how and where structural changes of mutant variants take place due to temperature changes. To answer these questions, we compared the mutant to the wild-type proteins from two different aspects. First, we investigated the systems at the atomistic level through their DNA-binding affinity, hydrogen bond networks and spatial distribution of water molecules. Next, we assessed changes in their long-lived conformational motions at the coarse-grained level through the collective dynamics of their side-chain and backbone atoms separately. The experimentally observed effect of temperature on the DNA-binding properties of p53 is reproduced. Analysis of atomistic and coarse-grained data reveal that changes in binding are determined by a few key residues and provide a rationale for the mutant-loss of binding at physiological temperatures. The findings can potentially enable a rescue strategy for the mutant structure.	0
A novel isoform of the 8p22 tumor suppressor gene DLC1 suppresses tumor growth and is frequently silenced in multiple common tumors. || Base Sequence Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8 DNA Methylation DNA Primers GTPase-Activating Proteins Gene Silencing Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Molecular Sequence Data Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The critical 8p22 tumor suppressor deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) is frequently inactivated by aberrant CpG methylation and/or genetic deletion and implicated in tumorigeneses of multiple tumor types. Here, we report the identification and characterization of its new isoform, DLC1 isoform 4 (DLC1-i4). This novel isoform encodes an 1125-aa (amino acid) protein with distinct N-terminus as compared with other known DLC1 isoforms. Similar to other isoforms, DLC1-i4 is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues and immortalized normal epithelial cells, suggesting a role as a major DLC1 transcript. However, differential expression of the four DLC1 isoforms is found in tumor cell lines: Isoform 1 (longest) and 3 (short thus probably nonfunctional) share a promoter and are silenced in almost all cancer and immortalized cell lines, whereas isoform 2 and 4 utilize different promoters and are frequently downregulated. DLC1-i4 is significantly downregulated in multiple carcinoma cell lines, including 2/4 nasopharyngeal, 8/16 (50%) esophageal, 4/16 (25%) gastric, 6/9 (67%) breast, 3/4 colorectal, 4/4 cervical and 2/8(25%) lung carcinoma cell lines. The functional DLC1-i4 promoter is within a CpG island and is activated by wild-type p53. CpG methylation of the DLC1-i4 promoter is associated with its silencing in tumor cells and was detected in 38-100% of multiple primary tumors. Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or genetic double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B led to demethylation of the promoter and reactivation of its expression, indicating a predominantly epigenetic mechanism of silencing. Ectopic expression of DLC1-i4 in silenced tumor cells strongly inhibited their growth and colony formation. Thus, we identified a new isoform of DLC1 with tumor suppressive function. The differential expression of various DLC1 isoforms suggests interplay in modulating the complex activities of DLC1 during carcinogenesis.	0
PALB2: research reaching to clinical outcomes for women with breast cancer. ||  || PALB2 has taken its place with bona fide breast cancer susceptibility genes. It is now well established that women who carry loss-of-function mutations in the PALB2 gene are at similarly elevated breast cancer risks to those who carry mutations in BRCA2. Information about PALB2 is now being used in breast cancer clinical genetics practice and is routinely included in breast cancer predisposition gene panel tests. Tens of thousands of women worldwide have now had genetic tests for PALB2 mutations in the context of breast cancer susceptibility. However, prospective data related to the clinical outcomes of PALB2 mutation carriers is lacking and very little information (beyond mutation penetrance) is available to guide current clinical management for carriers (affected and unaffected by cancer). In addition, clinical classification of the vast array of non-loss-of-function genetic variants identified in PALB2 is in its infancy. These are key areas of current research efforts and are important foundations on which to move information about PALB2 into the precision public health arena.	4
Experimental and Theoretical Evaluation of the Ethynyl Moiety as a Halogen Bioisostere. || Acetylene Alkynes Binding Sites Computer Simulation Crystallography, X-Ray Halogens Isomerism Ligands Models, Chemical Molecular Structure Mutation Phenols Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Bioisosteric replacements are widely used in medicinal chemistry to improve physicochemical and ADME properties of molecules while retaining or improving affinity. Here, using the p53 cancer mutant Y220C as a test case, we investigate both computationally and experimentally whether an ethynyl moiety is a suitable bioisostere to replace iodine in ligands that form halogen bonds with the protein backbone. This bioisosteric transformation is synthetically feasible via Sonogashira cross-coupling. In our test case of a particularly strong halogen bond, replacement of the iodine with an ethynyl group resulted in a 13-fold affinity loss. High-resolution crystal structures of the two analogues in complex with the p53-Y220C mutant enabled us to correlate the different affinities with particular features of the binding site and subtle changes in ligand binding mode. In addition, using QM calculations and analyzing the PDB, we provide general guidelines for identifying cases where such a transformation is likely to improve ligand recognition.	0
Quercetin induces mitochondrial mediated apoptosis and protective autophagy in human glioblastoma U373MG cells. || Apoptosis Autophagy Brain Neoplasms Cell Count Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Chloroquine G1 Phase Glioblastoma Humans Immunoblotting Mitochondria Neoplasm Proteins Quercetin || Quercetin is a dietary flavonoid with known antitumor effects against several types of cancers by promoting apoptotic cell death and inducing cell cycle arrest. However, U373MG malignant glioma cells expressing mutant p53 are resistant to a 24 h quercetin treatment. In this study, the anticancer effect of quercetin was reevaluated in U373MG cells, and quercetin was found to be significantly effective in inhibiting proliferation of U373MG cells in a concentration-dependent manner after 48 and 72 h of incubation. Quercetin induced U373MG cell death through apoptosis, as evidenced by the increased number of cells in the sub-G1 phase, the appearance of fragmented nuclei, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7, an increase in caspase-3 and 9 activities, and degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protein. Furthermore, quercetin activated JNK and increased the expression of p53, which translocated to the mitochondria and simultaneously led to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol. We also found that quercetin induced autophagy. Pretreatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, strongly augmented apoptosis in U373MG cells, indicating that quercetin induced protective autopagy in U373MG cells.	0
Phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutation R408W is present on 84% of Estonian phenylketonuria chromosomes. ||  || Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is the enzyme which converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. In case of its deficiency, hyperphenylalaninemia is observed, which leads to phenylketonuria (PKU), a disease causing mental retardation, unless treated with a low-phenylalanine diet since early childhood. In Estonia, PKU is among the most common inherited metabolic diseases. The data from retrospective study and newborn screening show an approximate incidence of 1 in 6,000 newborns. Molecular analysis of 34 Estonian patients has revealed high genotypic homogeneity in this group, as 84% of the mutant alleles carry the R408W mutation. The high rate of this mutation in the Estonian population rises the speculation of Finno-Ugric contribution to the East European pool of mutant PAH alleles. Five more mutations-IVS12nt1, R261Q, R252W, R158Q, S349P-have been detected. The mutation detection rate was 92% among the studied patients.	1 3
Anderson-Fabry disease in heart failure. ||  || Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene that result in deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. The worldwide incidence of Fabry's disease is reported to be in the range of 1 in 40,000-117,000, although this value may be a significant underestimate given under recognition of symptoms and delayed or missed diagnosis. Deficiency in alpha-galactosidase A causes an accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in lysosomes within various tissues including the vascular endothelium, kidneys, heart, eyes, skin and nervous system. Gb3 accumulation induces pathology via the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth-promoting factors and by oxidative stress, resulting in myocardial extracellular matrix remodelling, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), vascular dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac involvement manifesting as ventricular hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, valvular abnormalities and conduction tissue disease is common in AFD and is associated with considerable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality from heart failure, sudden cardiac death and stroke-related death.	3
p.[G576S; E689K]: pathogenic combination or polymorphism in Pompe disease? || Adolescent Adult Cells, Cultured Child Female Fibroblasts Glycogen Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Homozygote Humans Leukocytes Lymphocytes Male Muscles Polymorphism, Genetic alpha-Glucosidases || We discuss four cases of acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency (EC, 3.2.1.3/20) without evident symptoms of Pompe disease (OMIM No 232300) in individuals of Asian descent. In three cases, the deficiency was associated with homozygosity for the sequence variant c.[1726G>A; 2065G>A] in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene (GAA) translating into p.[G576S; E689K]. One of these cases was a patient with profound muscular atrophy, another had cardio-myopathy and the third had no symptoms. The fourth case, the mother of a child with Pompe disease, was compound heterozygote for the GAA sequence variants c.[1726G>A; 2065G>A]/c.2338G>A (p.W746X) and had no symptoms either. Further investigations revealed that c.[1726A; 2065A] is a common GAA allele in the Japanese and Chinese populations. Our limited study predicts that approximately 4% of individuals in these populations are homozygote c.[1726A; 2065A]. The height of this figure in contrast to the rarity of Pompe disease in Asian populations and the clinical history of the cases described in this paper virtually exclude that homozygosity for c.[1726A; 2065A] causes Pompe disease. As c.[1726A; 2065A] homozygotes have been observed with similarly low acid alpha-glucosidase activity as some patients with Pompe disease, we caution they may present as false positives in newborn screening programs especially in Asian populations.	1
Homozygosity for the common GAA gene splice site mutation c.-32-13T>G in Pompe disease is associated with the classical adult phenotypical spectrum. || Adult Disease Progression Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Homozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal Mutation Phenotype RNA Splice Sites alpha-Glucosidases || Homozygosity for the common Caucasian splice site mutation c.-32-13T>G in intron 1 of the GAA gene is rather rare in Pompe patients. We report on the clinical, biochemical, morphological, muscle imaging, and genetic findings of six adult Pompe patients from five unrelated families with the c.-32-13T>G GAA gene mutation in homozygous state. All patients had decreased GAA activity and elevated creatine kinase levels. Five patients, aged between 43 and 61 years (median 53 years), initially presented with myalgia, hyperCKaemia, and/or exercise induced fatigue at an age of onset (12-55 years). All but one had proximal lower limb weakness combined with axial weakness and moderate respiratory insufficiency; the sixth patient presented with hyperCKaemia only. Muscle biopsies showed PAS-positive vacuolar myopathy with lysosomal changes and reduced GAA activity. Muscle MRI of lower limb muscles revealed a moderate adipose substitution of the gluteal muscles, biceps femoris and slight fatty infiltration of all thigh muscles. One MRI of the respiratory muscles revealed a diaphragmatic atrophy with unilateral diaphragm elevation. So, the common Caucasian, so called mild, splice site mutation c.-32-13T>G in intron 1 of the GAA gene in a homozygote status reflects the full adult Pompe disease phenotype severity spectrum.	1
Determining the role of missense mutations in the POU domain of HNF1A that reduce the DNA-binding affinity: A computational approach. || Amino Acid Sequence Binding Sites DNA Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Humans Hydrogen Bonding Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions Molecular Docking Simulation Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation, Missense Principal Component Analysis Protein Binding Protein Domains Protein Stability Recombinant Proteins Static Electricity || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is a non-ketotic form of diabetes associated with poor insulin secretion. Over the past years, several studies have reported the association of missense mutations in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Alpha (HNF1A) with MODY3. Missense mutations in the POU homeodomain (POUH) of HNF1A hinder binding to the DNA, thereby leading to a dysfunctional protein. Missense mutations of the HNF1A were retrieved from public databases and subjected to a three-step computational mutational analysis to identify the underlying mechanism. First, the pathogenicity and stability of the mutations were analyzed to determine whether they alter protein structure and function. Second, the sequence conservation and DNA-binding sites of the mutant positions were assessed; as HNF1A protein is a transcription factor. Finally, the biochemical properties of the biological system were validated using molecular dynamic simulations in Gromacs 4.6.3 package. Two arginine residues (131 and 203) in the HNF1A protein are highly conserved residues and contribute to the function of the protein. Furthermore, the R131W, R131Q, and R203C mutations were predicted to be highly deleterious by in silico tools and showed lower binding affinity with DNA when compared to the native protein using the molecular docking analysis. Triplicate runs of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations (50ns) revealed smaller changes in patterns of deviation, fluctuation, and compactness, in complexes containing the R131Q and R131W mutations, compared to complexes containing the R203C mutant complex. We observed reduction in the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, compactness, and electrostatic potential, as well as the loss of salt bridges, in the R203C mutant complex. Substitution of arginine with cysteine at position 203 decreases the affinity of the protein for DNA, thereby destabilizing the protein. Based on our current findings, the MD approach is an important tool for elucidating the impact and affinity of mutations in DNA-protein interactions and understanding their function.	0
BACH1 Promotes Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma through Antagonizing the Function of p53. || Animals Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors DNA Modification Methylases DNA Repair Enzymes Dacarbazine Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glioblastoma Humans Mice Mice, Inbred NOD Mice, SCID Temozolomide Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The acquisition of drug resistance is a persistent clinical problem limiting the successful treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). However, the molecular mechanisms by which initially chemoresponsive tumors develop therapeutic resistance remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that BACH1, a heme-binding protein that participates in transcriptional repression or activation, was significantly upregulated in glioblastoma tissues. Overexpression of BACH1 in GBM cells conferred resistance to temozolomide, whereas its inhibition markedly sensitized resistant cells to temozolomide in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation revealed that BACH1 activation significantly enhanced the expression of MGMT, and depletion of p53 disrupted the effects of BACH1 on MGMT and temozolomide resistance. P53 sequesters SP1 to prevent its binding to the MGMT promoter region and thus inhibits MGMT expression. Moreover, BACH1 overexpression impaired the association between p53 and SP1 via competitive binding p53, and antagonized the impact of p53 on MGMT expression. Finally, we found that BACH1 low expression correlated with better prognosis in GBM patients undergoing temozolomide therapy, especially in patients with wild-type TP53. Collectively, our findings identify a potential mechanism by which wild-type TP53 GBM cells develop resistance to temozolomide and suggest that targeting this pathway may be beneficial for overcoming resistance.	0
Lung cancer mutation testing: a clinical retesting study of agreement between a real-time PCR and a mass spectrometry test. ||  || To investigate the clinical validity and utility of tests for detecting Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene mutations in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients, tumour DNA extracts from 532 patients previously tested by the cobas EGFR Mutation Test (RT-PCR test) were retested by the Sequenom/Agena Biosciences MassArray OncoFocus mass spectrometry test (MS test). Valid results from both tests were available from 470 patients (88%) for agreement analysis. Survival data were obtained for 513 patients (96%) and 77 patients (14%) were treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Agreement analysis revealed moderately high positive (79.8%), negative (96.9%) and overall percentage agreement (93.2%) for the detection ofEGFR mutations. However,EGFR mutations were detected by one test and not by the other test in 32 patients (7%). Retesting of discordant samples revealed false-positive and false-negative results generated by both tests. Despite this, treatment and survival outcomes correlated with the results of the RT-PCR and MS tests. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of the clinical validity and utility of the RT-PCR and MS tests for detection ofEGFR mutations that predict prognosis and benefit from EGFR-TKI treatment. However, their false-positive and false-negative test results may have important clinical consequences.	4
Evidence in Latin America of recurrence of V388M, a phenylketonuria mutation with high in vitro residual activity. ||  || Phenylketonuria mutation V388M is frequent in the Iberian Peninsula. In vitro, the V388M mutant enzyme has similar immunoreactive protein and phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA and has 43% residual activity, which correlates well with the mild phenotype exhibited by the homozygous patients. In Spain it has been detected in 5.7% of the mutant alleles and is always associated with haplotype 1.7. This mutation is also present in high frequency in some Latin American countries (Brazil, 9%; Chile, 13%). It is interesting that in Chile most of the alleles bearing this mutation carry haplotype 4.3, although in Brazil it is found only on the background of haplotype 1.7. The origin of V388M in Spain on haplotype 1.7 and in Chile on haplotype 4.3 is clearly different. Recurrence is the most plausible explanation, because the mutation involves a CpG dinucleotide, and a recombination event transferring the mutation from haplotype 1 to 4 is unlikely.	1 3
Structural studies of p53 inactivation by DNA-contact mutations and its rescue by suppressor mutations via alternative protein-DNA interactions. || Crystallography, X-Ray DNA Humans Models, Molecular Mutation Nucleic Acid Conformation Protein Structure, Tertiary Suppression, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || A p53 hot-spot mutation found frequently in human cancer is the replacement of R273 by histidine or cysteine residues resulting in p53 loss of function as a tumor suppressor. These mutants can be reactivated by the incorporation of second-site suppressor mutations. Here, we present high-resolution crystal structures of the p53 core domains of the cancer-related proteins, the rescued proteins and their complexes with DNA. The structures show that inactivation of p53 results from the incapacity of the mutated residues to form stabilizing interactions with the DNA backbone, and that reactivation is achieved through alternative interactions formed by the suppressor mutations. Detailed structural and computational analysis demonstrates that the rescued p53 complexes are not fully restored in terms of DNA structure and its interface with p53. Contrary to our previously studied wild-type (wt) p53-DNA complexes showing non-canonical Hoogsteen A/T base pairs of the DNA helix that lead to local minor-groove narrowing and enhanced electrostatic interactions with p53, the current structures display Watson-Crick base pairs associated with direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with p53 at the minor groove. These findings highlight the pivotal role played by R273 residues in supporting the unique geometry of the DNA target and its sequence-specific complex with p53.	0
The predictive value of ERCC1 and p53 for the effect of panobinostat and cisplatin combination treatment in NSCLC. || Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Apoptosis Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin DNA-Binding Proteins Endonucleases Humans Hydroxamic Acids Indoles Lung Neoplasms Panobinostat Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cisplatin is one of the most common chemotherapeutic drugs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response rate is limited because of drug resistance. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which can alter DNA accessibility by regulating chromatin structure and inducing apoptosis, exhibit a synergistic action with cisplatin. However, no biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of the combination of HDACis and cisplatin have been reported. Our study found that panobinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, increased the cisplatin sensitivity of several NSCLC cell lines with low ERCC1 expression but not those with high ERCC1 expression or gain-of-function (GOF) p53 mutation despite of ERCC1 expression level. ERCC1 knockdown increased the cisplatin sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines with high ERCC1 expression without GOF p53 mutations. In addition, in low ERCC1 expression NSCLC cell lines, knockdown of GOF mutant p53 enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Further double knockdown of ERCC1 and GOF mutant p53 but not ERCC1 knockdown alone increased the cisplatin sensitivity of cells with both high ERCC1 expression and GOF p53 mutations. Therefore, this study demonstrated that ERCC1 expression combined with p53 mutation status may determine the efficacy of cisplatin and HDACi combined therapy and guide the development of future NSCLC therapies.	0
Long-term treatment of phenylketonuria with a new medical food containing large neutral amino acids. || Adolescent Amino Acids, Neutral Female Food, Formulated Food, Fortified Humans Male Patient Compliance Phenylalanine Phenylketonurias Treatment Outcome || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deficient activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase. A low phenylalanine (Phe) diet is used to treat PKU. The diet is very restrictive, and dietary adherence tends to decrease as patients get older. Methods to improve dietary adherence and blood Phe control are continuously under investigation. A new formula Phe-neutral amino acid (PheLNAA) has been tested in this study with the purpose of improving the compliance and lowering blood phenylalanine. The formula has been tested for nitrogen balance, and it is nutritionally complete. It is fortified with more nutritional additives that can be deficient in the PKU diet, such as B12, Biotin, DHA, Lutein and increased levels of large neutral amino acids to help lower blood Phe. The new formula has been tested on 12 patients with a loading test of 4 weeks. Fifty-eight percent of patients had a significant decline in blood Phe concentration from baseline throughout the study. The PheLNAA was well tolerated with excellent compliance and without illnesses during the study. In conclusion, the new formula is suitable for life-long treatment of PKU, and it offers the PKU clinic a new choice for treatment.	1 3
Genetic background of hyperphenylalaninemia in Nagasaki, Japan. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Background Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Japan Male Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Young Adult || Phenylketonuria (PKU) and related hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) are caused by a deficiency in hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The incidence of PKU in Nagasaki prefecture is higher than that in all parts of Japan (1/15 894 vs 1/120 000). To investigate the genetic background of patients with HPA in Nagasaki prefecture, mutation analysis was done in 14 patients with PKU or mild HPA. Homozygous or compound heterozygous PAH mutations were identified in all the patients. The spectrum of PAH mutations in the cohort was broad and similar to those in all parts of Japan and East Asian countries. R53H is the most common mutation in patients with mild HPA. The present results provide further support for genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with HPA. The high incidence of PKU in Nagasaki, the westernmost part of Japan, might be due to migration of people with PAH mutations from China and Korea, and geographic factors.	1 3
Curcumin promotes apoptosis by activating the p53-miR-192-5p/215-XIAP pathway in non-small cell lung cancer. || Animals Apoptosis Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Curcumin Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Nude MicroRNAs Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein || Curcumin has attracted increasing interest as an anti-cancer drug for decades. The mechanisms of action involve multiple cancer-related signaling pathways. Recent studies highlighted curcumin has epigenetic regulatory effects on miRNA in cancers. In the present study, we demonstrated the proapoptotic effects of curcumin in vitro and in vivo. miRNA microarray and qPCR indicated that miR-192-5p and miR-215 were the most responsive miRNAs upon curcumin treatment in H460 and A427 cells. Functional studies showed miR-192-5p/215 were putative tumor suppressors in non-small cell lung cancer. Curcumin also promoted miR-192-5p/215 expressions in A549 cells (p53 wild type) but not in H1299 cells (p53-null). Conditional knockdown of p53 by tetracycline inducible expression system significantly abrogated curcumin-induced miR-192-5p/215 upregulation in the p53 wild-type H460, A427 and A549 cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of exogenous wild-type but not R273H mutant p53 in the p53-null H1299 cells enabled miR-192-5p/215 response to curcumin treatment. The proapoptotic effects of curcumin also depended on miR-192-5p/215 induction, and antagonizing miR-192-5p/215 expression attenuated curcumin-induced apoptosis in H460, A427 and A549 cells, but not in H1299 cells. Finally, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) is proved to be a novel transcriptional target of miR-192-5p/215. Taken together, this study highlights that the proapoptotic effects of curcumin depend on miR-192-5p/215 induction and the p53-miR-192-5p/215-XIAP pathway is an important therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancer.	0
Analysis of mitochondrial alterations in Brazilian patients with sensorineural hearing loss using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. || Brazil Case-Control Studies DNA, Mitochondrial Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mitochondria Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2 RNA, Transfer, Lys Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization || Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness in different populations. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of mutations in mitochondrial genes to the etiology of hearing loss in a Brazilian sample. Using mass spectrometry genotyping technology, combined with direct sequencing, 50 alterations previously described in 14 mitochondrial genes were screened in 152 patients with sensorineural hearing loss and in104 normal hearing controls. Fifteen known mitochondrial alterations were detected (G709A, A735G, A827G, G988A, A1555G, T4363C, T5628C, T5655C, G5821A, C7462T, G8363A, T10454C, G12236A, T1291C, G15927A). Pathogenic mutations in MT-RNR1 and MT-TK genes were detected in 3 % (5/152) of the patients with hearing loss. This study contributed to show the spectrum of mitochondrial variants in Brazilian patients with hearing loss. Frequency of A1555G was relatively high (2.6 %), indicating that this mutation is an important cause of hearing loss in our population. This work reports for the first time the investigation and the detection of the tRNA(Lys) G8363A mutation in Brazilian patients with maternally inherited sensorineural hearing loss.	4

Comparative genomic analysis reveals bilateral breast cancers are genetically independent. || Adult Breast Neoplasms Comparative Genomic Hybridization DNA Copy Number Variations DNA Mutational Analysis Female Follow-Up Studies Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Grading Neoplasm Staging Prognosis RNA, Messenger Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Retrospective Studies Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction || Bilateral breast cancer (BBC) poses a major challenge for oncologists because of the cryptic relationship between the two lesions. The purpose of this study was to determine the origin of the contralateral breast cancer (either dependent or independent of the index tumor). Here, we used ultra-deep whole-exome sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to study four paired samples of BBCs with different tumor subtypes and time intervals between the developments of each tumor. We used two paired primary breast tumors and corresponding metastatic liver lesions as the control. We tested the origin independent nature of BBC in three ways: mutational concordance, mutational signature clustering, and clonality analysis using copy number profiles. We found that the paired BBC samples had near-zero concordant mutation rates, which were much lower than those of the paired primary/metastasis samples. The results of a mutational signature analysis also suggested that BBCs are independent of one another. A clonality analysis using aCGH data further revealed that paired BBC samples was clonally independent, in contrast to clonal related origin found for paired primary/metastasis samples. Our preliminary findings show that BBCs in Han Chinese women are origin independent and thus should be treated separately.	4
A Role for p53 in the Adaptation to Glutamine Starvation through the Expression of SLC1A3. ||  || Numerous mechanisms to support cells under conditions of transient nutrient starvation have been described. Several functions of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 can contribute to the adaptation of cells to metabolic stress and help cancer cell survival under nutrient-limiting conditions. We show here that p53 promotes the expression of SLC1A3, an aspartate/glutamate transporter that allows the utilization of aspartate to support cells in the absence of extracellular glutamine. Under glutamine deprivation, SLC1A3 expression maintains electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, promoting de novo glutamate, glutamine, and nucleotide synthesis to rescue cell viability. Tumor cells with high levels of SLC1A3 expression are resistant to glutamine starvation, and SLC1A3 depletion retards the growth of these cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a therapeutic potential for SLC1A3 inhibition.	0
CXCR4 pathway associated with family history of melanoma. || Adult Biomarkers, Tumor Female Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis RNA, Messenger Receptors, CXCR4 Up-Regulation || Genetic predisposition plays a major role in the etiology of melanoma, but known genetic markers only account for a limited fraction of family-history-associated melanoma cases. Expression microarrays have offered the opportunity to identify further genomic profiles correlated with family history of melanoma. We aimed to distinguish mRNA expression signatures between melanoma cases with and without a family history of melanoma. Based on the Nurses' Health Study, family history was defined as having one or more first-degree family members diagnosed with melanoma. Melanoma diagnosis was confirmed by reviewing pathology reports, and tumor blocks were collected by mail from across the USA. Genomic interrogation was accomplished through evaluating expression profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 78 primary cutaneous invasive melanoma cases, on either a 6K or whole-genome (24K) Illumina gene chip. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for each batch to determine the differentially enriched pathways and key contributing genes. The CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) pathway was consistently up-regulated within cases of familial melanoma in both platforms. Leading edge analysis showed four genes from the CXCR4 pathway, including MAPK1, PLCG1, CRK, and PTK2, were among the core members that contributed to the enrichment of this pathway. There was no association between the enrichment of CXCR4 pathway and NRAS, BRAF mutation, or Breslow thickness of the primary melanoma cases. We found that the CXCR4 pathway might constitute a novel susceptibility pathway associated with family history of melanoma in first-degree relatives.	4
Homomeric and heteromeric interactions between wild-type and mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase subunits: evaluation of two-hybrid approaches for functional analysis of mutations causing hyperphenylalaninemia. || Alleles Biopterin DNA, Complementary Dihydropteridine Reductase Dimerization Genes, Reporter Heterozygote Humans Hydro-Lyases Mutation Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Plasmids Protein Binding Protein Biosynthesis Protein Structure, Tertiary Transcription, Genetic Two-Hybrid System Techniques || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH), while mutations in genes encoding the two enzymes (dihydropteridine reductase, DHPR, and pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, PCD) required for recycling of its cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), cause other rarer disease forms of hyperphenylalaninemia. We have applied a yeast two-hybrid method, in which protein--protein interactions are measured by four reporter gene constructs, to the analysis of six PKU-associated PAH missense mutations (F39L, K42I, L48S, I65T, A104D, and R157N). By studying homomeric interactions between mutant PAH subunits, we show that this system is capable of detecting quite subtle aberrations in PAH oligomerization caused by missense mutations and that the observed results generally correlate with the severity of the mutation as determined by other expression systems. The mutant PAH subunits are also shown in this system to be able to interact with wild-type PAH subunits, pointing to an explanation for apparent dominant negative effects previously observed in obligate heterozygotes for PKU mutations. Based on our findings, the applications and limitations of two-hybrid approaches in understanding mechanisms by which PAH missense mutations exert their pathogenic effects are discussed. We have also used this technique to demonstrate homomeric interactions between wild-type DHPR subunits and between wild-type PCD subunits. These data provide a basis for functional studies on HPA-associated mutations affecting these enzymes.	3
Determination of the carrier frequencies of selected GJB2 mutations in the Korean population. || Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Republic of Korea Surveys and Questionnaires || Mutations in the GJB2 gene are a major cause of hereditary hearing loss. However, only a few studies have investigated carrier frequencies of GJB2 mutations in the general population. The aim of this study was to estimate the carrier frequencies of three GJB2 mutations, including 235delC, V37I, and G45E, in the general Korean population. A standard questionnaire of self-reported hearing loss was used to identify and recruit subjects. Screening for three mutations was performed using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and direct DNA sequencing. A total of 1256 unrelated healthy individuals were analysed in the present study. Of the 1256 individuals, 24 had GJB2 mutations; 11 were found to be heterozygous for 235delC, 11 were heterozygous and one was homozygous for V37I, and one was heterozygous for G45E. One individual had a compound heterozygous mutation of 235delC/V37I. The allele frequencies of 235delC, V37I, and G45E mutations were 0.44%, 0.52%, and 0.04%, respectively. The carrier frequency of either the 235delC or V37I mutation was estimated to be 0.88% with 95% binomial CI, 0.44-1.56. These results will facilitate diagnosis of, and genetic counseling for, hearing loss in Koreans.	4
Evaluation of the combined effect of p53 codon 72 polymorphism and hotspot mutations in response to anticancer drugs. || Antineoplastic Agents Base Sequence Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Cisplatin Codon DNA-Binding Proteins Deoxycytidine Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Drug Synergism Etoposide Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Mutation, Missense Nuclear Proteins Paclitaxel Plasmids Polymorphism, Genetic Transfection Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins Vinblastine || Mutations in p53 are common events during carcinogenesis and have been suggested to affect sensitivity to chemotherapy. Recently, the common polymorphism at codon 72, resulting in either an arginine (72R) or proline (72P) residue, was shown to differentially affect the response to anticancer drugs. Here, we have generated isogenic lung cancer cell lines to evaluate the effect of six p53 hotspot mutations (R175H, G245S, R248W, R249S, R273H, and R282W) in conjunction with the codon 72 polymorphism, for their response to a variety of anticancer drugs, either alone or in combination. The data indicate that 72R mutations do not confer general resistance to cisplatin, etoposide, gemcitabine, vinblastine, and taxol. For doxorubicin, cells expressing 249-72R were more resistant than the 249-72P cells. Combined treatment with cisplatin + etoposide resulted in an additive effect in cells expressing most 72R and 72P mutations, except for the 175-72R cells which were refractory to combined treatment. However, combined treatment with cisplatin + gemcitabine resulted in the absence of an additive effect in cells expressing the 273-72R and 282-72R mutants, unlike their 72P counterparts. Nonetheless, all p53 mutants (72R or 72P) equally inhibited p73-mediated transcriptional activity in lung cancer cells, suggesting that the selective resistance conferred by some 72R mutants to certain drugs is probably due to other p73-independent effects of these mutants. Together, the data show that the status of codon 72 polymorphism and p53 mutations can be used as a means for prediction of treatment response, although variables for each cancer type requires detailed evaluation.	0
Genomic Profile of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in Korea Identified by Targeted Sequencing. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Asian Continental Ancestry Group Case-Control Studies Chromosome Aberrations European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genetic Loci Genome, Human Humans Leukemia, Lymphoid Male Middle Aged Mutation Mutation Rate Republic of Korea || Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is extremely rare in Asian countries and there has been one report on genetic changes for 5 genes (TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, MYD88, and BIRC3) by Sanger sequencing in Chinese CLL. Yet studies of CLL in Asian countries using Next generation sequencing have not been reported. We aimed to characterize the genomic profiles of Korean CLL and to find out ethnic differences in somatic mutations with prognostic implications. We performed targeted sequencing for 87 gene panel using next-generation sequencing along with G-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome 12, 13q14.3 deletion, 17p13 deletion, and 11q22 deletion. Overall, 36 out of 48 patients (75%) harbored at least one mutation and mean number of mutation per patient was 1.6 (range 0-6). Aberrant karyotypes were observed in 30.4% by G-banding and 66.7% by FISH. Most recurrent mutation (>10% frequency) was ATM (20.8%) followed by TP53 (14.6%), SF3B1 (10.4%), KLHL6 (8.3%), and BCOR (6.25%). Mutations of MYD88 was associated with moderate adverse prognosis by multiple comparisons (P = 0.055). Mutation frequencies of MYD88, SAMHD1, EGR2, DDX3X, ZMYM3, and MED12 showed similar incidence with Caucasians, while mutation frequencies of ATM, TP53, KLHL6, BCOR and CDKN2A tend to be higher in Koreans than in Caucasians. Especially, ATM mutation showed 1.5 fold higher incidence than Caucasians, while mutation frequencies of SF3B1, NOTCH1, CHD2 and POT1 tend to be lower in Koreans than in Caucasians. However, mutation frequencies between Caucasians and Koreans were not significantly different statistically, probably due to low number of patients. Collectively, mutational profile and adverse prognostic genes in Korean CLL were different from those of Caucasians, suggesting an ethnic difference, while profile of cytogenetic aberrations was similar to those of Caucasians.	4
Sensorineural hearing loss and the incidence of Cx26 mutations in Austria. || Austria Connexin 26 Connexins Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Pedigree || A clinical evaluation and Cx26 mutation analysis was performed in 92 consecutive patients with sensorineural hearing loss in order to delineate the spectrum of genetically caused hearing loss. Among patients of Austrian origin, 53% were classified with hereditary hearing loss. Cx26 mutations were found in 26% of NSHL patients (40% of familial vs 18% of sporadic cases). The mutation 35delG accounted for 52.8% of all presumed GJB2 disease alleles. The second most frequent mutation was L90P (16.7%) having been reported with a prevalence of 0.7-3.5% in other populations. Three novel mutations were found. The novel mutation, R143Q, was associated with dominant high-frequency hearing loss. Pseudodominant transmission of NSHL was seen in four families with Cx26 mutations. A mutation 35delG carrier rate of 0.9% was observed among 672 controls from West-Austria. Cx26 mutations were found associated with mild to profound, and with asymmetric hearing impairment.	4
Cooperative actions of p21WAF1 and p53 induce Slug protein degradation and suppress cell invasion. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Gamma Rays Humans Lung Neoplasms Neoplasm Invasiveness Protein Binding Proteolysis Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Snail Family Transcription Factors Transcription Factors Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || How the p53 transcription factor/tumor suppressor inhibits cell invasion is poorly understood. We demonstrate that this function of p53 requires its direct interaction with p21(WAF1), a transcriptional target of p53, and that both p21 and p53 bind to Slug, which promotes cell invasion. Functional studies reveal that p21 and p53 cooperate to facilitate Mdm2-dependent Slug degradation and that this p53 function is mimicked by p53(R273H), a mutant lacking trans-activating activity. These actions of p21 and p53 are induced by γ-irradiation of cells and also operate in vivo. This is the first study to elucidate a mechanism involving p53 and p21 cooperation.	0
Biophysical properties of human β-cardiac myosin with converter mutations that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Amino Acid Substitution Cardiomegaly Genetic Diseases, Inborn Humans Mutation, Missense Ventricular Myosins || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects 1 in 500 individuals and is an important cause of arrhythmias and heart failure. Clinically, HCM is characterized as causing hypercontractility, and therapies are aimed toward controlling the hyperactive physiology. Mutations in the β-cardiac myosin comprise ~40% of genetic mutations associated with HCM, and the converter domain of myosin is a hotspot for HCM-causing mutations; however, the underlying primary effects of these mutations on myosin's biomechanical function remain elusive. We hypothesize that these mutations affect the biomechanical properties of myosin, such as increasing its intrinsic force and/or its duty ratio and therefore the ensemble force of the sarcomere. Using recombinant human β-cardiac myosin, we characterize the molecular effects of three severe HCM-causing converter domain mutations: R719W, R723G, and G741R. Contrary to our hypothesis, the intrinsic forces of R719W and R723G mutant myosins are decreased compared to wild type and unchanged for G741R. Actin and regulated thin filament gliding velocities are ~15% faster for R719W and R723G myosins, whereas there is no change in velocity for G741R. Adenosine triphosphatase activities and the load-dependent velocity change profiles of all three mutant proteins are very similar to those of wild type. These results indicate that the net biomechanical properties of human β-cardiac myosin carrying these converter domain mutations are very similar to those of wild type or are even slightly hypocontractile, leading us to consider an alternative mechanism for the clinically observed hypercontractility. Future work includes how these mutations affect protein interactions within the sarcomere that increase the availability of myosin heads participating in force production.	0
Mutation analysis of the SHOC2 gene in Noonan-like syndrome and in hematologic malignancies. || Adolescent Cell Line Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Hematologic Neoplasms Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Male Mutation Noonan Syndrome RNA, Messenger Young Adult || Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by dysmorphic features, webbed neck, cardiac anomalies, short stature and cryptorchidism. It shows phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Noonan syndrome and related disorders are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding molecules in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in SHOC2, p.S2G, has been identified as causative for a type of Noonan-like syndrome characterized by the presence of loose anagen hair. In order to understand the contribution of SHOC2 mutations to the clinical manifestations of Noonan syndrome and related disorders, we analyzed SHOC2 in 92 patients with Noonan syndrome and related disorders who did not exhibit PTPN11, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/2, SOS1 or RAF1 mutations. We found the previously identified p.S2G mutation in eight of our patients. We developed a rapid detection system to identify the p.S2G mutation using melting curve analysis, which will be a useful tool to screen for the apparently common mutation. All the patients with the p.S2G mutation showed short stature, sparse hair and atopic skin. Six of the mutation-positive patients showed severe mental retardation and easily pluckable hair, and one showed leukocytosis. No SHOC2 mutations were identified in leukemia cells from 82 leukemia patients. These results suggest that clinical manifestations in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients partially overlap with those in patients with typical Noonan or CFC syndrome and show that easily pluckable/loose anagen hair is distinctive in SHOC2 mutation-positive patients.	4
Different presentations of late-detected phenylketonuria in two brothers with the same R408W/R111X genotype in the PAH gene. ||  || Although the clinical heterogeneity of phenylketonuria (PKU) is well established, some questions about this condition remain. Subjects from the same family who share the same mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene are expected to display similar disease courses, and therefore, when blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels, genotype and dietary treatment are all similar, differences in patient outcomes require additional explanations. The present authors describe two entirely different courses of late-detected PKU in two brothers with the same R408W/R111X genotype in the PAH gene. The older sibling was diagnosed with PKU at the age of 4 years and given treatment. His IQ was 97 at 26 years of age and moderate involvement of periventricular white matter was detected. The younger brother was diagnosed with PKU at the age of 11 months and given treatment. His IQ was < 25 at 22 years of age and severe dysmyelination changes were found by magnetic resonance imaging. The differences in the courses of the disease between these two brothers appear to be related to variations in their blood-brain barriers.	1 3

We evaluated the completeness and reproducibility of RAS-testing in the Netherlands. From 17 laboratories, tumor DNA of the first 10 CRC cases tested in 2014 in routine clinical practice was re-tested by a reference laboratory using a custom next generation sequencing panel. In total, 171 CRC cases were re-evaluated for hotspot mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF. Most laboratories had introduced complete RAS-testing (65%) and BRAF-testing (71%) by January 2014. The most employed method for all hotspot regions was Sanger sequencing (range 35.7 - 49.2%). The reference laboratory detected all mutations that had been found in the participating laboratories (n = 92), plus 10 additional mutations. This concerned three RAS and seven BRAF mutations that were missed due to incomplete testing of the participating laboratory. Overall, the concordance of tests performed by both the reference and participating laboratory was 100% (163/163; κ-static 1.0) for RAS and 100% (144/144; κ-static 1.0) for BRAF. Our study shows that RAS and BRAF mutations can be reproducibly assessed using a variety of testing methods.	4
Association of GJB2 gene mutation with cochlear implant performance in genetic non-syndromic hearing loss. || Adolescent Audiometry Child Child, Preschool Cochlear Implants Connexin 26 Connexins Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Mutation Treatment Outcome || To analyze the association of GJB2 gene mutations with cochlear implant performance in children. Sixty-five consecutive children who underwent cochlear implantation due to congenital profound senseurineural hearing between 2006 and 2008 were included in the study. In children, GJB2 gene mutation analysis was performed. Their auditory performance was assessed using MAIS, MUSS and LittlEARS tests. Twenty-two of sixty-five patients GJB2 mutations, and 35delG was the most frequent mutation. No significant difference was found between the auditory performance of mutation positive and negative children after one year follow up (p>0.05). GJB2 gene mutations do not impact on the outcome of cochlear implantation.	4
The somatic mutation landscape of premalignant colorectal adenoma. || Adenocarcinoma Adenoma Adult Cohort Studies Colorectal Neoplasms Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Precancerous Conditions Whole Exome Sequencing || There are few studies which characterised the molecular alterations in premalignant colorectal adenomas. Our major goal was to establish colorectal adenoma genome atlas and identify molecular markers of progression from colorectal adenoma to adenocarcinoma. Whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing were carried out in 149 adenoma samples and paired blood from patients with conventional adenoma or sessile serrated adenoma to characterise the somatic mutation landscape for premalignant colorectal lesions. The identified somatic mutations were compared with those in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A supervised random forest model was employed to identify gene panels differentiating adenoma from CRC. Similar somatic mutation frequencies, but distinctive driver mutations, were observed in sessile serrated adenomas and conventional adenomas. The final model included 20 genes and was able to separate the somatic mutation profile of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma with an area under the curve of 0.941. The findings of this project hold potential to better identify patients with adenoma who may be candidates for targeted surveillance programmes and preventive interventions to reduce the incidence of CRC.	4

Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features, congenital heart defects, and abnormalities of the skin and hair. Systematically to characterize the spectrum of dermatological findings in mutation-positive individuals with CFC syndrome. Dermatological surveys were designed by the authors and distributed to the study participants through CFC International or directly by the authors (K.A.R. and D.H.S.) between July 2006 and August 2009. A second follow-up survey was collected between December 2007 and August 2009. When available, digital images and medical records of the participants were obtained. Study participants included individuals with CFC syndrome who have a mutation in BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2 or KRAS. Individuals with CFC syndrome have a variety of dermatological manifestations caused by dysregulation of the MAPK pathway in development. Numerous acquired melanocytic naevi were one of the most striking features: more than 50 naevi were reported by 23% (14/61) of participants and of those, more than 100 naevi were reported by 36% (5/14). Keratosis pilaris was reported in 80% (49/61) of cases. Ulerythema ophryogenes was common, occurring in 90% (55/61). Infantile haemangiomas occurred at a greater frequency, 26% (16/61), as compared with the general population. CFC syndrome has a complex dermatological phenotype with many cutaneous features, some of which allow it to be differentiated from the other Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes. Multiple café-au-lait macules and papillomas were not identified in this CFC cohort, helping to distinguish CFC from other RASopathies such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and Costello syndrome.	4
Cancer systems biology of TCGA SKCM: efficient detection of genomic drivers in melanoma. || Adult Cell Proliferation DNA Copy Number Variations Genomics Humans Male Melanoma Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Systems Biology || We characterized the mutational landscape of human skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) using data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We analyzed next-generation sequencing data of somatic copy number alterations and somatic mutations in 303 metastatic melanomas. We were able to confirm preeminent drivers of melanoma as well as identify new melanoma genes. The TCGA SKCM study confirmed a dominance of somatic BRAF mutations in 50% of patients. The mutational burden of melanoma patients is an order of magnitude higher than of other TCGA cohorts. A multi-step filter enriched somatic mutations while accounting for recurrence, conservation, and basal rate. Thus, this filter can serve as a paradigm for analysis of genome-wide next-generation sequencing data of large cohorts with a high mutational burden. Analysis of TCGA melanoma data using such a multi-step filter discovered novel and statistically significant potential melanoma driver genes. In the context of the Pan-Cancer study we report a detailed analysis of the mutational landscape of BRAF and other drivers across cancer tissues. Integrated analysis of somatic mutations, somatic copy number alterations, low pass copy numbers, and gene expression of the melanogenesis pathway shows coordination of proliferative events by Gs-protein and cyclin signaling at a systems level.	4
Mutational analysis of the LDLR gene in a cohort of Colombian families with familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by elevated serum cholesterol levels due to high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. FH is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder and one of the most common dominant hereditary diseases in the world. However, the frequency of mutations in Colombia is unknown. The purpose of this preliminary study was to identify mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene in a Colombian population with FH. The study included 24 families with clinical diagnosis of sure/probable FH. The 18 exons of the LDLR were sequenced by Sanger method. Among 18 variants identified, 3 were known pathogenic mutations and were identified in nine individuals in five unrelated families. Five affected individuals were heterozygous for one mutation each. They were the p.W4X in two, the p.D139G in two and the p.G396D in one. Two affected individuals were homozygous for p.G396D. The variant c.1187-1G > T, which has uncertain significance in FH pathogenesis, was present in all the individuals with the p.D139G mutation. In total, 18 variants were identified, of which 14 correspond to known nonpathogenic variants. Three pathogenic variants were identified in the LDLR. No pathological mutations were identified in the LDLR in 79% of the study population.	4
Clinical characteristics and course of 63 patients with BRAF mutant lung cancers. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cohort Studies Female Genotype Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf || Mutant BRAF is a driver oncogene found in 2% of lung adenocarcinomas and represents a target for therapy. We examined the clinical characteristics and course of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations. We identified patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations between 2009 and 2013 detected using a mass spectrometry-based polymerase chain reaction genotyping assay of hot-spot mutations involving codons corresponding to amino acids V600, D594, and G469 of BRAF. Patient characteristics and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) was compared with stage-matched patients with KRAS and EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinomas. Sixty-three patients were diagnosed with BRAF mutant lung adenocarcinomas between 2009 and 2013 (V600, 36; non-V600, 27). The majority of patients with BRAF mutations were smokers (92%), although patients with V600 mutations were more likely to be light/never-smokers compared with patients with non-V600 mutations (42% versus 11%; p = 0.007). Of the 32 patients with early-stage disease, six (19%; 95% confidence interval 7%-36%) developed second primary lung cancers harboring KRAS mutations. Patients with advanced V600 mutant lung adenocarcinomas had a better survival from diagnosis compared with those with non-V600 mutant lung adenocarcinomas (3-year OS: 24% versus 0%; p < 0.001). This is the largest series of patients with BRAF mutant lung cancers described. Most patients were heavy smokers. Nineteen percent of patients with early-stage BRAF mutant lung cancers developed second primary lung cancers harboring KRAS mutations. Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas harboring V600 mutations have an improved OS compared with those with non-V600 mutations.	4
Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: functional variance among individual cardiomyocytes as a trigger of FHC-phenotype development. ||  || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is the most frequent inherited cardiac disease. It has been related to numerous mutations in many sarcomeric and even some non-sarcomeric proteins. So far, however, no common mechanism has been identified by which the many different mutations in different sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric proteins trigger development of the FHC phenotype. Here we show for different MYH7 mutations variance in force pCa-relations from normal to highly abnormal as a feature common to all mutations we studied, while direct functional effects of the different FHC-mutations, e.g., on force generation, ATPase or calcium sensitivity of the contractile system, can be quite different. The functional variation among individual M. soleus fibers of FHC-patients is accompanied by large variation in mutant vs. wildtype β-MyHC-mRNA. Preliminary results show a similar variation in mutant vs. wildtype β-MyHC-mRNA among individual cardiomyocytes. We discuss our previously proposed concept as to how different mutations in the β-MyHC and possibly other sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric proteins may initiate an FHC-phenotype by functional variation among individual cardiomyocytes that results in structural distortions within the myocardium, leading to cellular and myofibrillar disarray. In addition, distortions can activate stretch-sensitive signaling in cardiomyocytes and non-myocyte cells which is known to induce cardiac remodeling with interstitial fibrosis and hypertrophy. Such a mechanism will have major implications for therapeutic strategies to prevent FHC-development, e.g., by reducing functional imbalances among individual cardiomyocytes or by inhibition of their triggering of signaling paths initiating remodeling. Targeting increased or decreased contractile function would require selective targeting of mutant or wildtype protein to reduce functional imbalances.	0
Somatic profiling of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in tumors from patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy ± cetuximab. || Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinogenesis Cetuximab Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Clinical Trials as Topic Colorectal Neoplasms ErbB Receptors High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Microsatellite Instability Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Staging Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || To study the somatic molecular profile of the EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway in advanced colorectal cancer, its relationship to prognosis, the site of the primary and metastases, and response to cetuximab. We used Sequenom and Pyrosequencing for high-throughput somatic profiling of the EGFR pathway in 1,976 tumors from patients with advanced colorectal cancer from the COIN trial (oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy ± cetuximab). Correlations between mutations, clinicopathologic, response, and survival data were carried out. Sequenom and Pyrosequencing had 99.0% (9,961/10,063) genotype concordance. We identified 13 different KRAS mutations in 42.3% of advanced colorectal cancers, 2 BRAF mutations in 9.0%, 4 NRAS mutations in 3.6%, and 5 PIK3CA mutations in 12.7%. 4.2% of advanced colorectal cancers had microsatellite instability (MSI). KRAS and PIK3CA exon 9, but not exon 20, mutations cooccurred (P = 8.9 × 10(-4)) as did MSI and BRAF mutations (P = 5.3 × 10(-10)). KRAS mutations were associated with right colon cancers (P = 5.2 × 10(-5)) and BRAF mutations with right (P = 7.2 × 10(-5)) and transverse colon (P = 9.8 × 10(-6)) cancers. KRAS mutations were associated with lung-only metastases (P = 2.3 × 10(-4)), BRAF mutations with peritoneal (P = 9.2 × 10(-4)) and nodal-only (P = 3.7 × 10(-5)) metastases, and MSI (BRAF(WT)) with nodal-only metastases (P = 2.9 × 10(-4)). MSI (BRAF(WT)) was associated with worse survival (HR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.30-2.76, P = 8.5 × 10(-4)). No mutations, subsets of mutations, or MSI status were associated with response to cetuximab. Our data support a functional cooperation between KRAS and PIK3CA in colorectal tumorigenesis and link somatic profiles to the sites of metastases. MSI was associated with poor prognosis in advanced disease, and no individual somatic profile was associated with response to cetuximab in COIN.	4
Prevalence and phenotypic correlations of EIF1AX mutations in thyroid nodules. || EIF1AX FNA follicular adenoma papillary carcinoma thyroid || The EIF1AX gene mutations have been recently found in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). The prevalence of these mutations in other types of thyroid cancers and benign nodules is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the occurrence of EIF1AX mutations in exons 2, 5, and 6 of the gene in a series of 266 thyroid tumors and hyperplastic nodules by either Sanger or next-generation sequencing (ThyroSeq v.2). In addition, 647 thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples with indeterminate cytology were analyzed. Using surgically removed samples, EIF1AX mutations were detected in 3/86 (2.3%) PTC, 1/4 (25%) ATC, 0/53 follicular carcinomas, 0/12 medullary carcinomas, 2/27 (7.4%) follicular adenomas, and 1/80 (1.3%) hyperplastic nodules. Among five mutation-positive FNA samples with surgical follow-up, one nodule was PTC and others were benign follicular adenomas or hyperplastic nodules. Overall, among 33 mutations identified, A113_splice mutation at the intron 5/exon 6 splice site of EIF1AX was the most common. All four carcinomas harbored A113_splice mutation and three of them had one or more coexisting mutations, typically RAS All PTC carrying EIF1AX mutations were encapsulated follicular variants. In summary, this study shows that EIF1AX mutations occur not only in thyroid carcinomas, but also in benign nodules. The most common mutation hotspot is the A113_splice, followed by a cluster of mutations in exon 2. When found in thyroid FNA samples, EIF1AX mutations confer ~20% risk of cancer; the risk is likely to be higher in nodules carrying a A113_splice mutation and when EIF1AX coexists with RAS mutations.	4
Neonatal lethal Costello syndrome and unusual dinucleotide deletion/insertion mutations in HRAS predicting p.Gly12Val. || Costello Syndrome Diagnosis, Differential Genes, ras Heart Defects, Congenital Humans INDEL Mutation Infant, Newborn || De novo heterozygous mutations in HRAS cause Costello syndrome (CS), a condition with high mortality and morbidity in infancy and early childhood due to cardiac, respiratory, and muscular complications. HRAS mutations predicting p.Gly12Val, p.Gly12Asp, and p.Gly12Cys substitutions have been associated with severe, lethal, CS. We report on molecular, clinical, and pathological findings in patients with mutations predicting HRAS p.Gly12Val that were identified in our clinical molecular genetic testing service. Such mutations were identified in four patients. Remarkably, three were deletion/insertion mutations affecting coding nucleotides 35 and 36. All patients died within 6 postnatal weeks, providing further evidence that p.Gly12Val mutations predict a very poor prognosis. High birth weight, polyhydramnios (and premature birth), cardiac hypertrophy, respiratory distress, muscle weakness, and postnatal growth failure were present. Dysmorphism was subtle or non-specific, with edema, coarsened facial features, prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nares, and low-set ears. Proximal upper limb shortening, a small bell-shaped chest, talipes, and fixed flexion deformities of the wrists were seen. Neonatal atrial arrhythmia, highly suggestive of CS, was also present in two patients. One patient had congenital alveolar dysplasia, and another, born after 36 weeks' gestation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia. A rapidly fatal disease course, and the difficulty of identifying subtle dysmorphism in neonates requiring intensive care, suggest that this condition remains under-recognized, and should enter the differential diagnosis for very sick infants with a range of clinical problems including cardiac hypertrophy and disordered pulmonary development. Clinical management should be informed by knowledge of the poor prognosis of this condition.	4
Biological role of connexin intercellular channels and hemichannels. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Communication Cell Cycle Connexins Gap Junctions Humans Neoplasms Stem Cells || Gap junctions (GJ) and hemichannels (HC) formed from the protein subunits called connexins are transmembrane conduits for the exchange of small molecules and ions. Connexins and another group of HC-forming proteins, pannexins comprise the two families of transmembrane proteins ubiquitously distributed in vertebrates. Most cell types express more than one connexin or pannexin. While connexin expression and channel activity may vary as a function of physiological and pathological states of the cell and tissue, only a few studies suggest the involvement of pannexin HC in acquired pathological conditions. Importantly, genetic mutations in connexin appear to interfere with GJ and HC function which results in several diseases. Thus connexins could serve as potential drug target for therapeutic intervention. Growing evidence suggests that diseases resulting from HC dysfunction might open a new direction for development of specific HC reagents. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current studies of GJ and HC formed by connexins and pannexins in various tissue and organ systems including heart, central nervous system, kidney, mammary glands, ovary, testis, lens, retina, inner ear, bone, cartilage, lung and liver. In addition, present knowledge of the role of GJ and HC in cell cycle progression, carcinogenesis and stem cell development is also discussed.	0
Keratinocytic epidermal nevus syndrome with Schwann cell proliferation, lipomatous tumour and mosaic KRAS mutation. || Adolescent Cell Proliferation Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Infant Lipoma Male Mutation Nevus Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Schwann Cells Skin Diseases Young Adult ras Proteins || Keratinocytic epidermal nevus syndrome (KENS) is a complex disorder not only characterized by the presence of epidermal nevi but also by abnormalities in the internal organ systems. A small number of cases with KENS are molecularly characterized and reported in the literature with somatic activating RAS, FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations. In this study we present a patient with hyper- and hypopigmented regions, verrucous pigmented skin lesions and a paravertebral conglomerate tumour at the level of the cervical and thoracic spine. A large lipomatous dumbbell tumour caused atrophy of the spinal cord with progressive paraparesis. We identified a mosaic c.35G > A (p.Gly12Asp) KRAS mutation in the pigmented verrucous epidermal nevus tissue, the intraneural schwann cells and the lipoma. The c.35G > A (p.Gly12Asp) KRAS mutation was absent in the peripheral blood leukocytes. We conclude that KENS, the intraneural Schwann cell proliferation and the lipoma in this individual were caused by a postzygotic and mosaic activating c.35G > A (p.Gly12Asp) KRAS mutation.	4
The ACE I/D polymorphism does not explain heterogeneity of natural course and response to enzyme replacement therapy in Pompe disease. ||  || The majority of children and adults with Pompe disease in the population of European descent carry the leaky splicing GAA variant c.-32-13T>G (IVS1) in combination with a fully deleterious GAA variant on the second allele. The phenotypic spectrum of this patient group is exceptionally broad, with symptom onset ranging from early infancy to late adulthood. In addition, the response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) varies between patients. The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has been suggested to be a modifier of disease onset and/or response to ERT. Here, we have investigated the effect of the ACE I/D polymorphism in a relatively large cohort of 131 children and adults with Pompe disease, of whom 112 were followed during treatment with ERT for 5 years. We assessed the use of wheelchair and mechanical ventilation, muscle strength assessed via manual muscle testing and hand-held dynamometry (HHD), distance walked on the six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC) in sitting and supine position and daily-life activities assessed by R-PAct. Cross sectional analysis at first visit showed no differences between the genotypes with respect to age at first symptoms, diagnosis, wheelchair use, or ventilator use. Also response to ERT over 5 years assessed by linear mixed model analyses showed no significant differences between ACE groups for any of the outcome measures. The patient cohort contained 24 families with 54 siblings. Differences in ACE genotype could neither explain inter nor intra familial differences. We conclude that the ACE I/D polymorphism does not explain the large variation in disease severity and response to ERT observed among Pompe patients with the same c.-32-13T>G GAA variant.	1
GJB2 Mutation Spectrum and Genotype-Phenotype Correlation in 1067 Han Chinese Subjects with Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss. || Adolescent Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Ethnic Groups Female Genetic Association Studies Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Young Adult || Mutations in Gap Junction Beta 2 (GJB2) have been reported to be a major cause of non-syndromic hearing loss in many populations worldwide. The spectrums and frequencies of GJB2 variants vary substantially among different ethnic groups, and the genotypes among these populations remain poorly understood. In the present study, we carried out a systematic and extended mutational screening of GJB2 gene in 1067 Han Chinese subjects with non-syndromic hearing loss, and the resultant GJB2 variants were evaluated by phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis. A total of 25 (23 known and 2 novel) GJB2 variants were identified, including 6 frameshift mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, 16 missense mutations and 2 silent mutations. In this cohort, c.235delC is the most frequently observed pathogenic mutation. The phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis showed that 2 novel variants c.127G>T (p.V43L), c.293G>C (p.R98P) and 2 known variants c. 107T>C (p.L36P) and c.187G>T (p.V63L) are localized at highly conserved amino acids. In addition, these 4 mutations are absent in 203 healthy individuals, therefore, they are probably the most likely candidate pathogenic mutations. In addition, 66 (24 novel and 42 known) genotypes were identified, including 6 homozygotes, 20 compound heterozygotes, 18 single heterozygotes, 21 genotypes harboring only polymorphism(s) and the wild type genotype. Among these, 153 (14.34%) subjects were homozygous for pathogenic mutations, 63 (5.91%) were compound heterozygotes, and 157 (14.71%) carried single heterozygous mutation. Furthermore, 65.28% (141/216) of these cases with two pathogenic mutations exhibited profound hearing loss. These data suggested that mutations in GJB2 gene are responsible for approximately 34.96% of non-syndromic hearing loss in Han Chinese population from Zhejiang Province in eastern China. In addition, our results also strongly supported the idea that other factors such as alterations in regulatory regions, additional genes, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical manifestation of deafness.	4
Three prevalent mutations in a patient with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: implications for diagnosis and genetic counselling. || Adolescent Alleles Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Female Genetic Counseling Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Prenatal Diagnosis || Mutation analysis in a patient with mild hyperphenylalaninaemia showed three distinct base substitutions in exon 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. All three mutations, R413P, Y414C, and D415N, have previously been described as being independently associated with PAH deficiency. Family studies and independent analysis of the PAH alleles of the patient showed cosegregation of the R413P and Y414C mutations. Data on the ethnic background of the family provide evidence that the R413P mutation has occurred on a PAH allele carrying the Y414C mutation. Using current methods for mutation identification, the presence of two known mutations on a single PAH allele implies the risk of misdiagnosis of PAH deficiency and complicates genetic counselling. Our results stress the need for comprehensive mutation scanning of the PAH gene in diagnostic settings.	3
Molecular characterization of a selected cohort of patients affected by pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma: Hints from BRAF, NRAS and EGFR evaluation. || Adolescent Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival ErbB Receptors Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Gene Amplification Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Kaplan-Meier Estimate Lung Neoplasms Male Membrane Proteins Metastasectomy Middle Aged Mutation Odds Ratio Phenotype Pneumonectomy Predictive Value of Tests Proportional Hazards Models Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Risk Factors Skin Neoplasms Time Factors Treatment Outcome Tumor Burden Young Adult || Melanoma is highly curable in early stages but holds devastating consequences in advanced phases with a median survival of 6-10 months. Lungs are a common metastasis target, but despite this, limited data are available on the molecular status of pulmonary lesions. 25 patients with surgically resected melanoma lung metastases were screened for BRAF, NRAS, CKIT and EGFR alterations. The results were correlated with time to lung metastasis (TLM), relapse-free survival after metastasectomy (RFS) and overall survival (OS). BRAF or NRAS were mutated in 52% and 20% of cases while CKIT was unaffected. Chromosome 7 polysomy was detected in 47% of cases with 17.5% showing EGFR amplification and concomitant BRAF mutation. NRAS mutated patients developed LM within 5 yrs from primary melanoma with larger lesions compared with BRAF (mean diameter 3.3 ± 2.2cm vs 1.9 ± 1.1cm, p = 0.2). NRAS was also associated with a shorter median RFS and OS after metastasectomy. Moreover, Cox regression analysis revealed that NRAS mutation was the only predictive factor of shorter survival from primary melanoma (p = 0.039, OR = 5.5 (1.1-27.6)). Molecular characterization identifies advanced melanoma subgroups with distinct prognosis and therapeutic options. The presence of NRAS mutation was associated to a worse disease evolution.	4

Screening for these mutations was performed on 38 patients from Cantabria with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment of congenital/childhood onset. The A1555G mutation was detected in homoplasmy in 9 patients (23.7%). Three individuals were heterozygous for the 35delG mutation (7.9%). The heterozygous del(GJB6-D13S1830) deletion was present in one case (2.6%). One subject was homozygous for the Q829X mutation (2.6%). These four mutations are present in 36.8% of all cases of non-syndromic hearing impairment in our population.	4
An update on the genetics of usher syndrome. ||  || Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and, in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and is the most common cause underlying deafness and blindness of genetic origin. Clinically, USH is divided into three types. Usher type I (USH1) is the most severe form and is characterized by severe to profound congenital deafness, vestibular areflexia, and prepubertal onset of progressive RP. Type II (USH2) displays moderate to severe hearing loss, absence of vestibular dysfunction, and later onset of retinal degeneration. Type III (USH3) shows progressive postlingual hearing loss, variable onset of RP, and variable vestibular response. To date, five USH1 genes have been identified: MYO7A (USH1B), CDH23 (USH1D), PCDH15 (USH1F), USH1C(USH1C), and USH1G(USH1G). Three genes are involved in USH2, namely, USH2A (USH2A), GPR98 (USH2C), and DFNB31 (USH2D). USH3 is rare except in certain populations, and the gene responsible for this type is USH3A.	1
Significance of P53 in human thyroid tumors. || Base Sequence Cell Line Genes, p53 Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Polymerase Chain Reaction Prognosis Thyroid Neoplasms || Mutational changes in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most frequent genetic alterations in human malignant tumors. Studies have shown a correlation of p53 expression in breast cancer with tumor prognosis. In contrast to mutational activation of ras and GSP in thyroid tumors, little is known about the role of p53 in thyroid tumor development. Therefore thyroid tumors and thyroid tumor cell lines were studied for the presence of p53 mutations. Snap-frozen tissues from 57 differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) and 5 goiters were studied by immunohistochemical methods. A panel of six antibodies (pAb 240, 421, 1620, 1801, DO7, and CM1) was employed by using the ABC technique. Five cell lines from DTCs (FTC133, 236, 238, PTC337, MTC164) were examined by the same technique. Additionally, genomic DNA from the cells was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the PCR product studied for p53 mutations (R273H) by mutation-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (MOH) and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) for the p53 exon 8. None of the benign thyroid tumors and 7 of 57 (12%) DTCs strongly express p53 with a heterogeneous distribution in the tumor tissue. All seven patients have metastatic disease or dedifferentiated tumors G3 (three of seven). CM1 was positive in two cell lines (FTC-133, PTC-337), questionable in FTC-238, and negative in FTC-236 and MTC-164. All three follicular cell lines, however, and the original tumor tissue showed the same p53 mutation (R273H) in MOH analysis and TGGE. P53 mutations are rare in thyroid tumors, but the presence of p53 mutations indicates a poor prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
Activation of phenylalanine hydroxylase by phenylalanine does not require binding in the active site. || Allosteric Regulation Allosteric Site Amino Acid Substitution Animals Arginine Catalytic Domain Enzyme Activation Kinetics Models, Molecular Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutant Proteins Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Protein Conformation Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Rats Recombinant Proteins Spectrometry, Fluorescence || Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH), a liver enzyme that catalyzes the hydroxylation of excess phenylalanine in the diet to tyrosine, is activated by phenylalanine. The lack of activity at low levels of phenylalanine has been attributed to the N-terminus of the protein's regulatory domain acting as an inhibitory peptide by blocking substrate access to the active site. The location of the site at which phenylalanine binds to activate the enzyme is unknown, and both the active site in the catalytic domain and a separate site in the N-terminal regulatory domain have been proposed. Binding of catecholamines to the active-site iron was used to probe the accessibility of the active site. Removal of the regulatory domain increases the rate constants for association of several catecholamines with the wild-type enzyme by ∼2-fold. Binding of phenylalanine in the active site is effectively abolished by mutating the active-site residue Arg270 to lysine. The k(cat)/K(phe) value is down 10⁴ for the mutant enzyme, and the K(m) value for phenylalanine for the mutant enzyme is >0.5 M. Incubation of the R270K enzyme with phenylalanine also results in a 2-fold increase in the rate constants for catecholamine binding. The change in the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum seen in the wild-type enzyme upon activation by phenylalanine is also seen with the R270K mutant enzyme in the presence of phenylalanine. Both results establish that activation of PheH by phenylalanine does not require binding of the amino acid in the active site. This is consistent with a separate allosteric site, likely in the regulatory domain.	0
Characterization of Somatic Mutations in Air Pollution-Related Lung Cancer. || Aged Air Pollutants Air Pollution Base Sequence Benzo(a)pyrene Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Coal Environmental Exposure Female Gene Frequency Genome Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Mutation Rate Sequence Analysis, DNA Smoke || Air pollution has been classified as Group 1 carcinogenic to humans, but the underlying tumorigenesis remains unclear. In Xuanwei City of Yunnan Province, the lung cancer incidence is among the highest in China attributed to severe air pollution generated by combustion of smoky coal, providing a unique opportunity to dissect lung carcinogenesis of air pollution. Here we analyzed the somatic mutations of 164 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) from Xuanwei and control regions (CR) where smoky coal was not used. Whole genome sequencing revealed a mean of 289 somatic exonic mutations per tumor and the frequent C:G → A:T nucleotide substitutions in Xuanwei NSCLCs. Exome sequencing of 2010 genes showed that Xuanwei and CR NSCLCs had a mean of 68 and 22 mutated genes per tumor, respectively (p < 0.0001). We found 167 genes (including TP53, RYR2, KRAS, CACNA1E) which had significantly higher mutation frequencies in Xuanwei than CR patients, and mutations in most genes in Xuanwei NSCLCs differed from those in CR cases. The mutation rates of 70 genes (e.g., RYR2, MYH3, GPR144, CACNA1E) were associated with patients' lifetime benzo(a)pyrene exposure. This study uncovers the mutation spectrum of air pollution-related lung cancers, and provides evidence for pollution exposure-genomic mutation relationship at a large scale.	4
RAF neighborhood: protein-protein interaction in the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway. || Animals Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Protein Binding raf Kinases || The Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway, activated downstream of Ras primarily to promote proliferation, represents the best studied of the evolutionary conserved MAPK cascades. The investigation of the pathway has continued unabated since its discovery roughly 30 years ago. In the last decade, however, the identification of unexpected in vivo functions of pathway components, as well as the discovery of Raf mutations in human cancer, the ensuing quest for inhibitors, and the efforts to understand their mechanism of action, have boosted interest tremendously. From this large body of work, protein-protein interaction has emerged as a recurrent, crucial theme. This review focuses on the role of protein complexes in the regulation of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway and in its cross-talk with other signaling cascades. Mapping these interactions and finding a way of exploiting them for therapeutic purposes is one of the challenges of future molecule-targeted therapy.	0

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been used as a prognostic biomarker for the metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The molecular characterization of CTCs is fundamental to the phenotypic identification of malignant cells and description of the relevant genetic alterations that may change according to disease progression and therapy resistance. However, the molecular characterization of CTCs remains a challenge because of the rarity and heterogeneity of CTCs and technological difficulties in the enrichment, isolation and molecular characterization of CTCs. In this pilot study, we evaluated circulating tumor associated cells in one blood draw by size exclusion technology and cytological analysis. Among 30 prospectively enrolled MBC patients, CTCs, circulating tumor cell clusters (CTC clusters), CTCs of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs) were detected and analyzed. For molecular characterization of CTCs, size-exclusion method for CTC enrichment was tested in combination with DEPArray™ technology, which allows the recovery of single CTCs or pools of CTCs as a pure CTC sample for mutation analysis. Genomic mutations of TP53 andESR1 were analyzed by targeted sequencing on isolated 7 CTCs from a patient with MBC. The results of genomic analysis showed heterozygousTP53 R248W mutation from one single CTC and pools of three CTCs, and homozygousTP53 R248W mutation from one single CTC and pools of two CTCs. Wild-typeESR1 was detected in the same isolated CTCs. The results of this study reveal that size-exclusion method can be used to enrich and identify circulating tumor associated cells, and enriched CTCs were characterized for genetic alterations in MBC patients, respectively.	4
E-cadherin germline missense mutations and cell phenotype: evidence for the independence of cell invasion on the motile capabilities of the cells. ||  || In Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer syndrome, E-cadherin germline mutations of the missense type harbour significant functional consequences. In this study, we have characterised the effect of T340A, A617T, A634V and V832M E-cadherin germline missense mutations on cell morphology, motility and proliferation. Wild-type E-cadherin and A617T expressing cells have an epithelial-like morphology, with polarised cells migrating unidirectionally. T340A and A634V expressing cells, fibroblast-like, have a high motile phenotype. We show that this phenotype is dependent on an increased level of active RhoA. V832M expressing cells grow in piled-up structure of round cells, as an effect of the disturbance of the binding between alpha-catenin and beta-catenin. The destabilisation of the adhesion complex is shown to hamper the motile capabilities of these cells. We did not observe any effect of the E-cadherin mutations on cell proliferation. We show the existence of a genotype-phenotype correlation between different E-cadherin mutations and cell behaviour. However, we demonstrate that the ability of cells expressing the different E-cadherin mutations to invade is independent on their motile capabilities, providing evidence that motility is neither necessary nor sufficient for cells to invade. Our data give new insights into the understanding of the mechanisms linking invasion and E-cadherin mutations in diffuse gastric cancer.	0
Faster cross-bridge detachment and increased tension cost in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with the R403Q MYH7 mutation. || Adenosine Triphosphate Adult Aged Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Female Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle Relaxation Mutation, Missense Myocardial Contraction Myosin Heavy Chains Sarcomeres || The first mutation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the R403Q mutation in the gene encoding β-myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC). R403Q locates in the globular head of myosin (S1), responsible for interaction with actin, and thus motor function of myosin. Increased cross-bridge relaxation kinetics caused by the R403Q mutation might underlie increased energetic cost of tension generation; however, direct evidence is absent. Here we studied to what extent cross-bridge kinetics and energetics are related in single cardiac myofibrils and multicellular cardiac muscle strips of three HCM patients with the R403Q mutation and nine sarcomere mutation-negative HCM patients (HCMsmn). Expression of R403Q was on average 41 ± 4% of total MYH7 mRNA. Cross-bridge slow relaxation kinetics in single R403Q myofibrils was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than in HCMsmn myofibrils (0.47 ± 0.02 and 0.30 ± 0.02 s(-1), respectively). Moreover, compared to HCMsmn, tension cost was significantly higher in the muscle strips of the three R403Q patients (2.93 ± 0.25 and 1.78 ± 0.10 μmol l(-1) s(-1) kN(-1) m(-2), respectively) which showed a positive linear correlation with relaxation kinetics in the corresponding myofibril preparations. This correlation suggests that faster cross-bridge relaxation kinetics results in an increase in energetic cost of tension generation in human HCM with the R403Q mutation compared to HCMsmn. Therefore, increased tension cost might contribute to HCM disease in patients carrying the R403Q mutation.	4
GJB2 mutations: Genotypic and phenotypic correlation in a cohort of 690 hearing-impaired patients, toward a new mutation? || Audiometry Connexin 30 Connexins Databases, Factual Female Genotype Haplotypes Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Microsatellite Repeats Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Mutation Phenotype Prevalence Retrospective Studies || To analyze the clinical features of hearing impairment and to search for correlations with the genotype in patients with GJB2 mutations. Case series. Collaborative study in referral centers, institutional practice. A total of 690 hearing-impaired patients were genotypically and phenotypically described. The mutations of GJB2 and GJB6 were studied. Heterozygous patients were searched for another mutation by microsatellite approach. Prevalence of GJB2 mutations, microsatellite approach, hearing-impairment. In 498 patients (72,17% of the cohort), no mutation was found. Homozygotous patients were 59 (8,55%), with 51 for c.35delG, 6 for p.M34T and 2 for GJB6. Compound heterozygous were 64 (9,28%) with 56 c.35delG-others mutations. Genotypes with biallelic non sense mutations had a high risk of severe to profound hearing impairment. It was frequently milder in compound heterozygotes than in c.35delG homozygotes. Heterozygous patients were 69 (10%) with 21 c.35delG, 20 p.M34T and 28 others mutations. We selected patients with a complete historical medical file (clinical and audiometric data). Then, we performed a microsatellite approach (multiplex PCR of short DNA fragments) to localize a new pathologic allele. Seventeen heterozygous patients were studied. Six patients (35%) showed the same haplotype. They were compound heterozygous bearing a new pathologic allele. Genotype may affect deafness severity, but environmental and other genetic factors may also modulate the severity and evolution of GJB2-GJB6 deafness. A new haplotype for GJB2 is described but the exact mutation remains unknown.	4
Nodular Lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma in a 15-Year-Old Boy With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Having a Germline TP53 D49H Mutation. || Adolescent Female Genes, p53 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Hodgkin Disease Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Male Pedigree Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Germline mutations in TP53 are the primary cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Most mutations are reported within the DNA-binding domain. We report a case of a 15-year-old boy with LFS who developed early-stage nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare subtype of Hodgkin lymphomas. His sister was diagnosed with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma at the age of 1.5 years. Sequence analysis revealed a germline mutation in the transactivation domain of TP53, c.145G>C (p.D49H), in the patient, his sister, and father. One family with LFS with a germline TP53 D49H mutation has previously been reported. This report supports the pathogenicity of this mutation.	4
[Correlation between genotypes and biochemical phenotypes of phenylalanine hydroxylase in patients with phenylketonuria]. ||  || To investigate the correlation between genotypes and biochemical phenotypes of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Thirteen exons and flanking introns of PAH gene in 102 patients with high blood phenylalanine levels (Phe > 120 umol/L) at initial diagnosis were amplified with polymerase chain reaction and analyzed with single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and DNA sequencing. Correlation between genotypes and biochemical phenotypes was analyzed. Biochemical assaying has indicated that 69 patients had classical PKU (Phe> 1200 umol/L), 31 were moderate (Phe 600-1200 umol/L), and 2 were mild (Phe 400-600 umol/L). More than 41 mutations and 75 genotypes have been identified. There were 9 (8.8%) homozygous mutations, which included 3 cases with R111X/R111X, 1 case with IVS4-1G>A/IVS4-1G>A, 3 cases with R243Q/R243Q and 2 cases with V399V/V399V. Among these 8 belonged to classic PKU phenotypes, except for a R243Q/R243Q genotype which has led to a moderate phenotype. In 91 patients carrying compound PAH mutations, 61 were classic, 29 were moderate, and 1 was mild. Patients who were heterozygous for R111X/R243Q and EX6-96A>G(Y204C)/R243Q were found with both classic and moderate PKU phenotypes. Certain individuals who have carried 2 null mutant alleles such as R111X/V399V, EX6-96A>G/Y356X and EX6-96A>G/V399V only showed a moderate phenotype. Individuals with R111X/A165D and R176X/A165D genotypes, on the other hand, respectively presented moderate and classic PKU phenotypes. Ninety percent of our patients are compound heterozygotes. Independent assortment of mutant alleles has resulted in a complex genotype-phenotype correlation. Although in most cases a correlation may be found, caution should still be taken upon genetic counseling. The phenomena where similar or even identical genotype may give rise to different biochemical phenotypes have implied that other factors may also influence the phenylalanine metabolism.	1 3
[Advances in the diagnosis of phenylketonuria with the introduction of direct detection of PAH gene mutation]. || Genotype Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation Neonatal Screening Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction || Phenylketonuria is as regards the genotype a very heterogenous disease. Successful prenatal and postnatal DNA diagnosis calls for knowledge of different mutations in a given population. The objective of the investigation was to introduce direct detection of 21 mutations in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase and to find the distribution and frequency of these mutations in the population of northern and southern Moravia. The authors analyzed a group of 95 patients where according to phenotypic classification classical phenylketonuria was involved which comprised 190 mutant alleles. The presence of mutations was assessed by means of a polymerase chain reaction of a Perkin Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler 480. From the total number of 21 mutations which were sought, 11 were identified in our population, which accounts for 80% of all mutations. It was revealed that mutation R408W is found in 55.3% of our patients. Twenty per cent of the mutations are still unknown. This investigation laid the foundations for direct DNA diagnosis of phenylketonuria in the Czech Republic. The results assembled in the Moravian region suggest that our population is as regards genotypes relatively homogenous. This gives great hope of successful prenatal diagnosis and postnatal genotype classification.	1 3
Mutational studies on single circulating tumor cells isolated from the blood of inflammatory breast cancer patients. || Adult Aged Base Sequence Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Association Studies Humans Inflammatory Breast Neoplasms Middle Aged Neoplastic Cells, Circulating Receptor, ErbB-2 Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins Sequence Deletion Single-Cell Analysis Survival Analysis Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases || The molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is critical to identify the key drivers of cancer metastasis and devising therapeutic approaches, particularly for inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) which is usually diagnosed at advance stages and progresses rapidly. Genomic alterations in tumor tissue samples were studied using Foundation One™. Single CTCs were isolated using CellSearch followed by single-cell isolation by DEPArray™. Samples with 20 or more CTCs were chosen to isolate single CTCs using the DEPArray™. Genomic alterations were studied in primary tumor or metastatic sites from 32 IBC patients. Genes with high-frequency mutations were as follows: TP53 (69%), RB1 (16%), PIK3CA (13%), and also ErbB2 (3%). At least once during treatment, CTCs were detected in 26 patients with metastatic IBC, in two patients with locally advanced IBC, and four patients had no detectable CTCs. Per 7.5 mL of blood, fifteen patients (47%) had ≥20 CTCs and six of them were chosen at random to isolate single CTCs. These cells were tested for the presence of TP53, RB1, PIK3CA, and/or ErbB2 mutations previously found in matching tissue biopsies. The isolated CTCs showed the same mutations as primary or metastatic tumor samples. Intra-patient CTC heterogeneity was found by the presence of different CTC subclones, with some CTCs harboring different combinations of mutated and wild-type genes. Our results indicate that CTCs could represent a non-invasive source of cancer cells from which to determine genetic markers as the disease progresses and identify potential therapeutic targets in IBC patients.	4
Stathmin regulates mutant p53 stability and transcriptional activity in ovarian cancer. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Calcium-Binding Proteins Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Survival Female Humans Mice Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Phosphorylation Protein Binding Protein Stability RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering Stathmin Transplantation, Heterologous Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Stathmin is a p53-target gene, frequently overexpressed in late stages of human cancer progression. Type II High Grade Epithelial Ovarian Carcinomas (HG-EOC) represents the only clear exception to this observation. Here, we show that stathmin expression is necessary for the survival of HG-EOC cells carrying a p53 mutant (p53(MUT) ) gene. At molecular level, stathmin favours the binding and the phosphorylation of p53(MUT) by DNA-PKCS , eventually modulating p53(MUT) stability and transcriptional activity. Inhibition of stathmin or DNA-PKCS impaired p53(MUT) -dependent transcription of several M phase regulators, resulting in M phase failure and EOC cell death, both in vitro and in vivo. In primary human EOC a strong correlation exists between stathmin, DNA-PKCS , p53(MUT) overexpression and its transcriptional targets, further strengthening the relevance of the new pathway here described. Overall our data support the hypothesis that the expression of stathmin and p53 could be useful for the identification of high risk patients that will benefit from a therapy specifically acting on mitotic cancer cells.	0
[Detection of exon 7 mutations of PAH gene in classical phenylketonuria by high-resolution melting analysis]. ||  || To establish a simple, rapid, inexpensive and sensitive method for detecting hot region for mutations in exon 7 of PAH gene. High-resolution melting (HRM) technology was used to detect a c.728G>A mutation in exon 7 in 88 patients with classical type phenylketonuria. Suspected mutations were validated by direct DNA sequencing. The results detected by HRM are in good agreement with the results obtained by direct sequencing. HRM analysis is a simple, rapid, inexpensive and sensitive method for detecting hot mutational region in exon 7 of PAH gene.	1 3
Mutant p53 promotes ovarian cancer cell adhesion to mesothelial cells via integrin β4 and Akt signals. || Amino Acid Substitution Cell Adhesion Epithelium Female Humans Integrin beta4 MCF-7 Cells Mutation, Missense Ovarian Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Missense mutations in the TP53 gene resulting in the accumulation of mutant proteins are extremely common in advanced ovarian cancer, which is characterised by peritoneal metastasis. Attachment of cancer cells to the peritoneal mesothelium is regarded as an initial, key step for the metastatic spread of ovarian cancer. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of a p53 mutant in the mesothelial adhesion of ovarian cancer cells. We found that OVCAR-3 cells with the R248 TP53 mutation (p53(R248)) were more adhesive to mesothelial Met5A cells than were A2780 cells expressing wild-type p53. In addition, ectopic expression of p53(R248) in p53-null SKOV-3 cells significantly increased adhesion to Met5A cells. Knockdown of mutant p53 significantly compromised p53(R248)-induced cell adhesion to Met5A cells. Microarray analysis revealed that several adhesion-related genes, including integrin β4, were markedly up-regulated, and certain signalling pathways, including PI3K/Akt, were activated in p53(R248) transfectants of SKOV-3 cells. Inhibition of integrin β4 and Akt signalling using blocking antibody and the inhibitor LY294002, respectively, significantly attenuated p53(R248)-mediated ovarian cancer-mesothelial adhesion. These data suggest that the p53(R248) mutant endows ovarian cancer cells with increased adhesiveness and that integrin β4 and Akt signalling are associated with the mutation-enhanced ovarian cancer-mesothelial cell adhesion.	0
Small molecule compounds targeting the p53 pathway: are we finally making progress? || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Proliferation Drug Discovery Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Signal Transduction Small Molecule Libraries Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Loss of function of p53, either through mutations in the gene or through mutations to other members of the pathway that inactivate wild-type p53, remains a critically important aspect of human cancer development. As such, p53 remains the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. For these reasons, pharmacologic activation of the p53 pathway has been a highly sought after, yet unachieved goal in developmental therapeutics. Recently progress has been made not only in the discovery of small molecules that target wild-type and mutant p53, but also in the initiation and completion of the first in-human clinical trials for several of these drugs. Here, we review the current literature of drugs that target wild-type and mutant p53 with a focus on small-molecule type compounds. We discuss common means of drug discovery and group them according to their common mechanisms of action. Lastly, we review the current status of the various drugs in the development process and identify newer areas of p53 tumor biology that may prove therapeutically useful.	0
Mutations in EBF3 Disturb Transcriptional Profiles and Cause Intellectual Disability, Ataxia, and Facial Dysmorphism. || Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Substitution Ataxia Child Child, Preschool Chromatin Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Developmental Disabilities Exome Face Female Gene Expression Regulation Genes, Reporter HEK293 Cells Humans Intellectual Disability Language Development Disorders Male Models, Molecular Mosaicism Mutation Neurodevelopmental Disorders Protein Transport Syndrome Transcription Factors Transcription, Genetic || From a GeneMatcher-enabled international collaboration, we identified ten individuals affected by intellectual disability, speech delay, ataxia, and facial dysmorphism and carrying a deleterious EBF3 variant detected by whole-exome sequencing. One 9-bp duplication and one splice-site, five missense, and two nonsense variants in EBF3 were found; the mutations occurred de novo in eight individuals, and the missense variant c.625C>T (p.Arg209Trp) was inherited by two affected siblings from their healthy mother, who is mosaic. EBF3 belongs to the early B cell factor family (also known as Olf, COE, or O/E) and is a transcription factor involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation. Structural assessment predicted that the five amino acid substitutions have damaging effects on DNA binding of EBF3. Transient expression of EBF3 mutant proteins in HEK293T cells revealed mislocalization of all but one mutant in the cytoplasm, as well as nuclear localization. By transactivation assays, all EBF3 mutants showed significantly reduced or no ability to activate transcription of the reporter gene CDKN1A, and in situ subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that EBF3 mutant proteins were less tightly associated with chromatin. Finally, in RNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments, EBF3 acted as a transcriptional regulator, and mutant EBF3 had reduced genome-wide DNA binding and gene-regulatory activity. Our findings demonstrate that variants disrupting EBF3-mediated transcriptional regulation cause intellectual disability and developmental delay and are present in ∼0.1% of individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders.	4
TAp63alpha indirectly regulates a cutaneous HPV promoter through complex formation with Jun family members. || Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor DNA-Binding Proteins Down-Regulation Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Humans Immunoprecipitation Papillomaviridae Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun Trans-Activators Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The p63alpha isoforms of the p53 family have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the development and differentiation of the skin. We show that expression of the TAp63alpha isoform leads to an upregulation of the cutaneous papillomavirus HPV 20 promoter, which is increased at least three-fold when c-Jun is co-expressed, in contrast to a minimal increase in activity in the presence of c-Jun alone. Co-expression of TAp63alpha with JunB or JunD, respectively, and in combination, leads to a reduction in the viral promoter activation measured by the expression of TAp63alpha alone. JunB and JunD also inhibits the additive effect exerted on the TAp63alpha activation by c-Jun. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate a complex formation of c-Jun, JunB and JunD with TAp63alpha through the SAM domain mediating protein-protein interactions, which is characteristic for p63alpha. Co-expression of p53 mutant R248W not only downregulates the differential modulation of the viral promoter by TAp63alpha alone and in the presence of the Jun family members, but leads to a reduction in the protein levels of the overexpressed c-Jun, JunB, JunD, as well as TAp63alpha. This model system provides insight into yet unknown pathways through which TAp63alpha and Jun may cooperate in the pathogenesis of HPV associated cutaneous lesions.	0
Keratinocyte differentiation induces APOBEC3A, 3B, and mitochondrial DNA hypermutation. ||  || Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are found in many types of cancers and suspected to be involved in carcinogenesis, although the mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, we report that consecutive C-to-T mutations (hypermutations), a unique feature of mutations induced by APOBECs, are found in mtDNA from cervical dysplasia and oropharyngeal cancers. In vitro, we found that APOBEC3A (A3A) and 3B (A3B) expression, as well as mtDNA hypermutation, were induced in a cervical dysplastic cell line W12 when cultured in a differentiating condition. The ectopic expression of A3A or A3B was sufficient to hypermutate mtDNA. Fractionation of W12 cell lysates and immunocytochemical analysis revealed that A3A and A3B could be contained in mitochondrion. These results suggest that mtDNA hypermutation is induced upon keratinocyte differentiation, and shed light on its molecular mechanism, which involves A3s. The possible involvement of mtDNA hypermutations in carcinogenesis is also discussed.	0
Two cases of diabetic ketoacidosis in HNF1A-MODY linked to severe dehydration: is it time to change the diagnostic criteria for MODY? || Adolescent Adult Dehydration Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Diabetic Ketoacidosis Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Humans Male Young Adult || Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by heterozygous mutations in HNF1A. Currently, a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an exclusion criterion for genetic testing for MODY. In this article, we describe two unrelated patients aged 17 and 24 years with severe DKA developed several years after the diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY. Both patients were treated with insulin, but their metabolic control was poor (HbA1c 15%, 140 mmol/mol and 13%, 119 mmol/mol, respectively) due to noncompliance and missed insulin injections. In both patients, DKA followed a course of recurrent vomiting with dehydration and prerenal acute kidney injury. Their glycemia, blood pH, and base excess at admission were 97 mmol/L [1,748 mg/dL], 6.80, and -33 mmol/L (patient 1) and 34 mmol/L [613 mg/dL], 7.03, and -14 mmol/L (patient 2). This anecdotal observation supports the notion that a history of DKA does not exclude MODY.	4
Inherited Disease Genetics Improves the Identification of Cancer-Associated Genes. || Activin Receptors, Type I Amino Acid Sequence Cell Line Collagen Type III Computational Biology Databases, Genetic Endometrial Neoplasms Exome Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation HEK293 Cells Humans Lung Neoplasms Melanoma Mutation Noonan Syndrome Phosphorylation SOS1 Protein || The identification of biologically significant variants in cancer genomes is critical to therapeutic discovery, but it is limited by the statistical power needed to discern driver from passenger. Independent biological data can be used to filter cancer exomes and increase statistical power. Large genetic databases for inherited diseases are uniquely suited to this task because they contain specific amino acid alterations with known pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms. However, no rigorous method to overlay this information onto the cancer exome exists. Here, we present a computational methodology that overlays any variant database onto the somatic mutations in all cancer exomes. We validate the computation experimentally and identify novel associations in a re-analysis of 7362 cancer exomes. This analysis identified activating SOS1 mutations associated with Noonan syndrome as significantly altered in melanoma and the first kinase-activating mutations in ACVR1 associated with adult tumors. Beyond a filter, significant variants found in both rare cancers and rare inherited diseases increase the unmet medical need for therapeutics that target these variants and may bootstrap drug discovery efforts in orphan indications.	4
Effect of Y220C mutation on p53 and its rescue mechanism: a computer chemistry approach. || Computational Biology Humans Hydrogen Bonding Models, Molecular Mutation, Missense Protein Stability Static Electricity Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutation causes inactivation of 'p53' tumor suppressor protein in almost fifty percent of cancers in humans. Outside the DNA-binding surface of p53, Y220C is the most common cancerous mutation. Previous studies have shown that a surface cavity is created by this mutation which destabilizes p53. PhiKan083, a carbazole derivative capable of binding with that cavity, and slows down its thermal denaturation rate. We investigated, theoretically, on mechanisms of structural stability loss due to Y220C mutation and mechanisms of stability restoration by PhiKan083 at the atomic level. From this study it is found that in Tp53C, Tyr220 has five electrostatic interactions with residues Val 147, Prol51, Pro153 and Pro223 located on S3/S4 loop and S7/S8 loop. The S7/S8 loop is stabilized by these electrostatic interactions. Due to the Y220C mutation all these electrostatic interactions are lost. As a result the structural fluctuation occurs at S7/S8 loop, and the loop is displaced from its original position after 6 ns MD simulation. When PhiKan083 is present (inserted) at the mutation site it provides five electrostatic interactions with Pro155, Glu221 and Thr230, and two hydrogen bonds with Leu145 and Asp228, respectively. These interactions provided by Pkikan083 stabilized the S7/S8 loop, and as a result it couldn't be displaced. Our results showed that due to Y220C mutation p53 became destabilized through structural fluctuations surrounding the mutation site. When PhiKan083 is present at the Y220C mutation site (in 2vuk), it provides electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions among residue-220, its neighboring residues and PhiKan08. These interactions give additional stability to Y220C mutant p53, thus Y220C mutant p53 doesn't destabilize.	0
Targeting the mTOR Complex by Everolimus in NRAS Mutant Neuroblastoma. || Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line, Tumor Drug Delivery Systems Everolimus Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Membrane Proteins Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Morpholines Mutation Neuroblastoma Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein Kinase Inhibitors Signal Transduction TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases || High-risk neuroblastoma remains lethal in about 50% of patients despite multimodal treatment. Recent attempts to identify molecular targets for specific therapies have shown that Neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) is significantly mutated in a small number of patients. However, few inhibitors for the potential treatment for NRAS mutant neuroblastoma have been investigated so far. In this in-vitro study, we show that MEK inhibitors AZD6244, MEK162 and PD0325901 block cell growth in NRAS mutant neuroblastoma cell lines but not in NRAS wild-type cell lines. Several studies show that mutant NRAS leads to PI3K pathway activation and combined inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR effectively block cell growth. However, we observed the combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K or AKT inhibitors did not show synergestic effects on cell growth. Thus, we tested single mTOR inhibitors Everolimus and AZD8055. Interestingly, Everolimus and AZD8055 alone were sufficient to block cell growth in NRAS mutant cell lines but not in wild-type cell lines. We found that Everolimus alone induced apoptosis in NRAS mutant neuroblastoma. Furthermore, the combination of mTOR and MEK inhibitors resulted in synergistic growth inhibition. Taken together, our results show that NRAS mutant neuroblastoma can be targeted by clinically available Everolimus alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors which could impact future clinical studies.	0
Determination of somatic oncogenic mutations linked to target-based therapies using MassARRAY technology. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms Precision Medicine Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization || Somatic mutation analysis represents a useful tool in selecting personalized therapy. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of common genetic events affecting actionable oncogenes using a MassARRAY technology in patients with advanced solid tumors who were potential candidates for target-based therapies. The analysis of 238 mutations across 19 oncogenes was performed in 197 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of different tumors using the OncoCarta Panel v1.0 (Sequenom Hamburg, Germany). Of the 197 specimens, 97 (49.2%) presented at least one mutation. Forty-nine different oncogenic mutations in 16 genes were detected. Mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA were detected in 40/97 (41.2%) and 30/97 (30.9%) patients respectively. Thirty-one patients (32.0%) had mutations in two genes, 20 of them (64.5%) initially diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The co-occurrence of mutation involved mainly KRAS, PIK3CA, KIT and RET. Mutation profiles were validated using a customized panel and the Junior Next-Generation Sequencing technology (GS-Junior 454, Roche). Twenty-eight patients participated in early clinical trials or received specific treatments according to the molecular characterization (28.0%). MassARRAY technology is a rapid and effective method for identifying key cancer-driving mutations across a large number of samples, which allows for a more appropriate selection for personalized therapies.	4
Regulatory Mechanisms and Novel Therapeutic Targeting Strategies for Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases. || Allosteric Regulation Animals Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6 Humans Oxidation-Reduction Phosphorylation Protein Multimerization Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases Reactive Oxygen Species Signal Transduction || An appropriate level of protein phosphorylation on tyrosine is essential for cells to react to extracellular stimuli and maintain cellular homeostasis. Faulty operation of signal pathways mediated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation causes numerous human diseases, which presents enormous opportunities for therapeutic intervention. While the importance of protein tyrosine kinases in orchestrating the tyrosine phosphorylation networks and in target-based drug discovery has long been recognized, the significance of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in cellular signaling and disease biology has historically been underappreciated, due to a large extent to an erroneous assumption that they are largely constitutive and housekeeping enzymes. Here, we provide a comprehensive examination of a number of regulatory mechanisms, including redox modulation, allosteric regulation, and protein oligomerization, that control PTP activity. These regulatory mechanisms are integral to the myriad PTP-mediated biochemical events and reinforce the concept that PTPs are indispensable and specific modulators of cellular signaling. We also discuss how disruption of these PTP regulatory mechanisms can cause human diseases and how these diverse regulatory mechanisms can be exploited for novel therapeutic development.	0

Here, we investigated the effects of Cud C on cell proliferation, caspase activation andapoptosis induction in colorectal cancer cells (CRC). We show that Cud C inhibits cell proliferation in KM12, Caco-2, HT29, HCC2998, HCT116 and SW48 CRC but not in the non-transformed colorectal epithelial cells, CCD CoN 841. Cud C induces tumor-selective apoptosis via mitochondrial depolarization and activation of the intrinsic caspase pathway. Gene expression profiling by microarray analyses revealed that tumor suppressor genes EGR1, HUWE1 and SMG1 were significantly up-regulated while oncogenes such as MYB1, CCNB1 and GPX2 were down-regulated following treatment with Cud C. Further analyses using Connectivity Map revealed that Cud C induced a gene signature highly similar to that of protein synthesis inhibitors and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT inhibitors, suggesting that Cud C might inhibit PI3K-AKT signaling. A luminescent cell free PI3K lipid kinase assay revealed that Cud C significantly inhibited p110β/p85α PI3K activity, followed by p120γ, p110δ/p85α, and p110α/p85α PI3K activities. The inhibition by Cud C on p110β/p85α PI3K activity was comparable to LY-294002, a known PI3K inhibitor. Cud C also inhibited phosphorylation of AKT independent of NFκB activity in CRC cells, while ectopic expression of myristoylated AKT completely abrogated the anti-proliferative effects, and apoptosis induced by Cud C in CRC. These findings demonstrate that Cud C induces tumor-selective cytotoxicity by targeting the PI3K-AKT pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of Cud C, and indicate that Cud C further development of Cud C derivatives as potential therapeutic agents is warranted.	0
P53 mutants suppress ZBP-89 function. || Animals Colonic Neoplasms DNA-Binding Proteins Genes, p53 HCT116 Cells Humans Point Mutation Rats Transcription Factors Transcriptional Activation Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || ZBP-89 is a widely expressed Krüppel-type zinc finger transcription factor that binds to GC-rich elements and represses or activates known target genes. ZBP-89 stabilizes wild-type p53 and can induce apoptosis independently of p53. Tissues with p53 mutations are predisposed to transformation and are more resistant to chemotherapy. The effect of ZBP-89 on seven sporadic p53 mutants was investigated. It was then examined whether a cell null for p53 in comparison to one expressing mutated p53 is more sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy in the presence of increased levels of ZBP-89. None of the p53 mutations were stabilized by ZBP-89 except for the A161T p53 mutation, which exhibited constitutive transcriptional activity. ZBP-89 potentiated p53-mediated cell death with 10 nM staurosporine and 100 nM etoposide, but did not in the presence of the R273H p53 mutation. ZBP-89 is an important co-activator of wild-type p53 and both proteins are negatively affected by functionally inactive p53 mutants.	0
Reversion of resistance to oxaliplatin by inhibition of p38 MAPK in colorectal cancer cell lines: involvement of the calpain / Nox1 pathway. ||  || Oxaliplatin is a major treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, however its effectiveness is greatly diminished by the development of resistances. Our previous work has shown that oxaliplatin efficacy depends on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by Nox1. In this report, we investigated Nox1 involvement in the survival mechanisms of oxaliplatin resistant cell lines that we have selected. Our results show that basal ROS production by Nox1 is increased in resistant cells. Whereas the transitory Nox1-dependent production of superoxide contributes to the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin in sensitive cells, oxaliplatin treatment of resistant cells leads to a decrease in the production of superoxide associated with an increase of H2O2 and a decreased cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin. We have shown that calpains regulate differently Nox1 according to the sensitivity of the cells to oxaliplatin. In sensitive cells, calpains inhibit Nox1 by cleaving NoxA1 leading to a transient ROS production necessary for oxaliplatin cytotoxic effects. In contrast, in resistant cells calpain activation is associated with an increase of Nox1 activity through Src kinases, inducing a strong and maintained ROS production responsible for cell survival. Using a kinomic study we have shown that this overactivation of Nox1 results in an increase of p38 MAPK activity allowing the resistant cells to escape apoptosis. Our results show that the modulation of Nox1 activity in the context of anticancer treatment remains complex. However, a strategy to maximize Nox1 activation while inhibiting the p38 MAPK-dependent escape routes appears to be an option of choice to optimize oxaliplatin efficiency.	0
The p53 tetramer shows an induced-fit interaction of the C-terminal domain with the DNA-binding domain. || Binding Sites Crystallography, X-Ray DNA Humans Kinetics Models, Molecular Mutation Nucleic Acid Conformation Protein Binding Protein Multimerization Protein Stability Protein Structure, Secondary Protein Structure, Tertiary Static Electricity Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The Trp53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in all human cancers. Its protein product p53 is a very powerful transcription factor that can activate different biochemical pathways and affect the regulation of metabolism, senescence, DNA damage response, cell cycle and cell death. The understanding of its function at the molecular level could be of pivotal relevance for therapy. Investigation of long-range intra- and interdomain communications in the p53 tetramer-DNA complex was performed by means of an atomistic model that included the tetramerization helices in the C-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domains and a consensus DNA-binding site of 18 base pairs. Nonsymmetric dynamics are illustrated in the four DNA-binding domains, with loop L1 switching from inward to outward conformations with respect to the DNA major groove. Direct intra- and intermonomeric long-range communications between the tetramerization and DNA-binding domains are noted. These long-distance conformational changes link the C terminus with the DNA-binding domain and provide a biophysical rationale for the reported functional regulation of the p53 C-terminal region. A fine characterization of the DNA deformation caused by p53 binding is obtained, with 'static' deformations always present and measured by the slide parameter in the central thymine-adenine base pairs; we also detect 'dynamic' deformations switched on and off by particular p53 tetrameric conformations and measured by the roll and twist parameters in the same base pairs. These different conformations can indeed modulate the electrostatic potential isosurfaces of the whole p53-DNA complex. These results provide a molecular/biophysical understanding of the evident role of the C terminus in post-translational modification that regulates the transcriptional function of p53. Furthermore, the unstructured C terminus is able to facilitate contacts between the core DNA-binding domains of the tetramer.	0
[DNA diagnosis in congenital and early childhood hypoacusis and deafness]. ||  || Congenital deafness affects 0.05-0.1% children. 90% of them were born from parents with normal hearing. There were no hearing defects in their families. In 70% of deafness cases deafness is the only symptom of the disease and is thought to be non-syndromal. Hypoacusis of unclear etiology may be congenital in 50% cases. Half of cases of severe autosomic-recessive non-syndromal hypoacusis (deafness) appear because of changes in only one gene--gene of connexine-26. Two thirds of the defects in this gene arise because of one mutation--35delG. Mean rate of this mutation carriage in Russia is over 2%. Identification of mutation 35delG in gene Cx26 is performed with the use of polymerase chain reaction. Genetic examination of 75 children with isolated hypoacusis (deafness) has detected deletion 35delG in both gene copies in 23 children (30%). 10 patients (13.4%) had mutation 35delG only in one copy of gene Cx26. Hearing defects in the latter may be related with the presence of another mutation in the same gene. A total of 33 patients (42%) carried deletion 35delG. According to our findings, the changed genotype is characterized primarily by bilateral neurosensory hypoacusis of the third-fourth degree. Weaker loss of hearing is rare. Thus, mutations in connexine gene26 present a problem for parents with normal hearing. Therefore, families with a deaf child should be referred for medicogenetic consultations.	4
A spiroligomer α-helix mimic that binds HDM2, penetrates human cells and stabilizes HDM2 in cell culture. || Binding Sites Biological Transport Cell Line, Tumor Diffusion Feedback, Physiological Gene Expression Hepatocytes Humans Imidazoles Kinetics Models, Molecular Molecular Conformation Molecular Mimicry Piperazines Protein Binding Protein Stability Protein Structure, Tertiary Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Solid-Phase Synthesis Techniques Spiro Compounds Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We demonstrate functionalized spiroligomers that mimic the HDM2-bound conformation of the p53 activation domain. Spiroligomers are stereochemically defined, functionalized, spirocyclic monomers coupled through pairs of amide bonds to create spiro-ladder oligomers. Two series of spiroligomers were synthesized, one of structural analogs and one of stereochemical analogs, from which we identified compound 1, that binds HDM2 with a Kd value of 400 nM. The spiroligomer 1 penetrates human liver cancer cells through passive diffusion and in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner increases the levels of HDM2 more than 30-fold in Huh7 cells in which the p53/HDM2 negative feed-back loop is inoperative. This is a biological effect that is not seen with the HDM2 ligand nutlin-3a. We propose that compound 1 modulates the levels of HDM2 by stabilizing it to proteolysis, allowing it to accumulate in the absence of a p53/HDM2 feedback loop.	0
BAG3: a multifaceted protein that regulates major cell pathways. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Autophagy Cell Movement Cells Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental Humans Neoplasms Protein Binding || Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) protein is a member of BAG family of co-chaperones that interacts with the ATPase domain of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 through BAG domain (110-124 amino acids). BAG3 is the only member of the family to be induced by stressful stimuli, mainly through the activity of heat shock factor 1 on bag3 gene promoter. In addition to the BAG domain, BAG3 contains also a WW domain and a proline-rich (PXXP) repeat, that mediate binding to partners different from Hsp70. These multifaceted interactions underlie BAG3 ability to modulate major biological processes, that is, apoptosis, development, cytoskeleton organization and autophagy, thereby mediating cell adaptive responses to stressful stimuli. In normal cells, BAG3 is constitutively present in a very few cell types, including cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells, in which the protein appears to contribute to cell resistance to mechanical stress. A growing body of evidence indicate that BAG3 is instead expressed in several tumor types. In different tumor contexts, BAG3 protein was reported to sustain cell survival, resistance to therapy, and/or motility and metastatization. In some tumor types, down-modulation of BAG3 levels was shown, as a proof-of-principle, to inhibit neoplastic cell growth in animal models. This review attempts to outline the emerging mechanisms that can underlie some of the biological activities of the protein, focusing on implications in tumor progression.	0
Genomic and biological characterization of exon 4 KRAS mutations in human cancer. || Adenocarcinoma Animals Benzamides Cell Line, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms Comparative Genomic Hybridization Diphenylamine ErbB Receptors Exons Genes, ras Genotype Humans Mass Spectrometry Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Nude Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || Mutations in RAS proteins occur widely in human cancer. Prompted by the confirmation of KRAS mutation as a predictive biomarker of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies, limited clinical testing for RAS pathway mutations has recently been adopted. We performed a multiplatform genomic analysis to characterize, in a nonbiased manner, the biological, biochemical, and prognostic significance of Ras pathway alterations in colorectal tumors and other solid tumor malignancies. Mutations in exon 4 of KRAS were found to occur commonly and to predict for a more favorable clinical outcome in patients with colorectal cancer. Exon 4 KRAS mutations, all of which were identified at amino acid residues K117 and A146, were associated with lower levels of GTP-bound RAS in isogenic models. These same mutations were also often accompanied by conversion to homozygosity and increased gene copy number, in human tumors and tumor cell lines. Models harboring exon 4 KRAS mutations exhibited mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase dependence and resistance to EGFR-targeted agents. Our findings suggest that RAS mutation is not a binary variable in tumors, and that the diversity in mutant alleles and variability in gene copy number may also contribute to the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes observed in cancer patients. These results also provide a rationale for broader KRAS testing beyond the most common hotspot alleles in exons 2 and 3.	0
Fluorescent Biosensor for Detection of the R248Q Aggregation-Prone Mutant of p53. ||  || The p53 tumour suppressor and guardian of the genome undergoes missense mutations that lead to functional inactivation in 50 % of human cancers. These mutations occur mostly in the DNA-binding domain of the protein, and several of these result in conformational changes that lead to amyloid-like protein aggregation. Herein, we describe a fluorescent biosensor that reports on the R248Q mutant of p53 in vitro and in living cells, engineered through conjugation of an environmentally sensitive probe onto a peptide derived from the primary aggregation segment of p53. This biosensor was characterised both in vitro and by means of fluorescence microscopy following facilitated delivery into cultured cells. It is shown that this biosensor preferentially reports on the p53 R248Q mutant in the PC9 lung cancer cell line compared with other lung cancer cell lines harbouring either wild-type or no p53.	0
Dissecting fragment-based lead discovery at the von Hippel-Lindau protein:hypoxia inducible factor 1α protein-protein interface. || Binding Sites Crystallography, X-Ray Drug Design Drug Evaluation, Preclinical Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit Models, Chemical Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Structure, Tertiary Recombinant Proteins Small Molecule Libraries Von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein || Fragment screening is widely used to identify attractive starting points for drug design. However, its potential and limitations to assess the tractability of often challenging protein:protein interfaces have been underexplored. Here, we address this question by means of a systematic deconstruction of lead-like inhibitors of the pVHL:HIF-1α interaction into their component fragments. Using biophysical techniques commonly employed for screening, we could only detect binding of fragments that violate the Rule of Three, are more complex than those typically screened against classical druggable targets, and occupy two adjacent binding subsites at the interface rather than just one. Analyses based on ligand and group lipophilicity efficiency of anchored fragments were applied to dissect the individual subsites and probe for binding hot spots. The implications of our findings for targeting protein interfaces by fragment-based approaches are discussed.	0
Quantitative analysis of upright standing in adults with late-onset Pompe disease. || Adolescent Adult Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Models, Biological Motor Activity Postural Balance Posture || Pompe disease is a rare disorder producing muscle weakness and progressive impairments in performing daily motor activities, such as walking and standing. Most studies have focused on dysfunctions at cellular level, restricting the examination of gross motor functions to qualitative or subjective rating scales evaluations. With the aim of providing an instrumented quantification of upright standing in Pompe disease, we used a force platform to measure the center of pressure over three foot positions and with eyes open and closed. Amplitude and variability of body sway were measured to determine the level of postural stability, while power spectrum analysis and nonlinear computations were performed to explore the structure of the postural control. In comparison with healthy participants, patients with Pompe disease showed a reduced level of postural stability, but irrelevant variations in frequency content and spatio-temporal structure of the sway motion were detected. Changes in foot position did not increase the postural instability associated with Pompe disease, but prominent worsening occurred in the patients when they stand with eyes closed, particularly along the anterior-posterior direction. These results provide objective elements to monitor deficiencies of upright standing in Pompe disease, emphasizing the specific contributions of sway direction and sensory deficits.	1
Complete spectrum of PAH mutations in Tataria: presence of Slavic, Turkic and Scandinavian mutations. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Although the molecular lesions present in the PAH genes of PKU patients have previously been determined in several Slavic populations, little is known regarding the molecular basis of PKU in the non-Slavic populations of the former Soviet Union. Guthrie card samples from twenty-one classical PKU patients residing in the Tatarian Republic were examined by a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequence analysis. Twelve patients were of Tatarian ancestry, five were of Russian ancestry, and four were of mixed Tatarian and Russian ancestry. Two of the Tatarian patients were related, sharing one mutant allele. The single major allele identified in this study was R408W/RFLP haplotype 2/VNTR 3, which was present on 11/14 or 78.6% of all mutant chromosomes of Slavic origin, but on only 10/27 or 37.0% of mutant chromosomes of Tatarian origin. This result suggests that this allele was introduced into central Asian populations during the eastward expansion of Slavs across the Eurasian landmass. A significant influence of Turkic peoples on Tatars can be inferred from the presence of R261Q. IVS10nt546g --> a, L48S, IVS2nt5g --> c and P281L, all of which are relatively common among Turks or have been observed in Mediterranean populations. Together, these alleles are present on 11/27 or 40.7% of all mutant chromosomes in ethnic Tatars. Surprisingly, the common Scandinavian mutation IVS12ntlg --> a was also present in Tataria, as was the delta agE221D222fs mutation found previously only in Denmark. Thus, some direct or indirect gene flow from Scandinavian into Tataria seems evident. Finally, the complete absence of PAH mutations previously observed in Oriental populations suggests that there was little gene flow into Tataria from Eastern Asia.	1 3
Intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity and alternative driver genetic alterations in breast cancers with heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone Female Gene Amplification Gene Dosage Humans MCF-7 Cells Mutation Receptor, ErbB-2 Signal Transduction Transcription Factor TFIIIB || HER2 is overexpressed and amplified in approximately 15% of invasive breast cancers, and is the molecular target and predictive marker of response to anti-HER2 agents. In a subset of these cases, heterogeneous distribution of HER2 gene amplification can be found, which creates clinically challenging scenarios. Currently, breast cancers with HER2 amplification/overexpression in just over 10% of cancer cells are considered HER2-positive for clinical purposes; however, it is unclear as to whether the HER2-negative components of such tumors would be driven by distinct genetic alterations. Here we sought to characterize the pathologic and genetic features of the HER2-positive and HER2-negative components of breast cancers with heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification and to define the repertoire of potential driver genetic alterations in the HER2-negative components of these cases. We separately analyzed the HER2-negative and HER2-positive components of 12 HER2 heterogeneous breast cancers using gene copy number profiling and massively parallel sequencing, and identified potential driver genetic alterations restricted to the HER2-negative cells in each case. In vitro experiments provided functional evidence to suggest that BRF2 and DSN1 overexpression/amplification, and the HER2 I767M mutation may be alterations that compensate for the lack of HER2 amplification in the HER2-negative components of HER2 heterogeneous breast cancers. Our results indicate that even driver genetic alterations, such as HER2 gene amplification, can be heterogeneously distributed within a cancer, and that the HER2-negative components are likely driven by genetic alterations not present in the HER2-positive components, including BRF2 and DSN1 amplification and HER2 somatic mutations.	4
Silent exonic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene that cause familial hypercholesterolemia by affecting mRNA splicing. || Adolescent Adult Aged Exons Female Genetic Variation Humans Hypercholesterolemia Male Middle Aged Mutation RNA Splicing Receptors, LDL || In a large group of patients with the clinical phenotype of familial hypercholesterolemia, such as elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and premature atherosclerosis, but without functional mutations in the genes coding for the LDL receptor and apolipoprotein B, we examined the effect of 128 seemingly neutral exonic and intronic DNA variants, discovered by routine sequencing of these genes. Two variants, G186G and R385R, were found to be associated with altered splicing. The nucleotide change leading to G186G resulted in the generation of new 3'-splice donor site in exon 4 and R385R was associated with a new 5'-splice acceptor site in exon 9 of the LDL receptor gene. Splicing of these alternate splice sites leads to an in-frame 75-base pair deletion in a stable mRNA of exon 4 in case of G186G and R385R resulted in a 31-base pair frame-shift deletion in exon 9 and non-sense-mediated mRNA decay.	4
Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease. || Age of Onset Alzheimer Disease Disease Progression Humans || Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD), with onset in individuals younger than 65 years, although overshadowed by the more common late-onset AD (LOAD), differs significantly from LOAD. EOAD comprises approximately 5% of AD and is associated with delays in diagnosis, aggressive course, and age-related psychosocial needs. One source of confusion is that a substantial percentage of EOAD are phenotypic variants that differ from the usual memory-disordered presentation of typical AD. The management of EOAD is similar to that for LOAD, but special emphasis should be placed on targeting the specific cognitive areas involved and more age-appropriate psychosocial support and education.	4
Intracellular Domain Contacts Contribute to Ecadherin Constitutive Dimerization in the Plasma Membrane. || Cadherins Calcium Cell Line Cell Membrane DNA Mutational Analysis Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Humans Protein Multimerization || Epithelial cadherin (Ecadherin) is responsible for the intercellular cohesion of epithelial tissues. It forms lateral clusters within adherens cell-cell junctions, but its association state outside these clusters is unknown. Here, we use a quantitative Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach to show that Ecadherin forms constitutive dimers and that these dimers exist independently of the actin cytoskeleton or cytoplasmic proteins. The dimers are stabilized by intermolecular contacts that occur along the entire length of Ecadherin, with the intracellular domains having a surprisingly strong favorable contribution. We further show that Ecadherin mutations and calcium depletion induce structural alterations that propagate from the N terminus all the way to the C terminus, without destabilizing the dimeric state. These findings provide context for the interpretation of Ecadherin adhesion experiments. They also suggest that early events of adherens junction assembly involve interactions between from preformed Ecadherin dimers.	0
Prevalence of DFNB1 mutations among cochlear implant users in Slovakia and its clinical implications. || Cochlear Implantation Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Deafness European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genotype Humans Male Mutation Slovakia || Hereditary etiology plays an important role in bilateral profound deafness as a main indication for cochlear implantation. Mutations in DFNB1 locus account for most of the inherited deafness cases in Caucasians. To provide actual data on mutation prevalence among implanted deaf subpopulation, we performed DNA analysis of GJB2 and GJB6 genes in 131 unrelated Slovak cochlear implant users. Eight previously described causal mutations and one probably pathogenic missense variant (c.127G>A) were detected in the GJB2 gene in 58 (44.28%) subjects. The most common mutation found was c.35delG with frequency 83.02% of all disease alleles, followed by c.71G>A, c.1-3201G>A, c.313_326del14, c.109G>A, 167delT, c.269T>C, and c.333_334delAA. GJB6 deletion delD13S1830 was identified in only one subject, in double heterozygosity with a GJB6 mutation. Thus, the deafness cause could be clearly attributable to DFNB1 mutations in 36.64% of the patients examined. In summary, the mutation profile found in our cohort was similar to the mutation spectrum reported for Central European deaf populations. The mutation prevalence in cochlear implant users was, however, almost by 25% higher than previously established for non-implanted hearing-impaired population in Slovakia. Finally, we also demonstrate a certain variability in deafness onset in patients with causal genotype and coincidence with other risk factors for deafness. Our results underline the importance of genetic tests in all cochlear implant candidates.	4
Low incidence of GJB2, GJB6 and mitochondrial DNA mutations in North Indian patients with non-syndromic hearing impairment. || Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Hearing Loss, Bilateral Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Incidence India Male Mutation || Mutations at the DFNB1 locus which encode connexin 26 (CX26) and connexin 30 (CX30) proteins, respectively, are main cause for sporadic and familial non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) in many populations. 342-kb deletion [del (GJB6-D13S1830)] of Cx30 gene is second most common connexin mutation. Specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been found to be associated with NSHI. In this study, we screened 210 NSHI patients for GJB2 mutations, DeltaGJB6-D13S1830 deletion and three point mutations in mtDNA (A1555G, A3243G, A7445G) using PCR, DHPLC and sequencing in North Indian cohort. 35delG was found to be the most common mutation (10.9%), followed by W24X (3.8%) and W77X (1.9%) mutations. We did not observe GJB6-D13S1830 deletion and three mitochondrial point mutations in our cohort. Most of patients (50/58) carried monoallelic variations. Our results reveal different spectrum of GJB2 mutations specific to North Indian cohort, with 35delG being most prevalent. These results suggest that different types of GJB2 mutations affect autosomal recessive NSHI according to ethnic background.	4
Regulation of nucleotide metabolism by mutant p53 contributes to its gain-of-function activities. || Animals Blotting, Western Brain Neoplasms Breast Neoplasms Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Deoxycytidine Kinase Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockdown Techniques Guanosine Triphosphate Humans Immunoprecipitation Kaplan-Meier Estimate Mice Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Transplantation Nucleosides Nucleotides Prognosis Promoter Regions, Genetic Proportional Hazards Models Tumor Stem Cell Assay Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutant p53 (mtp53) is an oncogene that drives cancer cell proliferation. Here we report that mtp53 associates with the promoters of numerous nucleotide metabolism genes (NMG). Mtp53 knockdown reduces NMG expression and substantially depletes nucleotide pools, which attenuates GTP-dependent protein activity and cell invasion. Addition of exogenous guanosine or GTP restores the invasiveness of mtp53 knockdown cells, suggesting that mtp53 promotes invasion by increasing GTP. In addition, mtp53 creates a dependency on the nucleoside salvage pathway enzyme deoxycytidine kinase for the maintenance of a proper balance in dNTP pools required for proliferation. These data indicate that mtp53-harbouring cells have acquired a synthetic sick or lethal phenotype relationship with the nucleoside salvage pathway. Finally, elevated expression of NMG correlates with mutant p53 status and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, mtp53's control of nucleotide biosynthesis has both a driving and sustaining role in cancer development.	0
Implantable Loop Recorder Monitoring for Refining Management of Children With Inherited Arrhythmia Syndromes. || Adolescent Arrhythmias, Cardiac Child Child, Preschool Death, Sudden, Cardiac Female Humans Male Monitoring, Ambulatory Prostheses and Implants Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome || Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are conventionally utilized to elucidate the mechanism of atypical syncope. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of these devices on management of pediatric patients with known or suspected inherited arrhythmia syndromes. A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all pediatric patients with known or suspected inherited arrhythmia syndromes in whom an ILR was implanted from 2008 to 2015. Captured data included categorization of diagnosis, treatment, transmitted tracings, and the impact of ILR tracings on management. Transmissions were categorized as symptomatic, autotriggered, or routine. Actionable transmissions were abnormal tracings that directly resulted in a change of medical or device therapy. A total of 20 patients met the stated inclusion criteria (long QT syndrome, n=8, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,n=9, Brugada syndrome, n=1, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, n=2), with 60% of patients being genotype positive. Primary indication for implantation of ILR included ongoing monitoring +/- symptoms (n=15, 75%), suspicion of noncompliance (n=1, 5%), and liberalization of recommended activity restrictions (n=4, 25%). A total of 172 transmissions were received in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes, with 7% yielding actionable data. The majority (52%) of symptom events were documented in the long QT syndrome population, with only 1 tracing (5%) yielding actionable data. Automatic transmissions were mostly seen in the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cohort (81%), with 21% yielding actionable data. There was no actionable data in routine transmissions. ILRs in patients with suspected or confirmed inherited arrhythmia syndromes may be useful for guiding management. Findings escalated therapies in 30% of subjects. As importantly, in this high-risk population, the majority of symptom events represented normal or benign rhythms, reassuring patients and physicians that no further intervention was required.	4
Recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Mexican women with breast cancer. || Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms Case-Control Studies Female Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Germ-Line Mutation Humans Mexico Middle Aged || Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes confer an estimated 58% to 80% lifetime risk of breast cancer. In general, screening is done for cancer patients if a relative has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. There are few data on the prevalence of mutations in these genes in Mexican women with breast cancer and this hampers efforts to develop screening policies in Mexico. We screened 810 unselected women with breast cancer from three cities in Mexico (Mexico City, Veracruz, and Monterrey) for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, including a panel of 26 previously reported mutations. Thirty-five mutations were identified in 34 women (4.3% of total) including 20 BRCA1 mutations and 15 BRCA2 mutations. Twenty-two of the 35 mutations were recurrent mutations (62.8%). Only five of the 34 mutation carriers had a first-degree relative with breast cancer (three with BRCA1 and two with BRCA2 mutations). These results support the rationale for a strategy of screening for recurrent mutations in all women with breast cancer in Mexico, as opposed to restricting screening to those with a sister or mother with breast or ovarian cancer. These results will impact cancer genetic testing in Mexico and the identification of at-risk individuals who will benefit from increased surveillance.

Loss of NF1 in cutaneous melanoma is associated with RAS activation and MEK dependence. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation GTP Phosphohydrolases Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1 Genes, ras Humans MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Membrane Proteins Neurofibromin 1 Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms || Melanoma is a disease characterized by lesions that activate ERK. Although 70% of cutaneous melanomas harbor activating mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes, the alterations that drive tumor progression in the remaining 30% are largely undefined. Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor of RAF kinases, has clinical utility restricted to BRAF-mutant tumors. MEK inhibitors, which have shown clinical activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma, may be effective in other ERK pathway-dependent settings. Here, we investigated a panel of melanoma cell lines wild type for BRAF and NRAS to determine the genetic alteration driving their transformation and their dependence on ERK signaling in order to elucidate a candidate set for MEK inhibitor treatment. A cohort of the BRAF/RAS wild type cell lines with high levels of RAS-GTP had loss of NF1, a RAS GTPase activating protein. In these cell lines, the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited ERK phosphorylation, but also relieved feedback inhibition of RAS, resulting in induction of pMEK and a rapid rebound in ERK signaling. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor trametinib impaired the adaptive response of cells to ERK inhibition, leading to sustained suppression of ERK signaling and significant antitumor effects. Notably, alterations in NF1 frequently co-occurred with RAS and BRAF alterations in melanoma. In the setting of BRAF(V600E), NF1 loss abrogated negative feedback on RAS activation, resulting in elevated activation of RAS-GTP and resistance to RAF, but not MEK, inhibitors. We conclude that loss of NF1 is common in cutaneous melanoma and is associated with RAS activation, MEK-dependence, and resistance to RAF inhibition.	0
Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome-associated Cx26 mutants produce nonfunctional gap junctions but hyperactive hemichannels when co-expressed with wild type Cx43. || Adenosine Triphosphate Calcium Cell Membrane Permeability Connexin 26 Connexin 43 Connexins Deafness Gap Junctions Genotype HeLa Cells Humans Ichthyosis Ion Channels Keratitis Mutation Phenotype || Mutations in Cx26 gene are found in most cases of human genetic deafness. Some mutations produce syndromic deafness associated with skin disorders, like the Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome (KID). Because in the human skin connexin 26 (Cx26) is co-expressed with other connexins, like Cx43 and Cx30, and as the KID syndrome is inherited as autosomal dominant condition, it is possible that KID mutations change the way Cx26 interacts with other co-expressed connexins. Indeed, some Cx26 syndromic mutations showed gap junction dominant negative effect when co-expressed with wild-type connexins, including Cx26 and Cx43. The nature of these interactions and the consequences on hemichannels and gap junction channel (GJC) functions remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that syndromic mutations, at the N terminus segment of Cx26, change connexin oligomerization compatibility, allowing aberrant interactions with Cx43. Strikingly, heteromeric oligomer formed by Cx43/Cx26 (syndromic mutants) shows exacerbated hemichannel activity but nonfunctional GJCs; this also occurs for those Cx26 KID mutants that do not show functional homomeric hemichannels. Heterologous expression of these hyperactive heteromeric hemichannels increases cell membrane permeability, favoring ATP release and Ca(2+) overload. The functional paradox produced by oligomerization of Cx43 and Cx26 KID mutants could underlie the severe syndromic phenotype in human skin.	0
Combined inhibition of MEK and nuclear ERK translocation has synergistic antitumor activity in melanoma cells. ||  || Genetic alterations in BRAF, NRAS and NF1 that activate the ERK cascade, account for over 80% of metastatic melanomas. However, ERK cascade inhibitors have been proven beneficial almost exclusively for BRAF mutant melanomas. One of the hallmarks of the ERK cascade is the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, which is important mainly for the induction of proliferation. This translocation can be inhibited by the NTS-derived peptide (EPE) that blocks the ERK1/2-importin7 interaction, inhibits the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, and arrests active ERK1/2 in the cytoplasm. In this study, we found that the EPE peptide significantly reduced the viability of not only BRAF, but also several NRAS and NF1 mutant melanomas. Importantly, combination of the EPE peptide and trametinib showed synergy in reducing the viability of some NRAS mutant melanomas, an effect driven by the partial preservation of negative feedback loops. The same combination significantly reduced the viability of other melanoma cells, including those resistant to mono-treatment with EPE peptide and ERK cascade inhibitors. Our study indicates that targeting the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, in combination with MEK inhibitors can be used for the treatment of different mutant melanomas.	0
Efficiency of microarray and SNPscan for the detection of hearing loss gene in 71 cases with nonsyndromic hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Genetic Testing Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Microarray Analysis Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide RNA, Ribosomal Sulfate Transporters Young Adult || We aim to screen the mutations of 3 hearing loss (HL) genes (GJB2, SLC26A4, and 12S rRNA) in 71 cases with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) using microarray and SNPscan, and identify the roles of nonhotspot mutation of these genes in the screening of NSHL. Seventy-one cases with moderate or severe neurosensory deafness confirmed in our department from July 2014 to December 2015 including 25 Uyghur minorities and 46 Han Chinese were included in this study. The type of mutations in GJB2, SLC26A4, and 12S rRNA genes were detected using microarray and SNPscan, respectively. Statistical difference was noticed in the detection rate of the HL genes in 71 cases. Using microassay, deafness genes were identified in 10 subjects (14.08%), while 22 cases (30.98%) were confirmed with the presence of deafness genes using the SNPscan. Compared with the microarray, remarkable difference was noticed in the detection rate of SNPscan (P < .05). Nonhotspot mutation in GJB2, SLC26A4, and 12S rRNA genes played a crucial role in the pathogenesis of NSHL. SNPscan contributed to elevation of detection rate of NSHL in clinical practice.	4
Tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness after extended loading test of 12 Danish PKU patients with the Y414C mutation. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by phenylalanine (Phe) accumulation due to defects in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Phe accumulation can lead to cognitive impairment. Some individuals with PKU respond to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) treatment, the natural cofactor of PAH, by a reduction in blood Phe concentrations.We tested 12 patients with PKU, 8-29 years of age, all carrying the common Y414C mutation in the PAH gene. Three were homozygous and nine were compound heterozygous, with the second mutation being a putative null mutation. During the study period, genuine protein was increased to approximately 1 g/kg. The patients were treated with 20, 10, and 5 mg BH4/kg/day for 1 week on each dose, starting with 20 mg/kg. A positive response was defined as a decline in blood Phe>30%. Blood Phe was measured four times a week. Nonresponding children were excluded from the study. Eleven of 12 patients had a positive response with 20 mg/kg, 5/10 responded on 10 mg/kg, and 1/9 on 5 mg/kg. Two were late responders, with a response on 20 mg/kg after >48 h. We could confirm the previously reported inconsistent responsiveness of Y414C in the nine heterozygous patients, whereas the three homozygous patients had early median Phe declines of 73%, 51%, and 27%, respectively, on the three different doses. The varying responses despite uniform trial conditions and genotypes may be due to individual differences in BH4 absorption or metabolism. No side effects were observed.	1 3
ERIC recommendations for TP53 mutation analysis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia-update on methodological approaches and results interpretation. || DNA Mutational Analysis Europe Genes, p53 High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell || In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), TP53 gene defects, due to deletion of the 17p13 locus and/or mutation(s) within the TP53 gene, are associated with resistance to chemoimmunotherapy and a particularly dismal clinical outcome. On these grounds, analysis of TP53 aberrations has been incorporated into routine clinical diagnostics to improve patient stratification and optimize therapeutic decisions. The predictive implications of TP53 aberrations have increasing significance in the era of novel targeted therapies, i.e., inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BcR) signaling and anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, owing to their efficacy in patients with TP53 defects. In this report, the TP53 Network of the European Research Initiative on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (ERIC) presents updated recommendations on the methodological approaches for TP53 mutation analysis. Moreover, it provides guidance to ensure that the analysis is performed in a timely manner for all patients requiring treatment and that the data is interpreted and reported in a consistent, standardized, and accurate way. Since next-generation sequencing technologies are gaining prominence within diagnostic laboratories, this report also offers advice and recommendations for the interpretation of TP53 mutation data generated by this methodology.	4
In silico analyses of the effects of a point mutation and a pharmacological chaperone on the thermal fluctuation of phenylalanine hydroxylase. || Binding Sites Catalytic Domain Crystallography, X-Ray Molecular Dynamics Simulation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Point Mutation Protein Folding Pyrimidinones Temperature || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism due to mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Recently, small compounds, known as pharmacological chaperones (PhCs), have been identified that restore the enzymatic activity of mutant PAHs. Understanding the mechanism of the reduction in enzymatic activity due to a point mutation in PAH and its restoration by PhC binding is important for the design of more effective PhC drugs. Thermal fluctuations of an enzyme can alter its activity. Here, molecular dynamics simulation show the thermal fluctuation of PAH is increased by introduction of the A313T mutation. Moreover, a simulation using the A313T-PhC complex model was also performed. Thermal fluctuation of the mutant was found to be reduced upon PhC binding, which contributes to restoring its enzymatic activity.	0
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation predictions using the BOADICEA and BRCAPRO models and penetrance estimation in high-risk French-Canadian families. || Adolescent Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms Canada DNA Mutational Analysis Female France Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Counseling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Middle Aged Models, Theoretical Ovarian Neoplasms Pedigree Predictive Value of Tests Risk Assessment Sensitivity and Specificity || Several genetic risk models for breast and ovarian cancer have been developed, but their applicability to specific populations has not been evaluated. We used data from French-Canadian families to evaluate the mutation predictions given by the BRCAPRO and BOADICEA models. We also used this data set to estimate the age-specific risks for breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. A total of 195 families with multiple affected individuals with breast or ovarian cancer were recruited through the INHERIT (INterdisciplinary HEalth Research International Team on BReast CAncer susceptibility) BRCAs research program. Observed BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status was compared with predicted carrier probabilities under the BOADICEA and BRCAPRO models. The models were assessed using Brier scores, attributes diagrams and receiver operating characteristic curves. Log relative risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers versus population risks were estimated by maximum likelihood, using a modified segregation analysis implemented in the computer program MENDEL. Twenty-five families were eligible for inclusion in the BRCA1 penetrance analysis and 27 families were eligible for the BRCA2 penetrance analysis. The BOADICEA model predicted accurately the number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations for the various groups of families, and was found to discriminate well at the individual level between carriers and noncarriers. BRCAPRO over-predicted the number of mutations in almost all groups of families, in particular the number of BRCA1 mutations. It significantly overestimated the carrier frequency for high predicted probabilities. However, it discriminated well between carriers and noncarriers. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate similar sensitivity and specificity for BRCAPRO and BOADICEA. The estimated risks for breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers were consistent with previously published estimates. The BOADICEA model predicts accurately the carrier probabilities in French-Canadian families and may be used for counselling in this population. None of the penetrance estimates was significantly different from previous estimates, suggesting that previous estimates may be appropriate for counselling in this population.	4
Loss of LZAP inactivates p53 and regulates sensitivity of cells to DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. ||  || Chemotherapy and radiation, the two most common cancer therapies, exert their anticancer effects by causing damage to cellular DNA. However, systemic treatment damages DNA not only in cancer, but also in healthy cells, resulting in the progression of serious side effects and limiting efficacy of the treatment. Interestingly, in response to DNA damage, p53 seems to play an opposite role in normal and in the majority of cancer cells-wild-type p53 mediates apoptosis in healthy tissues, attributing to the side effects, whereas mutant p53 often is responsible for acquired cancer resistance to the treatment. Here, we show that leucine zipper-containing ARF-binding protein (LZAP) binds and stabilizes p53. LZAP depletion eliminates p53 protein independently of its mutation status, subsequently protecting wild-type p53 cells from DNA damage-induced cell death, while rendering cells expressing mutant p53 more sensitive to the treatment. In human non-small-cell lung cancer, LZAP levels correlated with p53 levels, suggesting that loss of LZAP may represent a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation in human cancer. Our studies establish LZAP as a p53 regulator and p53-dependent determinative of cell fate in response to DNA damaging treatment.	0
Human-induced pluripotent stem cell models of inherited cardiomyopathies. || Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Drug Discovery Genome-Wide Association Study Humans In Vitro Techniques Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Models, Cardiovascular Myocytes, Cardiac || This article provides an overview of the latest advances in in-vitro modeling of inherited cardiomyopathies using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Inherited cardiomyopathies have been recently modeled by generating iPSCs from patients harboring mutations in genes associated with the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia. Patient-specific iPSCs and their differentiated cardiomyocytes (induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) now provide a novel model to study the underlying molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis of familial cardiomyopathies as well as for in-vitro drug screening and drug discovery.	4
The free energy landscape of small molecule unbinding. || Crystallography, X-Ray Dimethyl Sulfoxide Molecular Dynamics Simulation Pentanones Protein Binding Protein Folding Tacrolimus Binding Proteins Thermodynamics Water || The spontaneous dissociation of six small ligands from the active site of FKBP (the FK506 binding protein) is investigated by explicit water molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis. The ligands have between four (dimethylsulphoxide) and eleven (5-diethylamino-2-pentanone) non-hydrogen atoms, and an affinity for FKBP ranging from 20 to 0.2 mM. The conformations of the FKBP/ligand complex saved along multiple trajectories (50 runs at 310 K for each ligand) are grouped according to a set of intermolecular distances into nodes of a network, and the direct transitions between them are the links. The network analysis reveals that the bound state consists of several subbasins, i.e., binding modes characterized by distinct intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. The dissociation kinetics show a simple (i.e., single-exponential) time dependence because the unbinding barrier is much higher than the barriers between subbasins in the bound state. The unbinding transition state is made up of heterogeneous positions and orientations of the ligand in the FKBP active site, which correspond to multiple pathways of dissociation. For the six small ligands of FKBP, the weaker the binding affinity the closer to the bound state (along the intermolecular distance) are the transition state structures, which is a new manifestation of Hammond behavior. Experimental approaches to the study of fragment binding to proteins have limitations in temporal and spatial resolution. Our network analysis of the unbinding simulations of small inhibitors from an enzyme paints a clear picture of the free energy landscape (both thermodynamics and kinetics) of ligand unbinding.	0
The Importance of the Right Framework: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway and the Scaffolding Protein PTPIP51. || Animals Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mitochondrial Proteins Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Protein Binding Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases Signal Transduction || The protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) regulates and interconnects signaling pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and an abundance of different others, e.g., Akt signaling, NF-κB signaling, and the communication between different cell organelles. PTPIP51 acts as a scaffold protein for signaling proteins, e.g., Raf-1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), as well as for other scaffold proteins, e.g., 14-3-3 proteins. These interactions are governed by the phosphorylation of serine and tyrosine residues of PTPIP51. The phosphorylation status is finely tuned by receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR, Her2), non-receptor tyrosine kinases (c-Src) and the phosphatase protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). This review addresses various diseases which display at least one alteration in these enzymes regulating PTPIP51-interactions. The objective of this review is to summarize the knowledge of the MAPK-related interactome of PTPIP51 for several tumor entities and metabolic disorders.	0
Three common GJB2 mutations causing nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese populations are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. || Blotting, Western China Connexin 26 Connexins Endoplasmic Reticulum Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Microscopy, Confocal Mutant Proteins Mutation Transfection || The three most common GJB2 mutations found in the Chinese populations, c.235delC, c.299-300delAT, and c.176-191de1 (16) bp, cannot form gap junctons (GJs) in the plasma membrane. These mutant proteins were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that ER stress (ERS) and subsequent ERS-induced cell death may be responsible for hearing loss caused by these GJB2 truncation mutations. The objective of this study was to investigate the subcellular location of the protein products of three GJB2 mutants (c.235de1C, c.299-300delAT, and c.176-191de1 (16) bp) and to explore the deafness mechanism caused by these GJB2 truncation mutations. Mutant-eGFP fusion protein vectors were constructed by PCR and TA cloning. HEK293 cells were transfected by a liposome-mediated method. Transfected cells were incubated with ER-Tracker and observed under a confocal microscope. Cells transfected with wild type gave characteristic punctuate patterns of GJs in the cell membrane. In contrast, c.235de1C, c.299-300delAT, and c.176-191de1 (16) bp mutant proteins were found to be trapped in the ER, and were therefore unable to form GJs in the plasma membrane.	0
Antitumor activity of the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 [corrected] against BRAF mutant, NRAS mutant and wild-type melanoma. || Cell Line, Tumor Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Drug Synergism GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Indazoles Indoles Inhibitory Concentration 50 Membrane Proteins Molecular Targeted Therapy Multiple Myeloma Mutation Piperazines Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Sulfonamides Vemurafenib || In melanoma, dysregulation of the MAPK pathway, usually via BRAF(V600) or NRAS(Q61) somatic mutations, leads to constitutive ERK signaling. While BRAF inhibitors are initially effective for BRAF-mutant melanoma, no FDA-approved targeted therapies exist for BRAF-inhibitor-resistant BRAF(V600), NRAS mutant, or wild-type melanoma. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of SCH772984, a novel inhibitor of ERK1/2, was determined in a panel of 50 melanoma cell lines. Effects on MAPK and AKT signaling by western blotting and cell cycle by flow cytometry were determined. Sensitivity fell into three groups: sensitive, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 1 μM; intermediately sensitive, IC50 1-2 μM; and resistant, >2 μM. Fifteen of 21 (71%) BRAF mutants, including 4 with innate vemurafenib resistance, were sensitive to SCH772984. All three (100%) BRAF/NRAS double mutants, 11 of 14 (78%) NRAS mutants and 5 of 7 (71%) wild-type melanomas were sensitive. Among BRAF(V600) mutants with in vitro acquired resistance to vemurafenib, those with MAPK pathway reactivation as the mechanism of resistance were sensitive to SCH772984. SCH772984 caused G1 arrest and induced apoptosis. Combining vemurafenib and SCH722984 in BRAF mutant melanoma was synergistic in a majority of cell lines and significantly delayed the onset of acquired resistance in long term in vitro assays. Therefore, SCH772984 may be clinically applicable as a treatment for non-BRAF mutant melanoma or in BRAF-mutant melanoma with innate or acquired resistance, alone or in combination with BRAF inhibitors.	0
Targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction by the small-molecule MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a: a new challenged target therapy in adult Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. || Adult Aged Antineoplastic Agents Cell Survival Female Humans Imidazoles Male Middle Aged Piperazines Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || MDM2 is an important negative regulator of p53 tumor suppressor. In this study, we sought to investigate the preclinical activity of the MDM2 antagonist, Nutlin-3a, in Philadelphia positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph-) leukemic cell line models, and primary B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient samples. We demonstrated that Nutlin-3a treatment reduced viability and induced p53-mediated apoptosis in ALL cells with wild-type p53 protein, in a time and dose-dependent manner, resulting in the increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and key regulators of cell cycle arrest. The dose-dependent reduction in cell viability was confirmed in primary blast cells from B-ALL patients, including Ph+ ALL resistant patients carrying the T315I BCR-ABL1 mutation. Our findings provide a strong rational for further clinical investigation of Nutlin-3a in Ph+ and Ph- ALL.	0
Identification of Seven Novel Mutations in the Acid Alpha-glucosidase Gene in Five Chinese Patients with Late-onset Pompe Disease. || Adolescent Adult Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Mutation Young Adult alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal glycogen storage disorder linked to the acid alpha-glucosidase gene (GAA). A wide clinical and genetic variability exists between patients from different ethnic populations, and the genotype-phenotype correlations are still not well understood. The aim of this study was to report the clinicopathological and genetic characteristics of five Chinese patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) who carried novel GAA gene mutations. Clinical and pathological data of patients diagnosed with glycogen storage disease at our institution from April 1986 to August 2017 were collected, and next-generation sequencing of frozen muscle specimens was conducted. Of the five patients included in the study, the median disease onset age was 13 years, with a median 5 years delay in diagnosis. The patients mainly manifested as progressive weakness in the proximal and axial muscles, while one patient developed respiratory insufficiency that required artificial ventilation. In muscle biopsies, vacuoles with variable sizes and shapes appeared inside muscle fibers, and they stained positive for both periodic acid-Schiff and acid phosphatase staining. Ten GAA gene mutations, including seven novel ones (c.796C>A, c.1057C>T, c.1201C>A, c.1780C>T, c.1799G>C, c.2051C>A, c.2235dupG), were identified by genetic tests. The seven novel GAA gene mutations revealed in this study broaden the genetic spectrum of LOPD and highlight the genetic heterogeneity in Chinese LOPD patients.	1
POLE and POLD1 mutations in 529 kindred with familial colorectal cancer and/or polyposis: review of reported cases and recommendations for genetic testing and surveillance. || Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Alleles Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Polymerase II DNA Polymerase III Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Testing Genotype Germ-Line Mutation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs || Germ-line mutations in the exonuclease domains of POLE and POLD1 have been recently associated with polyposis and colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition. Here, we aimed to gain a better understanding of the phenotypic characteristics of this syndrome to establish specific criteria for POLE and POLD1 mutation screening and to help define the clinical management of mutation carriers. The exonuclease domains of POLE and POLD1 were studied in 529 kindred, 441 with familial nonpolyposis CRC and 88 with polyposis, by using pooled DNA amplification and massively parallel sequencing. Seven novel or rare genetic variants were identified. In addition to the POLE p.L424V recurrent mutation in a patient with polyposis, CRC and oligodendroglioma, six novel or rare POLD1 variants (four of them, p.D316H, p.D316G, p.R409W, and p.L474P, with strong evidence for pathogenicity) were identified in nonpolyposis CRC families. Phenotypic data from these and previously reported POLE/POLD1 carriers point to an associated phenotype characterized by attenuated or oligo-adenomatous colorectal polyposis, CRC, and probably brain tumors. In addition, POLD1 mutations predispose to endometrial and breast tumors. Our results widen the phenotypic spectrum of the POLE/POLD1-associated syndrome and identify novel pathogenic variants. We propose guidelines for genetic testing and surveillance recommendations.Genet Med 18 4, 325-332.	4
Genome-Wide Association Study in Craniosynostosis Condition Using Innovative Systematic Bioinformatic Analysis Tools and Techniques: Future Prospective and Clinical Practice. || Craniosynostosis (CS) genome-wide association study nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSCS) sagittal synostosis suture whole exome sequencing (WES) || Craniosynostosis (CS) conditions are included with the premature fusion of one or more multiple cranial sutures. As the second leading and most common craniofacial anomaly and orofacial clefts globally. Syndromic and nonsyndromic CS (NSCS) occur as a part of a genetic syndrome unlike Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Muenke, and Saethre-Chotzen syndromes. Approximately, 90% of the cases of CS arises from NSCS group and it is now a great challenge for the researcher and neurosurgeon for Indian-origin children, a great burden worldwide. <i>Study design</i>: Prospective study of analysis sequence pattern on CS and NSCS from January 2007 to 2018 was carried out.<i>Inclusion criteria:</i> Diagnosed cases in syndromic and NSCS patients between 3 months and 14 years of age either preoperative or postoperative were included in the study of both groups (syndromic and NSCS).<i>Exclusion criteria:</i> Patients with primary microcephaly (secondary CS), postural plagiocephaly, incomplete data, no visual perception, and who were lost to follow-up, and who had no interest to participate the study were excluded from the study.<i>Bioinformatic analysis:</i> We have performed systematic bioinformatic analysis for all responsible genes by combining with using through the GeneDecks, Gene Runner, DAVID, and STRING databases.<i>Genes testing:</i> FGF family genes, MSX genes, such as Irf6, TP63, Dlx2, Dlx5, Pax3, Pax9, Bmp4, Tgf-beta2, and Tgf-beta3 were found to be involved in Cleft lip and cleft palate (CL/P), and Fgfr2, Fgfr1, Fgfr3, and TWIST, MSX, MSX1, 2 were found to be involved in both the groups of CS (SCS + NSCS). FGFR, MSX, Irf6, TP63, Dlx2, Dlx5, Pax3, Pax9, Bmp4, Tgf-beta2, and Tgf-beta3 demonstrated and find out that in CL/P, and Fgfr2, Fgfr1, Fgfr3, and Twist1 had accurate sequence data with more than accuracy of 95% reported with proper order with additional anomalies CS through newly developed tools. Newly developed techniques of GeneDecks, Gene Runner, DAVID, and STRING databases gave better picture to analyze the larger population, patients (SCS + NSCS) with complex genetic, maternal, parental age, environmental, and stochastic factors contributing to NSCS networking, signaling, and pathways involvement. This bioinformatic tools analyzed better prediction of CS and NSCS sequences guiding us the newer invention modalities of pattern of screening and further development of recent future application.	4
Intrinsic Differences in Backbone Dynamics between Wild Type and DNA-Contact Mutants of the p53 DNA Binding Domain Revealed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. || Amino Acid Substitution Dimerization Hydrodynamics Models, Molecular Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular Peptide Fragments Point Mutation Protein Conformation Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Stability Recombinant Proteins Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutations in p53's DNA binding domain (p53DBD) are associated with 50% of all cancers, making it an essential system to investigate and understand the genesis and progression of cancer. In this work, we studied the changes in the structure and dynamics of wild type p53DBD in comparison with two of its "hot-spot" DNA-contact mutants, R248Q and R273H, by analysis of backbone amide chemical shift perturbations and 15N spin relaxation measurements. The results of amide chemical shift changes indicated significantly more perturbations in the R273H mutant than in wild type and R248Q p53DBD. Analysis of15N spin relaxation rates and the resulting nuclear magnetic resonance order parameters suggests that for most parts, the R248Q mutant exhibits limited conformational flexibility and is similar to the wild type protein. In contrast, R273H showed significant backbone dynamics extending up to its β-sandwich scaffold in addition to motions along the DNA binding interface. Furthermore, comparison of rotational correlation times between the mutants suggests that the R273H mutant, with a higher correlation time, forms an enlarged structural fold in comparison to the R248Q mutant and wild type p53DBD. Finally, we identify three regions in these proteins that show conformational flexibility to varying degrees, which suggests that the R273H mutant, in addition to being a DNA-contact mutation, exhibits properties of a conformational mutant.	0
Phenylalanine tolerance in three phenylketonuric women pregnant with fetuses of different genetic PKU status. ||  || Pregnancy management in phenylketonuric women includes continuous dietary control starting before conception, aiming to maintain blood phenylalanine concentrations in a desirable range, irrespective of the fetal genetic PKU status. While the maternal phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotype will influence metabolic control, an effect of the fetal genetic PKU status on maternal metabolic control during pregnancy has not been described. We monitored three pregnancies of women with classical PKU by dietary protocols of daily phenylalanine intake, phenylalanine blood concentrations, and obstetric care. Patients 1 and 2 carried a heterozygous (not PKU-affected) fetus, while patient 3 was pregnant with a PKU-affected fetus (PAH p.R408W and p.R408W). The expected increase in phenylalanine tolerance during the course of pregnancy was observed in patients 1 and 2 in whom phenylalanine intake could be steadily increased from 400 to 1700 mg/day while phenylalanine blood concentrations remained in the desired range. Gain of body weight was 13.0 and 17.7 kg, respectively. In patient 3, the phenylalanine tolerance did not rise above 600 mg/day, and phenylalanine blood concentrations were above the desired range on several occasions. Caloric intake was therefore encouraged, which led to a weight gain of 20.0 kg. The course of pregnancy was otherwise normal in all three cases, and infants with normal birth weight and head circumference were born. The different phenylalanine tolerance in pregnancies with PKU-affected and non-affected fetuses suggests that PAH genotype and metabolic situation of the fetus influence maternal metabolic control. A phenylalanine tolerance remaining low in the third trimester of pregnancy may indicate fetal PKU.	1 3
An international effort towards developing standards for best practices in analysis, interpretation and reporting of clinical genome sequencing results in the CLARITY Challenge. || Child Databases, Genetic Female Financing, Organized Genetic Testing Genomics Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Male Myopathies, Structural, Congenital Peer Review, Research Sequence Analysis, DNA || There is tremendous potential for genome sequencing to improve clinical diagnosis and care once it becomes routinely accessible, but this will require formalizing research methods into clinical best practices in the areas of sequence data generation, analysis, interpretation and reporting. The CLARITY Challenge was designed to spur convergence in methods for diagnosing genetic disease starting from clinical case history and genome sequencing data. DNA samples were obtained from three families with heritable genetic disorders and genomic sequence data were donated by sequencing platform vendors. The challenge was to analyze and interpret these data with the goals of identifying disease-causing variants and reporting the findings in a clinically useful format. Participating contestant groups were solicited broadly, and an independent panel of judges evaluated their performance. A total of 30 international groups were engaged. The entries reveal a general convergence of practices on most elements of the analysis and interpretation process. However, even given this commonality of approach, only two groups identified the consensus candidate variants in all disease cases, demonstrating a need for consistent fine-tuning of the generally accepted methods. There was greater diversity of the final clinical report content and in the patient consenting process, demonstrating that these areas require additional exploration and standardization. The CLARITY Challenge provides a comprehensive assessment of current practices for using genome sequencing to diagnose and report genetic diseases. There is remarkable convergence in bioinformatic techniques, but medical interpretation and reporting are areas that require further development by many groups.	4
[Mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene detected in 20 patients with phenylketonuria from Yunnan Province]. ||  || To investigate the mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in 20 phenylketonuria (PKU) patients from Yunnan. The 13 exons and the splicing regions of 12 introns of the PAH gene were sequenced to detect mutations in 20 unrelated PKU patients. PAH gene sequencing has revealed 15 types of mutations, in which the most frequently mutation was p.R243Q (30.0%), followed by p.Y356X(10.0%), p.R111X (7.5%), IVS4+2T>A (7.5%) and p.V399V (7.5%). Exons 7, 11, 3 and introns 4, 11 were most frequently involved. Six novel mutations, including c.59A>C, c.60G>C, c.690_691insG, c.1119_1120insT, c.441+2T>A, c.842+4A>T and c.1200+1T>G were detected. PAH gene mutations identified in Yunnan are more similar to those of northern China, with R243R being the most common, though there are still certain characteristics for the type and frequency of mutations.	3
Population genetics of phenylketonuria. || Asia Europe Founder Effect Gene Frequency Haplotypes Humans Molecular Epidemiology Mutation Phenylketonurias || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a large number of mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus, most of which are strongly associated with specific RFLP or VNTR haplotypes. One of the major questions remaining in PKU research is why this apparently maladaptive disorder has been maintained at a frequency of approximately 1 in 10,000 among Caucasians. A growing number of studies have provided evidence that both the relatively high frequency of PKU and the strong mutation/haplotype associations might reflect the existence of multiple founding populations for PKU. Examples of putative founding populations for PKU in both Europe and Asia will be presented. Some PAH mutations are associated with multiple haplotypes, suggesting recurrence. Evidence for and against recurrence as the mechanism responsible for the association of the R408W mutation with RFLP haplotypes 1 and 2 will be discussed.	1 3
[Genetic analysis of 36 children affected with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency from Fujian]. ||  || To study the characteristics of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) mutations in patients with PAH deficiency in Fujian population. Peripheral blood samples of 36 patients and their parents with classical type phenylketouria (PKU) were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted. Following PCR amplification, DNA sequencing was carried out to identify the origins of mutations. Twenty types mutations were identified in 63 of the 72 alleles. The most common mutations were R241C, R408Q and Ex6-96A>G, which respectively accounted for 15.9%, 12.7% and 11.1% of all mutant alleles. The c.189_190dupTGAC mutation was first reported. R241C was associated with 28% of mild hyperphenylalaninemia and R408Q is associated with 25% of classical PKU. There is a specific spectrum of PAH gene mutation in Fujian region. R241C, R408Q and Ex6-96A>G are the most common mutations.	1 3
Spectrum and origin of phenylketonuria mutations in Spain. || DNA Mutational Analysis Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Haplotypes Humans Minisatellite Repeats Mutation Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Prevalence Spain || In order to characterize the molecular heterogeneity of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiencies in the Spanish population, 37 PKU patients were initially screened for 16 known European mutations. For the remaining unidentified alleles, we used a combined strategy based on single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Overall, a total of 15 different mutations were found in our sample, which account for 62% of the total mutant alleles. We also investigated the association between the mutations, haplotypes and variable number of tandem repeats described on the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. In addition, we analyzed the geographical distribution in Spain of the two most prevalent mutations in our population: IVS10 and I65T.	1 3
Automated sequencing detects all mutations in Northern Irish patients with phenylketonuria and mild hyperphenylalaninaemia. || DNA Mutational Analysis Gene Frequency Humans Mutation Northern Ireland Phenylketonurias Severity of Illness Index || In the first phase of the Northern Ireland PKU Study, we used automated sequencing to identify the spectrum of mutations in a random group of 32 unrelated phenylketonuria (PKU) families. We also investigated 7 Northern Irish patients with mild hyperphenylalaninaemia not requiring dietary intervention (MHP, previously referred to as non-PKU HPA). Disease-causing mutations were identified on all 78 investigated chromosomes. We found 23 different mutations, including 20 missense, 1 nonsense and 2 splice site mutations. All mutations were located within exons or at intron-exon boundaries of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Seven mutations occurred at CpG sites, confirming these sites as mutation hot-spots in PKU. Mutations R408W and I65T are the two commonest PKU mutations in the Northern Irish population. Two mutations (T380M and V245A) can be characterized as MHP mutations; they are quasi dominant markers for MHP since they cause mild hyperphenylalaninaemia even when occurring in conjunction with the most severe PKU mutations. The results have proven valuable for the development of a routine PKU mutation analysis system in Northern Ireland.	1 3
Nimbolide reduces CD44 positive cell population and induces mitochondrial apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. || Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic Apoptosis Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Caspase Inhibitors Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Deoxycytidine Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Humans Hyaluronan Receptors Limonins Mitochondria Mutation Neoplastic Stem Cells Pancreatic Neoplasms Reactive Oxygen Species Time Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly aggressive disease and current treatment regimens fail to effectively cure PDAC. Development of resistance to current therapy is one of the key reasons for this outcome. Nimbolide (NL), a triterpenoid obtained from Azadirachta indica, exhibits anticancer properties in various cancer including PDAC cells. However, the underlying mechanism of this anticancer agent in PDAC cells remains undefined. We show that NL exerts a higher level of apoptotic cell death compared to the first-line agent gemcitabine for PDAC, as well as other anticancer agents including sorafenib and curcumin. The anticancer efficacy of NL was further evidenced by a reduction in the CD44+ as well as cancer stem-like cell (CSC) population, as it causes decreased sphere formation. Mechanistically, the anticancer efficacy of NL associates with reduced mutant p53 as well as increased mitochondrial activity in the form of increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial mass. Together, this study highlights the therapeutic potential of NL in mutant p53 expressing pancreatic cancer.	0
Targeting of Mutant p53 and the Cellular Redox Balance by APR-246 as a Strategy for Efficient Cancer Therapy. ||  || TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. The p53 protein activates transcription of genes that promote cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, or regulate cell metabolism, and other processes. Missense mutations in TP53 abolish specific DNA binding of p53 and allow evasion of apoptosis and accelerated tumor progression. Mutant p53 often accumulates at high levels in tumor cells. Pharmacological reactivation of mutant p53 has emerged as a promising strategy for improved cancer therapy. Small molecules that restore wild type activity of mutant p53 have been identified using various approaches. One of these molecules, APR-246, is a prodrug that is converted to the Michael acceptor methylene quinuclidinone (MQ) that binds covalently to cysteines in p53, leading to refolding and restoration of wild type p53 function. MQ also targets the cellular redox balance by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) and depleting glutathione. This dual mechanism of action may account for the striking synergy between APR-246 and platinum compounds. APR-246 is the only mutant p53-targeting compound in clinical development. A phase I/IIa clinical trial in hematological malignancies and prostate cancer showed good safety profile and clinical effects in some patients. APR-246 is currently tested in a phase Ib/II trial in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer.	0
Molecular analysis of PKU in Ireland. || Gene Frequency Haplotypes Humans Ireland Minisatellite Repeats Mutation Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Prevalence || Classical phenylketonuria (PKU: McKusick No. 261600) is caused by mutations occurring at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus on chromosome 12 and has a prevalence in Ireland of 1 in 4500. We examined 304 independent alleles from 350 patients for the presence of six mutations and have characterized VNTR alleles within the minisatellite region 3' to the PAH gene in patients carrying the most prevalent mutation. R408W was the most common mutation found, with a relative frequency of 42%. All other mutations had relative frequencies of < 10%. VNTR analysis showed that the R408W mutation is associated with the VNTR-8 allele in the Irish population, indicating that R408W is associated with RFLP haplotype 1. This differs from that reported from eastern Europe where R408W is associated with RFLP haplotype 2/VNTR-3; an observation which has led several groups to propose a Balto-Slavic origin for this mutation. These results support the hypothesis of a second, independent founding event for the R408W mutation on an RFLP haplotype 1 VNTR-8 chromosome background in the Irish/Celtic population.	1 3
Establishment of a Flexible Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Platform for Detecting Prevalent Deafness Mutations Associated with Variable Degree of Sensorineural Hearing Loss in Koreans. || Adult DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Republic of Korea || Many cutting-edge technologies based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been employed to identify candidate variants responsible for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, these methods have limitations preventing their wide clinical use for primary screening, in that they remain costly and it is not always suitable to analyze massive amounts of data. Several different DNA chips have been developed for screening prevalent mutations at a lower cost. However, most of these platforms do not offer the flexibility to add or remove target mutations, thereby limiting their wider use in a field that requires frequent updates. Therefore, we aimed to establish a simpler and more flexible molecular diagnostic platform based on ethnicity-specific mutation spectrums of SNHL, which would enable bypassing unnecessary filtering steps in a substantial portion of cases. In addition, we expanded the screening platform to cover varying degrees of SNHL. With this aim, we selected 11 variants of 5 genes (GJB2, SLC26A4, MTRNR1, TMPRSS3, and CDH23) showing high prevalence with varying degrees in Koreans and developed the U-TOP™ HL Genotyping Kit, a real-time PCR-based method using the MeltingArray technique and peptide nucleic acid probes. The results of 271 DNA samples with wild type sequences or mutations in homo- or heterozygote form were compared between the U-TOP™ HL Genotyping Kit and Sanger sequencing. The positive and negative predictive values were 100%, and this method showed perfect agreement with Sanger sequencing, with a Kappa value of 1.00. The U-TOP™ HL Genotyping Kit showed excellent performance in detecting varying degrees and phenotypes of SNHL mutations in both homozygote and heterozygote forms, which are highly prevalent in the Korean population. This platform will serve as a useful and cost-effective first-line screening tool for varying degrees of genetic SNHL and facilitate genome-based personalized hearing rehabilitation for the Korean population.	4
Mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene using heteroduplex analysis with synthetic DNA constructs. || DNA DNA Mutational Analysis England Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Humans Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Scotland Wales || Using heteroduplex analysis generated with synthetic PCR-amplifiable DNA we have screened the PKU populations of southwest England and Wales, western Scotland, and southeast and central England for mutations in exons 3, 7 and 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. The technique characterized three mutations in exon 12, two in exon 3 and five in exon 7. Altogether over 370 PKU chromosomes were screened. In all geographical regions exon 12 mutations (R408W, IVS12nt1g- > a and Y414C) accounted for about 40% of mutant chromosomes. Exon 3 mutations (principally I65T) were found on between 9 and 12% of mutant alleles and exon 7 mutations accounted for a further 5-7%. Heteroduplex analysis is rapid, simple and safe and three constructs covering three exons can identify between 55 and 60% of mutations in various PKU populations of the UK.	3
Complexes formed by mutant p53 and their roles in breast cancer. ||  || Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women, and mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 are commonly detected in the most aggressive subtypes. The majority of TP53 gene alterations are missense substitutions, leading to expression of mutant forms of the p53 protein that are frequently detected at high levels in cancer cells. P53 mutants not only lose the physiological tumor-suppressive activity of the wild-type p53 protein but also acquire novel powerful oncogenic functions, referred to as gain of function, that may actively confer a selective advantage during tumor progression. Some of the best-characterized oncogenic activities of mutant p53 are mediated by its ability to form aberrant protein complexes with other transcription factors or proteins not directly related to gene transcription. The set of cellular proteins available to interact with mutant p53 is dependent on cell type and extensively affected by environmental signals, so the prognostic impact of p53 mutation is complex. Specific functional interactions of mutant p53 can profoundly impact homeostasis of breast cancer cells, reprogramming gene expression in response to specific extracellular inputs or cell-intrinsic conditions. The list of protein complexes involving mutant p53 in breast cancer is continuously growing, as is the number of oncogenic phenotypes in which they could be involved. In consideration of the functional impact of such complexes, key interactions of mutant p53 may be exploited as potential targets for development of therapies aimed at defusing the oncogenic potential of p53 mutation.	0
A novel mutation and in vivo confocal microscopic findings in Fabry disease. ||  || Fabry disease is a hereditary, X-linked lysosomal storage disease due to a deficiency of the alpha galactosidase A enzyme. Globotriaosylceramide accumulates in tissues and results in multiorgan dysfunction. The most common ocular finding in Fabry disease is cornea verticillata. Increase in conjunctival vascular tortuosity, and cataract may also be seen. Herein, we demonstrate the in vivo confocal microscopic findings of a genetically proven Fabry disease patient with a novel hemizygous R112L mutation in GLA gene.	3
Structural mechanism associated with domain opening in gain-of-function mutations in SHP2 phosphatase. || Humans Leukemia Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Noonan Syndrome Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 src Homology Domains || The SHP2 phosphatase plays a central role in a number of signaling pathways were it dephosphorylates various substrate proteins. Regulation of SHP2 activity is, in part, achieved by an intramolecular interaction between the PTP domain of the protein, which contains the catalytic site, and the N-SH2 domain leading to a "closed" protein conformation and autoinhibition. Accordingly, "opening" of the N-SH2 and PTP domains is required for the protein to become active. Binding of phosphopeptides to the N-SH2 domain is known to induce the opening event, while a number of gain-of-function (GOF) mutants, implicated in Noonan's Syndrome and childhood leukemias, are thought to facilitate opening. In the present study, a combination of computational and experimental methods are used to investigate the structural mechanism of opening of SHP2 and the impact of three GOF mutants, D61G, E76K, and N308D, on the opening mechanism. Calculated free energies of opening indicate that opening must be facilitated by effector molecules, possibly the protein substrates themselves, as the calculated free energies preclude spontaneous opening. Simulations of both wild type (WT) SHP2 and GOF mutants in the closed state indicate GOF activity to involve increased solvent exposure of selected residues, most notably Arg362, which in turn may enhance interactions of SHP2 with its substrate proteins and thereby aid opening. In addition, GOF mutations cause structural changes in the phosphopeptide-binding region of the N-SH2 domain leading to conformations that mimic the bound state. Such conformational changes are suggested to enhance binding of phosphopeptides and/or decrease interactions between the PTP and N-SH2 domains thereby facilitating opening. Experimental assays of the impact of effector molecules on SHP2 phosphatase activity against both small molecule and peptide substrates support the hypothesized mechanism of GOF mutant action. The present calculations also suggest a role for the C-SH2 domain of SHP2 in stabilizing the overall conformation of the protein in the open state, thereby aiding conformational switching between the open active and closed inactive states.	0
Molecular heterogeneity assessment by next-generation sequencing and response to gefitinib of EGFR mutant advanced lung adenocarcinoma. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Gefitinib Genes, erbB-1 High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Mutation Proportional Hazards Models Quinazolines Sequence Analysis, DNA || Cancer molecular heterogeneity might explain the variable response of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinomas to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We assessed the mutational status of 22 cancer genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in poor, intermediate or good responders to first-line gefitinib. Clinical outcome was correlated with Additional Coexisting Mutations (ACMs) and the EGFR Proportion of Mutated Alleles (PMA). Thirteen ACMs were found in 10/17 patients: TP53 (n=6), KRAS (n=2), CTNNB1 (n=2), PIK3CA, SMAD4 and MET (n=1 each). TP53 mutations were exclusive of poor/intermediate responders (66.7% versus 0, p=0.009). Presence of ACMs significantly affected both PFS (median 3.0 versus 12.3 months, p=0.03) and survival (3.6 months versus not reached, p=0.03). TP53 mutation was the strongest negative modifier (median PFS 4.0 versus 14.0 months). Higher EGFR PMA was present in good versus poor/intermediate responders. Median PFS and survival were longer in patients with EGFR PMA ≥0.36 (12.0 versus 4.0 months, p=0.31; not reached versus 18.0 months, p=0.59). Patients with an EGFR PMA ≥0.36 and no ACMs fared significantly better (p=0.03), with a trend towards increased survival (p=0.06). Our exploratory data suggest that a quantitative (PMA) and qualitative (ACMs) molecular heterogeneity assessment using NGS might be useful for a better selection of patients.	4
An atypical case of Noonan syndrome with KRAS mutation diagnosed by targeted exome sequencing. ||  || Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder caused by autosomal dominant inheritance and is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, short stature, chest deformity, and congenital heart disease. In individuals with NS, germline mutations have been identified in several genes involved in the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. Because of its clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the conventional diagnostic protocol with Sanger sequencing requires a multistep approach. Therefore, molecular genetic diagnosis using targeted exome sequencing (TES) is considered a less expensive and faster method, particularly for patients who do not fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria of NS. In this case, the patient showed short stature, dysmorphic facial features suggestive of NS, feeding intolerance, cryptorchidism, and intellectual disability in early childhood. At the age of 16, the patient still showed extreme short stature with delayed puberty and characteristic facial features suggestive of NS. Although the patient had no cardiac problems or chest wall deformities, which are commonly present in NS and are major concerns for patients and clinicians, the patient showed several other characteristic clinical features of NS. Considering the possibility of a genetic disorder, including NS, a molecular genetic study with TES was performed. With TES analysis, we detected a pathogenic variant of c.458A > T in KRAS in this patient with atypical NS phenotype and provided appropriate clinical management and genetic counseling. The application of TES enables accurate molecular diagnosis of patients with nonspecific or atypical features in genetic diseases with several responsible genes, such as NS.	4
Prevalence of CADASIL and Fabry Disease in a Cohort of MRI Defined Younger Onset Lacunar Stroke. || Age of Onset CADASIL Cohort Studies Fabry Disease Female Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Mutation Prevalence Receptor, Notch3 Receptors, Notch Stroke, Lacunar United Kingdom alpha-Galactosidase || Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, is the most common monogenic disorder causing lacunar stroke and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Fabry disease (FD) due to mutations in the GLA gene has been suggested as an underdiagnosed cause of stroke, and one feature is SVD. Previous studies reported varying prevalence of CADASIL and FD in stroke, likely due to varying subtypes studied; no studies have looked at a large cohort of younger onset SVD. We determined the prevalence in a well-defined, MRI-verified cohort of apparently sporadic patients with lacunar infarct. Caucasian patients with lacunar infarction, aged ≤70 years (mean age 56.7 (SD8.6)), were recruited from 72 specialist stroke centres throughout the UK as part of the Young Lacunar Stroke DNA Resource. Patients with a previously confirmed monogenic cause of stroke were excluded. All MRI's and clinical histories were reviewed centrally. Screening was performed for NOTCH3 and GLA mutations. Of 994 subjects five had pathogenic NOTCH3 mutations (R169C, R207C, R587C, C1222G and C323S) all resulting in loss or gain of a cysteine in the NOTCH3 protein. All five patients had confluent leukoaraiosis (Fazekas grade ≥2). CADASIL prevalence overall was 0.5% (95% CI 0.2%-1.1%) and among cases with confluent leukoaraiosis 1.5% (95% CI 0.6%-3.3%). No classic pathogenic FD mutations were found; one patient had a missense mutation (R118C), associated with late-onset FD. CADASIL cases are rare and only detected in SVD patients with confluent leukoaraiosis. No definite FD cases were detected.	4
Ligand binding and hydration in protein misfolding: insights from studies of prion and p53 tumor suppressor proteins. || Humans Ligands Nucleic Acids Prions Protein Folding Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Water || Protein misfolding has been implicated in a large number of diseases termed protein- folding disorders (PFDs), which include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, familial amyloid polyneuropathy, Huntington's disease, and type II diabetes. In these diseases, large quantities of incorrectly folded proteins undergo aggregation, destroying brain cells and other tissues. The interplay between ligand binding and hydration is an important component of the formation of misfolded protein species. Hydration drives various biological processes, including protein folding, ligand binding, macromolecular assembly, enzyme kinetics, and signal transduction. The changes in hydration and packing, both when proteins fold correctly or when folding goes wrong, leading to PFDs, are examined through several biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches. Although in many cases the binding of a ligand such as a nucleic acid helps to prevent misfolding and aggregation, there are several examples in which ligands induce misfolding and assembly into amyloids. This occurs simply because the formation of structured aggregates (such as protofibrillar and fibrillar amyloids) involves decreases in hydration, formation of a hydrogen-bond network in the secondary structure, and burying of nonpolar amino acid residues, processes that also occur in the normal folding landscape. In this Account, we describe the present knowledge of the folding and misfolding of different proteins, with a detailed emphasis on mammalian prion protein (PrP) and tumoral suppressor protein p53; we also explore how ligand binding and hydration together influence the fate of the proteins. Anfinsen's paradigm that the structure of a protein is determined by its amino acid sequence is to some extent contradicted by the observation that there are two isoforms of the prion protein with the same sequence: the cellular and the misfolded isoform. The cellular isoform of PrP has a disordered N-terminal domain and a highly flexible, not-well-packed C-terminal domain, which might account for its significant hydration. When PrP binds to biological molecules, such as glycosaminoglycans and nucleic acids, the disordered segments appear to fold and become less hydrated. Formation of the PrP-nucleic acid complex seems to accelerate the conversion of the cellular form of the protein into the disease-causing isoform. For p53, binding to some ligands, including nucleic acids, would prevent misfolding of the protein. Recently, several groups have begun to analyze the folding-misfolding of the individual domains of p53, but several questions remain unanswered. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the productive and incorrect folding pathways of these proteins in normal physiological states and in human disease, such as prion disorders and cancer. These studies are shown to lay the groundwork for the development of new drugs.	0
Identification of an Allosteric Binding Site on Human Lysosomal Alpha-Galactosidase Opens the Way to New Pharmacological Chaperones for Fabry Disease. || Allosteric Site Animals COS Cells Catalytic Domain Cercopithecus aethiops Fabry Disease Humans Lysosomes Molecular Docking Simulation Mutation Purines alpha-Galactosidase || Personalized therapies are required for Fabry disease due to its large phenotypic spectrum and numerous different genotypes. In principle, missense mutations that do not affect the active site could be rescued with pharmacological chaperones. At present pharmacological chaperones for Fabry disease bind the active site and couple a stabilizing effect, which is required, to an inhibitory effect, which is deleterious. By in silico docking we identified an allosteric hot-spot for ligand binding where a drug-like compound, 2,6-dithiopurine, binds preferentially. 2,6-dithiopurine stabilizes lysosomal alpha-galactosidase in vitro and rescues a mutant that is not responsive to a mono-therapy with previously described pharmacological chaperones, 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin and galactose in a cell based assay.	0

ERBB activation modulates sensitivity to MEK1/2 inhibition in a subset of driver-negative melanoma. || Cell Line, Tumor Dual-Specificity Phosphatases ErbB Receptors Humans MAP Kinase Kinase 1 MAP Kinase Kinase 2 Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction Skin Neoplasms || Melanomas are characterized by activating "driver" mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11. Resultant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling makes some melanomas susceptible to BRAF (BRAF V600 mutations), MEK1/2 (BRAF V600, L597, fusions; NRAS mutations), or other kinase inhibitors (KIT), respectively. Among driver-negative ("pan-negative") patients, an unexplained heterogeneity of response to MEK1/2 inhibitors has been observed. Analysis of 16 pan-negative melanoma cell lines revealed that 8 (50%; termed Class I) are sensitive to the MEK1/2 inhibitor, trametinib, similar to BRAF V600E melanomas. A second set (termed Class II) display reduced trametinib sensitivity, paradoxical activation of MEK1/2 and basal activation of ERBBs 1, 2, and 3 (4 lines, 25%). In 3 of these lines, PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway signaling is abrogated using the ERBB inhibitor, afatinib, and proliferation is even further reduced upon the addition of trametinib. A potential mechanism of ERBB activation in Class II melanomas is minimal expression of the ERK1/2 phosphatase, DUSP4, as ectopic restoration of DUSP4 attenuated ERBB signaling through potential modulation of the ERBB ligand, amphiregulin (AREG). Consistent with these data, immunohistochemical analysis of patient melanomas revealed a trend towards lower overall DUSP4 expression in pan-negative versus BRAF- and NRAS-mutant tumors. This study is the first to demonstrate that differential ERBB activity in pan-negative melanoma may modulate sensitivity to clinically-available MEK1/2 inhibitors and provides rationale for the use of ERBB inhibitors, potentially in combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors, in subsets of this disease.	0
Inactivation of RASA1 promotes melanoma tumorigenesis via R-Ras activation. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Apoptosis Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Follow-Up Studies Humans Melanoma Mice Mice, Nude Mutation Prognosis Retrospective Studies Signal Transduction Survival Rate Tumor Cells, Cultured Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays p120 GTPase Activating Protein ras Proteins || Inactivation of Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs) can activate Ras, increasing the risk for tumor development. Utilizing a melanoma whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 13 patients, we identified two novel, clustered somatic missense mutations (Y472H and L481F) in RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1, also called p120RasGAP). We have shown that wild type RASA1, but not identified mutants, suppresses soft agar colony formation and tumor growth of BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines via its RasGAP activity toward R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform. Moreover, R-Ras increased and RASA1 suppressed Ral-A activation among Ras downstream effectors. In addition to mutations, loss of RASA1 expression was frequently observed in metastatic melanoma samples on melanoma tissue microarray (TMA) and a low level of RASA1 mRNA expression was associated with decreased overall survival in melanoma patients with BRAF mutations. Thus, these data support that RASA1 is inactivated by mutation or by suppressed expression in melanoma and that RASA1 plays a tumor suppressive role by inhibiting R-Ras, a previously less appreciated member of the Ras small GTPases.	0
Whole-exome sequencing to decipher the genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss in a Chinese family with deaf by deaf mating. || Age of Onset Alleles Amino Acid Sequence Asian Continental Ancestry Group China Conserved Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Exome Female Genetic Heterogeneity Hearing Loss High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Membrane Proteins Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Myosin Type II Pedigree RNA, Ribosomal Sequence Alignment Tomography, X-Ray Computed || Inherited deafness has been shown to have high genetic heterogeneity. For many decades, linkage analysis and candidate gene approaches have been the main tools to elucidate the genetics of hearing loss. However, this associated study design is costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for small families. This is mainly due to the inadequate numbers of available affected individuals, locus heterogeneity, and assortative mating. Exome sequencing has now become technically feasible and a cost-effective method for detection of disease variants underlying Mendelian disorders due to the recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In the present study, we have combined both the Deafness Gene Mutation Detection Array and exome sequencing to identify deafness causative variants in a large Chinese composite family with deaf by deaf mating. The simultaneous screening of the 9 common deafness mutations using the allele-specific PCR based universal array, resulted in the identification of the 1555A>G in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 12S rRNA in affected individuals in one branch of the family. We then subjected the mutation-negative cases to exome sequencing and identified novel causative variants in the MYH14 and WFS1 genes. This report confirms the effective use of a NGS technique to detect pathogenic mutations in affected individuals who were not candidates for classical genetic studies.	4
Side-alternating vibration training improves muscle performance in a patient with late-onset pompe disease. ||  || Side-alternating vibration training (SAVT) was used for 15 weeks in a patient with Late-onset Pompe disease who had never used enzyme replacement or chaperone therapy. Prior to the use of SAVT, the patient had experienced declining muscle performance and her 6-minute walk distance decreased from 210 to 155 metres in 6 months. After SAVT, her 6-minute walk distance increased 70% from 166 to 282 metres, muscle jumping power increased by 64% from 83 to 166 watts, isometric knee extensor strength increased 17% from 38 to 44 Nm, and she achieved a more normal pattern of ankle, knee, and joint kinematics and kinetics. Her functional ability measured through the Rotterdam 9-item score was unchanged at 19/36. There were no elevations in serum creatine kinase or lactate. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a performance improvement in a patient with Pompe disease using SAVT.	1

Detection of the GJB2 Mutation in Iranian Children with Hearing Loss Treated with Cochlear Implantation. ||  || The 35delG mutation in the gap junction protein, β2, 26kDa (GJB2) gene is the most common mutation that has been found in children with non syndromic hearing loss. Testing for the GJB2 gene mutation is simple and can directly answer the concerns of the parents about cause of the disorder and prognosis for their children. Cochlear implantation (CI) is one of the methods of hearing rehabilitation in patients with complete hearing loss. The present study was designed for genetic assessment of children who were referred for CI. Connexin 26 (Cx26) gene analyses were performed on 42 children with non syndromic hearing loss who were referred to the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran for genetic consultation and CI. Clinical history was obtained and an examination conducted on each individual. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and mutation identification of the Cx26 gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and direct sequencing of the coding sequence of the gene. Cochlear implantation was performed for all patients and treatment response was assessed for all of them based on speech intelligibility rating (SIR) before and after CI. We found six patients (14.3%) with the 35delG mutation on the Cx26 gene, two homozygotes and four heterozygotes. No other mutation was detected. Treatment response in children with the homozygous 35delG mutation was better than in heterozygous patients, and treatment response in children with the mutation was better than in children with no mutation. Mutation screening for finding deafness causing mutations in the GJB2 gene is a useful predictor of post-implantation speech perception. We suggest microarray or other advanced mutation detection methods for assessment of other genes that might be responsible for non syndromic deafness.	4
An amino-acid substitution involved in phenylketonuria is in linkage disequilibrium with DNA haplotype 2. || Alleles Amino Acid Sequence DNA Europe Haplotypes Humans Mutation Nucleic Acid Hybridization Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1). PKU is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a PKU allele. To define the molecular basis of PKU, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90% of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes. We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (Arg to Trp) at residue 408 of PAH. Direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20% of mutant PAH genes.	3
Comparison of modules of wild type and mutant Huntingtin and TP53 protein interaction networks: implications in biological processes and functions. || Algorithms Computer Simulation Humans Huntingtin Protein Huntington Disease Models, Biological Mutation Nerve Tissue Proteins Protein Binding Protein Interaction Maps Reproducibility of Results Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Disease-causing mutations usually change the interacting partners of mutant proteins. In this article, we propose that the biological consequences of mutation are directly related to the alteration of corresponding protein protein interaction networks (PPIN). Mutation of Huntingtin (HTT) which causes Huntington's disease (HD) and mutations to TP53 which is associated with different cancers are studied as two example cases. We construct the PPIN of wild type and mutant proteins separately and identify the structural modules of each of the networks. The functional role of these modules are then assessed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for biological processes (BPs). We find that a large number of significantly enriched ([Formula: see text]) GO terms in mutant PPIN were absent in the wild type PPIN indicating the gain of BPs due to mutation. Similarly some of the GO terms enriched in wild type PPIN cease to exist in the modules of mutant PPIN, representing the loss. GO terms common in modules of mutant and wild type networks indicate both loss and gain of BPs. We further assign relevant biological function(s) to each module by classifying the enriched GO terms associated with it. It turns out that most of these biological functions in HTT networks are already known to be altered in HD and those of TP53 networks are altered in cancers. We argue that gain of BPs, and the corresponding biological functions, are due to new interacting partners acquired by mutant proteins. The methodology we adopt here could be applied to genetic diseases where mutations alter the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins.	0
Modulation of the vitamin D3 response by cancer-associated mutant p53. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus Cholecalciferol Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Promoter Regions, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vitamin D Response Element || The p53 gene is mutated in many human tumors. Cells of such tumors often contain abundant mutant p53 (mutp53) protein, which may contribute actively to tumor progression via a gain-of-function mechanism. We applied ChIP-on-chip analysis and identified the vitamin D receptor (VDR) response element as overrepresented in promoter sequences bound by mutp53. We report that mutp53 can interact functionally and physically with VDR. Mutp53 is recruited to VDR-regulated genes and modulates their expression, augmenting the transactivation of some genes and relieving the repression of others. Furthermore, mutp53 increases the nuclear accumulation of VDR. Importantly, mutp53 converts vitamin D into an antiapoptotic agent. Thus, p53 status can determine the biological impact of vitamin D on tumor cells.	0
Biochemical and functional characterization of germ line KRAS mutations. || Amino Acid Substitution Animals COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops Genes, ras Germ Cells Guanosine Triphosphate Humans Mice Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Recombinant Fusion Proteins Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Germ line missense mutations in HRAS and KRAS and in genes encoding molecules that function up- or downstream of Ras in cellular signaling networks cause a group of related developmental disorders that includes Costello syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. We performed detailed biochemical and functional studies of three mutant K-Ras proteins (P34R, D153V, and F156L) found in individuals with Noonan syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. Mutant K-Ras proteins demonstrate a range of gain-of-function effects in different cell types, and biochemical analysis supports the idea that the intrinsic Ras guanosine nucleotide triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, the responsiveness of these proteins to GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation all regulate developmental programs in vivo.	0
Mutant p53 induces the GEF-H1 oncogene, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 for RhoA, resulting in accelerated cell proliferation in tumor cells. || Bone Neoplasms Cell Growth Processes Cell Line, Tumor Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors Humans Mutation Osteosarcoma Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 rhoA GTP-Binding Protein || The tumor suppressor gene p53 is known to induce G1-S and G2-M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by transactivating various wild-type (WT) p53 regulatory genes. Mutational inactivation of p53 is detected in more than half of human cancers, depriving the p53 protein of its tumor-suppressive functions. Recent studies have shown that mutant p53 provides tumor cells with gain-of-function properties, such as accelerated cell proliferation, increased metastasis, and apoptosis resistance. However, the mechanism underlying the elevated tumorigenicity by p53 mutation remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we showed that GEF-H1, a guanine exchange factor-H1 for RhoA, is transcriptionally activated by the induction of mutant p53 proteins, thereby accelerating tumor cell proliferation. Osteosarcoma U2OS cell lines, which express inducible p53 mutants (V157F, R175H, and R248Q), were established, and the expression profiles of each cell line were then analyzed to detect genes specifically induced by mutant p53. We identified GEF-H1 as one of the consensus genes whose expression was significantly induced by the three mutants. The GEF-H1 expression level strongly correlated with p53 status in a panel of 32 cancer cell lines, and GEF-H1 induction caused activation of RhoA. Furthermore, growth of mutant p53 cells was dependent on GEF-H1 expression, whereas that of WT p53 cells was not. These results suggest that increased GEF-H1 expression contributes to the tumor progression phenotype associated with the p53 mutation.	0
Quantification of mutant E-cadherin using bioimaging analysis of in situ fluorescence microscopy. A new approach to CDH1 missense variants. || Cadherins Cell Line Genetic Counseling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Microscopy, Fluorescence Molecular Imaging Mutation, Missense Stomach Neoplasms || Missense mutations result in full-length proteins containing an amino acid substitution that can be neutral or deleterious, interfering with the normal conformation, localization, and function of a protein. A striking example is the presence of CDH1 (E-cadherin gene) germline missense variants in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), which represent a clinical burden for genetic counseling and surveillance of mutation carriers and their families. CDH1 missense variants can compromise not only the function of E-cadherin but also its expression pattern. Here, we propose a novel method to characterize E-cadherin signature in order to identify cases with E-cadherin deregulation and functional impairment. The strategy includes a bioimaging pipeline to quantify the expression level and characterize the distribution of the protein from in situ immunofluorescence images. The algorithm computes 1D (dimension intensity) radial and internuclear fluorescence profiles to generate expression outlines and 2D virtual cells representing a typical cell within the populations analyzed. Using this new approach, we verify that cells expressing mutant forms of E-cadherin display fluorescence profiles distinct from those of the wild-type cells. Mutant proteins showed a significantly decrease of fluorescence intensity at the membrane and often abnormal expression peaks in the cytoplasm, reflecting the underlying molecular mechanism of trafficking deregulation. Our results suggest employing this methodology as a complementary approach to evaluate the pathogenicity of E-cadherin missense variants. Moreover, it can be applied to a wide range of proteins and, more importantly, to diseases characterized by aberrant protein expression or trafficking deregulation.	0
[GJB2 gene mutation in deaf patients]. ||  || To detect the GJB2 gene mutation in patients with autosomal-recessive deafness, and analyze the relationship between clinical phenotype and gene mutation. Forty-two patients were examined clinically by pure tone audiometry, acoustic impedance and auditory brainstem response. The complete coding region of the GJB2 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the PCR products were subjected to automatic DNA sequencing. Two cases had homozygous mutation of 235delC. One of them had sensorineural hearing loss while the other had mixed hearing loss. Heterozygous mutation of 176del16bp was detected in a pair of twins who had mixed hearing loss. The 109G to A, 79G to A and 341A to G mutations were observed in both the patients and the controls. Homozygous 235delC mutation is one of the pathogeni c mutations which could occur in patients with mixed hearing loss. The heterozygous 176del16bp mutation combined with environmental factor may cause hearing loss. The 109G to A, 79G to A and 341A to G variants were considered to be polymorphisms of the GJB2 gene.	4
Further characterisation of the recently described SLC26A4 c.918+2T>C mutation and reporting of a novel variant predicted to be damaging. || Female Genetic Variation Goiter, Nodular Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Sulfate Transporters || Pendred syndrome (PS) is the second most common type of autosomal recessive syndromic hearing loss (HL). It is characterised by sensorineural HL and goiter with occasional hypothyroidism. These features are generally accompanied by malformations of the inner ear, as enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA). In about 50% of probands, mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are the cause of the disease. Here we report the case of a Portuguese female, aged 47, presenting with severe to profound HL and hypothyroidism. Her mother and sister, both deceased, had suffered from HL and goiter. By MRI and CT, an enlarged vestibular aqueduct and endolymphatic sac were observed. Molecular study of the patient included screening for GJB2 coding mutations and GJB6 common deletions followed by screening of all SLC26A4 exons, as well as intronic regions 8 and 14. Mutation c.918+2T>C was found for the first time in homozygosity in the intronic region 7 of the SLC26A4 gene. Whilst sequencing the control samples, a novel mutation c.821C>G was found in heterozygosity in the exon 7 of SLC26A4 gene and was predicted to be damaging. This study thus led to the finding of two novel SLC26A4 genotypes and provides new insight on the phenotypic features associated with PS.	1
Detection of B-RAF and N-RAS mutations in human melanoma. || Biomarkers, Tumor Biopsy, Fine-Needle Blotting, Southern Cell Line, Tumor DNA, Complementary Electrophoresis, Agar Gel Genes, ras Humans Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Paraffin Embedding Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf RNA, Messenger RNA, Neoplasm Sensitivity and Specificity Skin Neoplasms || It is now known that activating point mutations in components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway commonly occur in melanoma. We previously described a method to detect point mutations in heterogenous tissues containing both wild-type and mutant B-RAF and N-RAS genes by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce new restrictions sites in the cDNA sequence when the specific point mutations are present. We modified this technique to improve sensitivity and used it to determine the incidence of B-RAF and N-RAS mutations in human melanoma. We screened 115 melanoma samples for the most common B-RAF and N-RAS mutations found in melanoma using a site-directed mutagenesis-based detection technique. Southern blotting was used to increase sensitivity of the basic system. We also tested this method of genetic mutation detection in fine-needle aspiration specimens and paraffin-embedded tissues. Sixty-eight samples (20 of 36 primaries, 18 of 27 regional metastases, 16 of 40 nodal metastases, and 9 of 12 distant metastases) harbored the V599E B-RAF mutation (59%), 17 contained a Q61R N-RAS mutation, and 4 contained a Q61K N-RAS mutation. We were able to detect the V599E mutation in genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded melanoma samples and could routinely detect this mutation in fine-needle aspirations of melanoma tumors. This method of detection was sensitive and specific with no false positives. Activating mutations of B-RAF and N-RAS were present in approximately 60% and 18%, respectively, of samples tested. The site-directed mutagenesis system of mutation detection was both sensitive and specific in detecting these mutations and will likely prove very clinically useful in future studies.	0
T2D and Depression Risk Gene Proteasome Modulator 9 is Linked to Insomnia. || Depression Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Humans Italy Linkage Disequilibrium Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders Statistics, Nonparametric || Insomnia increases type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk. The 12q24 locus is linked to T2D, depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety. At the 12q24 locus, the Proteasome-Modulator 9 (PSMD9) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs74421874 [intervening sequence (IVS) 3+nt460-G>A], rs3825172 (IVS3+nt437-C>T) and rs14259 (E197G-A>G) are linked to: T2D, depression, anxiety, maturity-onset-diabetes-of the young 3/MODY3, obesity, waist circumference, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, T2D-macrovascular disease, T2D-microvascular disease, T2D-neuropathy, T2D-carpal-tunnel syndrome, T2D-nephropathy, T2D-retinopathy and non-diabetic retinopathy. PSMD9 SNP rs1043307/rs14259 (E197G-A>G) plays a role in anti-depressant therapy response, depression and schizophrenia. We aimed at determining PSMD9 rs74421874/rs3825172/rs14259 SNPs potential linkage to primary insomnia and sleep hours in T2D families. We recruited 200 Italian T2D families phenotyping them for primary insomnia and sleep hours per night. PSMD9-T2D-risk SNPs rs74421874/rs3825172 and rs1043307/rs14259 were tested for linkage with insomnia and sleep hours. Non-parametric-linkage analysis, linkage-disequilibrium-model analysis, single-SNP analysis, cluster-based-parametric analysis, quantitative-trait and variant-component analysis were performed using Merlin software. To validate data, 1000 replicates were executed for the significant non-parametric data. PSMD9 rs74421874 (IVS3+nt460-G>A), rs3825172 (IVS3+nt437-C>T) and rs1043307/rs14259 (E197G-A>G) SNPs are linked to insomnia in our Italian families.	4
Using protein design algorithms to understand the molecular basis of disease caused by protein-DNA interactions: the Pax6 example. || Algorithms Amino Acid Sequence Binding Sites DNA Disease Eye Proteins Homeodomain Proteins Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense PAX6 Transcription Factor Paired Box Transcription Factors Protein Engineering Protein Structure, Tertiary Repressor Proteins || Quite often a single or a combination of protein mutations is linked to specific diseases. However, distinguishing from sequence information which mutations have real effects in the protein's function is not trivial. Protein design tools are commonly used to explain mutations that affect protein stability, or protein-protein interaction, but not for mutations that could affect protein-DNA binding. Here, we used the protein design algorithm FoldX to model all known missense mutations in the paired box domain of Pax6, a highly conserved transcription factor involved in eye development and in several diseases such as aniridia. The validity of FoldX to deal with protein-DNA interactions was demonstrated by showing that high levels of accuracy can be achieved for mutations affecting these interactions. Also we showed that protein-design algorithms can accurately reproduce experimental DNA-binding logos. We conclude that 88% of the Pax6 mutations can be linked to changes in intrinsic stability (77%) and/or to its capabilities to bind DNA (30%). Our study emphasizes the importance of structure-based analysis to understand the molecular basis of diseases and shows that protein-DNA interactions can be analyzed to the same level of accuracy as protein stability, or protein-protein interactions.	0
Genomic characteristics of trastuzumab-resistant Her2-positive metastatic breast cancer. || Antineoplastic Agents Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Humans Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Receptor, ErbB-2 Retrospective Studies Trastuzumab || Resistance to trastuzumab therapy is linked to phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation. One key downstream effector and regulator of this pathway is the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). In 2011, a phase I/II study evaluated the combination of trastuzumab and everolimus (a mTOR inhibitor) for treatment of Her2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) for patients who had progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy. We retrospectively analyzed GeneChip microarray data from 22 of 47 patients included in the study. Using an unbiased approach, we found that mutations in BRAF, EGFR and KIT are significantly more common in this heavily treated population when compared with the cohort of invasive breast carcinoma patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Furthermore, 10 out of 22 patients had PIK3CA mutations (45.4%) but PI3KCA status was not predictive of PFS in our cohort. Finally, the use of OncoScantm has allowed us to detected mutations in five genes that have not been shown to be mutated in TCGA subset of Her-2 overexpressing breast cancer: CTNNB1, HRAS, KRAS, NF2 and SMARCB1. Mutational burden in heavily treated trastuzumab-resistant Her2-positive metastatic breast cancer is highly variable and not directly correlated with outcome. Activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway through mutations in EGFR, BRAF or KIT may mediate resistance to trastuzumab.	4
The oncogenic role of circPVT1 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is mediated through the mutant p53/YAP/TEAD transcription-competent complex. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinogenesis Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans MicroRNAs Models, Biological Multiprotein Complexes Mutation Oncogenes Phenotype Phosphoproteins Prognosis Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding RNA RNA Transport RNA, Long Noncoding Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Circular RNAs are a class of endogenous RNAs with various functions in eukaryotic cells. Worthy of note, circular RNAs play a critical role in cancer. Currently, nothing is known about their role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The identification of circular RNAs in HNSCC might become useful for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in HNSCC. Using samples from 115 HNSCC patients, we find that circPVT1 is over-expressed in tumors compared to matched non-tumoral tissues, with particular enrichment in patients with TP53 mutations. circPVT1 up- and down-regulation determine, respectively, an increase and a reduction of the malignant phenotype in HNSCC cell lines. We show that circPVT1 expression is transcriptionally enhanced by the mut-p53/YAP/TEAD complex. circPVT1 acts as an oncogene modulating the expression of miR-497-5p and genes involved in the control of cell proliferation. This study shows the oncogenic role of circPVT1 in HNSCC, extending current knowledge about the role of circular RNAs in cancer.	0

[Mutation analysis of the PAH gene in children with phenylketonuria from the Qinghai area of China]. ||  || To study the mutation characteristics of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in children with phenylketonuria (PKU) from the Qinghai area of China, in order to provide basic information for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Mutations of the PAH gene were detected in the promoter and exons 1-13 and their flanking intronic sequences of PAH gene by PCR and DNA sequencing in 49 children with PKU and their parents from the Qinghai area of China. A total of 30 different mutations were detected in 80 out of 98 mutant alleles (82%), including 19 missense (63%), 5 nonsense (17%), 3 splice-site (10%) and 3 deletions (10%). Most mutations were detected in exons 3, 6, 7, 11 and intron 4 of PAH gene. The most frequent mutations were p.R243Q (19%), IVS4-1G>A (9%), p.Y356X (7%) and p.EX6-96A>G(5%). Two novel mutations p.N93fsX5 (c.279-282delCATC) and p.G171E (c.512G>A) were found. p.H64fsX9(c.190delC) was documented for the second time in Chinese PAH gene. The mutation spectrum of the gene PAH in the Qinghai population was similar to that in other populations in North China while significantly different from that in the populations from some provinces in southern China, Japan and Europe. The mutations of PAH gene in the Qinghai area of China demonstrate a unique diversity, complexity and specificity.	3
[Clinical characteristics and gene mutation analysis of one pedigree with infantile glycogen storage disease type II]. || Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant Mutation Pedigree alpha-Glucosidases || The clinical data of 2 infants with infantile glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II) from one pedigree were collected. The method of dried blood spots (DBS) was applied to collect peripheral blood samples, and the activity of acid alpha-D-glucosidase (GAA) in leukocytes was measured. The coding region of GAA gene in this pedigree was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then direct sequencing was used to analyze mutations in GAA gene. The two infants were twins, who were admitted to the hospital due to feeding difficulties, generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia, cardiomegaly, and cardiac insufficiency when they were 10 months old. The GAA activity in leukocytes in the two infants was significantly lower than in normal controls. Gene sequencing revealed 2 compound heterozygous mutations in the two infants, i.e., G1942A and G2214A, respectively. G1942A had been proved pathogenic, and the latter one, G2214A, was a nonsense mutation, resulting in the change of tryptophan, the 738th amino acid of GAA, into a stop codon. The two infants were diagnosed with GSD II by gene detection and no enzyme replacement therapy could be provided to them. Follow-up visits showed that the two infants died at home at the age of 15 months and 17 months, respectively. GSD II is caused by deficiency of GAA activity resulting from mutation of GAA gene. The detection of GAA activity in peripheral blood by DBS and GAA gene detection are effective and feasible methods for diagnosis of GSD II.	1
Rapid colorimetric detection of p53 protein function using DNA-gold nanoconjugates with applications for drug discovery and cancer diagnostics. ||  || The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a central role in preventing cancer through interaction with DNA response elements (REs) to regulate target gene expression in cells. Due to its significance in cancer biology, relentless efforts have been directed toward understanding p53-DNA interactions for the development of cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. In this paper, we report a rapid, label-free and versatile colorimetric assay to detect wildtype p53 DNA-binding function in complex solutions. The assay design is based on a concept that alters interparticle-distances between RE-AuNPs from a crosslinking effect induced through tetramerization of wildtype p53 protein (p53-WT) upon binding to canonical DNA motifs modified on gold nanoparticles (RE-AuNPs). This leads to a visible solution color change from red to blue, which is quantifiable by the UV- visible absorption spectra with a detection limit of 5 nM. Contrastingly, no color change was observed for the binding-deficient p53 mutants and non-specific proteins due to their inability to crosslink RE-AuNPs. Based on this sensing principle, we further demonstrate its utility for fast detection of drug-induced DNA binding function to cancer-associated Y220C mutant p53 protein using well-established reactivating compounds. By exploiting the dominant-negative property of mutant p53 over p53-WT and interactions with RE-AuNPs, this assay is configurable to detect low numbers of mutant p53 expressing cells in miniscule sample fractions obtained from typical core needle biopsy-sized tissues without signal attrition, alluding to the potential for biopsy sampling in cancer diagnostics or for defining cancer margins. This nanogold enabled colorimetric assay provides a facile yet robust method for studying important parameters influencing p53-DNA interactions with great promises for clinically pertinent applications.	0
Reporting the presence of three different diseases causing GJB2 mutations in a consanguineous deaf family. ||  || This paper reports a consanguineous deaf family with three different mutations in the GJB2 gene. Four members of an Iranian deaf family were recruited in this study. The GJB2 coding region and exon-intron boundaries were investigated using direct sequencing. The proposita was a 12-year-old girl with congenital non-syndromic hearing loss. She was born to consanguineous parents. The proposita, her parents and deaf maternal uncle were screened for GJB2 mutations. Sequencing demonstrated the presence of the c.176_191del and c.327_328delGGinsA mutations in the proposita, the c.176_191del mutation in her father, and the c.35delG and c.327_328delGGinsA mutations in trans in her apparently unaffected mother as well as in her congenitally deaf uncle. Follow-up pure-tone audiometry revealed moderate to severe mid- and high-frequency hearing loss in the mother. This study shows the complexity of genetic testing and counseling for hearing loss.	4
TSNAD: an integrated software for cancer somatic mutation and tumour-specific neoantigen detection. ||  || Tumour antigens have attracted much attention because of their importance to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapy. With the development of cancer genomics, the identification of tumour-specific neoantigens became possible, which is a crucial step for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we developed software called the tumour-specific neoantigen detector for detecting cancer somatic mutations following the best practices of the genome analysis toolkit and predicting potential tumour-specific neoantigens, which could be either extracellular mutations of membrane proteins or mutated peptides presented by class I major histocompatibility complex molecules. This pipeline was beneficial to the biologist with little programmatic background. We also applied the software to the somatic mutations from the International Cancer Genome Consortium database to predict numerous potential tumour-specific neoantigens. This software is freely available from https://github.com/jiujiezz/tsnad.	4
Identification of Fabry Disease in a Tertiary Referral Cohort of Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. ||  || Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficient activity of α-galactosidase A due to mutations in the GLA gene, which may be associated with increased left ventricular wall thickness and mimic the morphologic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Management strategies for these 2 diseases diverge, with Fabry disease-specific treatment utilizing recombinant α-galactosidase A enzyme replacement therapy. We studied a prospectively assembled consecutive cohort of 585 patients (71% male) from 2 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tertiary referral centers by screening for low α-galactosidase A activity in dried blood spots. Male patients with low α-galactosidase A activity levels and all females were tested for mutations in the GLA gene. In 585 patients previously diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we identified 2 unrelated patients (0.34%), both with the GLA mutation encoding P.N215S, the most common mutation causing later-onset Fabry disease phenotype. These patients were both asymptomatic, a man aged 53 years and a woman aged 69 years, and demonstrated a mild cardiac phenotype with symmetric distribution of left ventricular hypertrophy. After family screening, a total of 27 new Fabry disease patients aged 2-81 years were identified in the 2 families, including 12 individuals who are now receiving enzyme replacement therapy. These observations support consideration for routine prospective screening for Fabry disease in all patients without a definitive etiology for left ventriclar hypertrophy. This strategy would likely result, through cascade family testing, in the earlier identification of new Fabry disease-affected males and female heterozygotes who may benefit from monitoring and/or enzyme replacement therapy.	3
Therapeutic prospects for p73 and p63: rising from the shadow of p53. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents DNA Damage DNA-Binding Proteins Genetic Therapy Humans Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Protein Conformation Signal Transduction Structure-Activity Relationship Trans-Activators Transcription Factors Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The p53 protein family consists of three transcription factors: p53, p63, and p73. These proteins share significant structural and functional similarities and each has unique biological functions as well. Although the role of p53 in cellular stress is extensively studied, many questions remain about p63 and p73. In this review we summarize current data on functional interactions within the p53 family, their regulation and roles in response to genotoxic stress. We also discuss the significance of p73 and p63 for cancer therapy and outline novel approaches in development of therapeutic drugs that specifically target the p53 family.	0
Pre-clinical efficacy and synergistic potential of the MDM2-p53 antagonists, Nutlin-3 and RG7388, as single agents and in combined treatment with cisplatin in ovarian cancer. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Cisplatin DNA Repair Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genotype Humans Imidazoles Ovarian Neoplasms Piperazines Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Pyrrolidines Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 para-Aminobenzoates || Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related female deaths. Due to serious side effects, relapse and resistance to standard chemotherapy, better and more targeted approaches are required. Mutation of the TP53 gene accounts for 50% of all human cancers. In the remaining malignancies, non-genotoxic activation of wild-type p53 by small molecule inhibition of the MDM2-p53 binding interaction is a promising therapeutic strategy. Proof of concept was established with the cis-imidazoline Nutlin-3, leading to the development of RG7388 and other compounds currently in early phase clinical trials. This preclinical study evaluated the effect of Nutlin-3 and RG7388 as single agents and in combination with cisplatin in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. Median-drug-effect analysis showed Nutlin-3 or RG7388 combination with cisplatin was additive to, or synergistic in a p53-dependent manner, resulting in increased p53 activation, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, associated with increased p21WAF1 protein and/or caspase-3/7 activity compared to cisplatin alone. Although MDM2 inhibition activated the expression of p53-dependent DNA repair genes, the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of p53 dominated the response. These data indicate that combination treatment with MDM2 inhibitors and cisplatin has synergistic potential for the treatment of ovarian cancer, dependent on cell genotype.	0
Kinetic mechanisms of mutation-dependent Harvey Ras activation and their relevance for the development of Costello syndrome. || Amino Acid Sequence Amino Acid Substitution Animals Binding Sites Biocatalysis Costello Syndrome Enzyme Activation Guanosine Diphosphate Guanosine Triphosphate Humans Hydrolysis Kinetics Mice Molecular Sequence Data Mutant Proteins NIH 3T3 Cells Protein Structure, Secondary Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Recombinant Proteins Signal Transduction p120 GTPase Activating Protein ras-GRF1 || Costello syndrome is linked to activating mutations of a residue in the p-loop or the NKCD/SAK motifs of Harvey Ras (HRas). More than 10 HRas mutants that induce Costello syndrome have been identified; G12S HRas is the most prevalent of these. However, certain HRas p-loop mutations also are linked to cancer formation that are exemplified with G12V HRas. Despite these relations, specific links between types of HRas mutations and diseases evade definition because some Costello syndrome HRas p-loop mutations, such as G12S HRas, also often cause cancer. This study established novel kinetic parameter-based equations that estimate the value of the cellular fractions of the GTP-bound active form of HRas mutant proteins. Such calculations differentiate between two basic kinetic mechanisms that populate the GTP-bound form of Ras in cells. (i) The increase in the level of GTP-bound Ras is caused by the HRas mutation-mediated perturbation of the intrinsic kinetic characteristics of Ras. This generates a broad spectrum of the population of the GTP-bound form of HRas that typically causes Costello syndrome. The upper end of this spectrum of HRas mutants, as exemplified by G12S HRas, can also cause cancer. (ii) The increase in the level of GTP-bound Ras occurs because the HRas mutations perturb the action of p120GAP on Ras. This causes production of a significantly high population of the only GTP-bound form of HRas linked merely to cancer formation. HRas mutant G12V belongs to this category.	0
GJB2 sequencing in deaf and profound sensorineural hearing loss children. ||  || GJB2 mutations are the most frequent reason of genetic congenital hearing loss. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of GJB2 mutations in the deaf and profound hearing loss children. The material of the study was a group of 61 patients divided into two groups. Group I - 35 deaf or with profound sensorineural hearing loss children (the pupils of the deaf and hard of hearing school), aged 5-17 years (average 9.2 years), 14 males, 21 females, II - control group comprised 26 normal hearing patients, aged 5-16 years (average 10.4years), 14 males, 12 females (patients of Department of Pediatric Otolaryngology, Audiology and Phoniatrics, Medical University of Lodz). In both groups, exon 2 sequencing of GJB2 gene was performed. In group I in 6 patients (17%) 35delG in GJB2 gene was found. The patients were homozygotes, with negative family history of hearing loss. No other mutations in GJB2 gene were found. In group II no mutations in GJB2 were observed. The most frequent cause of hearing impairment in the deaf and profound sensorineural hearing loss children was 35delG mutation in GJB2 gene. No other mutations in GJB2 gene were detected.	4
The association of lipid metabolism relative gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke in Han and Uighur population of Xinjiang. || Aged Alleles Apolipoprotein A-V Asian Continental Ancestry Group Brain Ischemia China Cholesterol Ester Transfer Proteins Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Lipid Metabolism Lipoprotein Lipase Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Stroke || The present study is aimed to evaluate difference of lipid metabolism related gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with ischemic stroke (IS) in Han and Uighur population of Xinjiang, China. Four hundred eight patients with ischemic stroke and 347 unrelated healthy individuals of age and sex matched were genotyped for Apolipoprotein A5 (ApoA5), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) genes. Their mutation difference was analyzed by SNaP shot techniques. GeneMapper4.1 SPSS20.0 software was used for data management and analysis. Using a single locus analysis, the distribution difference of genotype loci in ischemic stroke cases and controls were detected to assess the genetic risk factors of ischemic stroke. Significance differences of genotype distribution in ischemic stroke cases and controls were observed in LDLR rs688 in Han and Uighur population in recessive model from analysis of single gene locus. It also was found that dramatic difference of triglyceride (TG) of LPL rs328 and systolic blood pressure in CETP rs708277 of total population. In binary logistic regression analysis of total studied population, ischemic stroke was observed significantly associated with LDLR rs688 both addictive model (TT/CC, adjusted OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.04-2.07) and recessive model (TT/CT + CC, adjusted Odds ratio (OR) = 2.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.37-5.14). In Han population, ischemic stroke was observed significantly associated with rs688 both in addictive model (TT/CC, adjusted OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.06-10.05). In Uighur population, no significant association was found between gene polymorphisms and the risk of ischemic stroke. Combined analysis of multiple gene and loci, interaction effects of LDLR rs688 C/T, ApoA5 rs662799 A/G and CETP rs708272 C/T denoted a significant influence on IS susceptibility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of lipid metabolism relative gene were significantly associated with the morbidity of ischemic stroke in Han population. The interaction effects of rs688 C/T with ApoA5 rs662799 A/G and CETP rs708272 C/T promoted the occurrence of IS.	4
Genetic Aetiology of Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss in Moravia-Silesia. ||  || Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. The aim of this study was to clarify the genetic aetiology of nonsyndromic hearing loss in the Moravian-Silesian population of the Czech Republic. This study included 200 patients (93 males, 107 females, mean age 16.9 years, ranging from 4 months to 62 years) with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. We screened all patients for mutations in GJB2 and the large deletion del(GJB6-D13S1830). We performed further screening for additional genes (SERPINB6,TMIE,COCH,ESPN,ACTG1,KCNQ4, andGJB3) with Sanger sequencing on a subset of patients that were negative forGJB2 mutations. We detected biallelic GJB2 mutations in 44 patients (22%). Among these patients, 63.6%, 9.1% and 2.3% exhibited homozygous c.35delG, p.Trp24*, and p.Met34Thr mutations, respectively. The remaining 25% of these patients exhibited compound heterozygous c.35delG, c.-23+1G>A, p.Trp24*, p.Val37Ile, p.Met34Thr, p.Leu90Pro, c.235delC, c.313_326del14, p.Ser139Asn, and p.Gly147Leu mutations. We found a monoallelicGJB2 mutation in 12 patients (6.6%). We found no pathogenic mutations in the other tested genes.Conclusions: One fifth of our cohort had deafness related toGJB2 mutations. The del(GJB6-D13S1830),SERPINB6,TMIE,COCH,ESPN,ACTG1,GJB3, andKCNQ4 mutations were infrequently associated with deafness in the Moravian-Silesian population. Therefore, we suggest that del(GJB6-D13S1830) testing should be performed only when patients with deafness carry the monoallelicGJB2 mutation.	4
Molecular analysis of exons 6 and 7 of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in Phenylketonuria patients in Western Iran. || Iran kermanshah mutation detection phenylalanine hydroxylase phenylketonuria || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism that results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). According to PAH database, exons 6 and 7 and their flanking introns of PAH gene contain the greatest number of mutant alleles. Therefore, as a preliminary study, nucleotide sequence analysis of exons 6 and 7 of the PAH gene has been performed in 25 PKU patients whose ancestors lived in Kermanshah province of Iran. To date, there has been no mutation data describing the genotypes of the PKU disease in this Kurdish ethnic region background. Twenty-five patients (aged between 2 and 23 years) participated in this study. The DNA fragments containing two exons of the PAH gene [6 and 7] and their exon-flanking intronic sequences were amplified and sequenced. The total of detected mutations were R261X (8%), R176X (4%), R243Q (4%), R243X (2%) and R261Q (2%), as they accounted for 20% of all mutant alleles in this study. The identified polymorphisms are: IVS5 -54 G > A (22%), Q232Q (8%) and V245V (4%). All of the detected mutations in this study are related to CpG dinucleotides in the PAH gene sequence. The frequency of R261X, the most common mutation in our study, in Iranian population is <5%. Furthermore, there is no report of detection of R176X and R243Q in Isfahan and Azeri Turkish populations. These findings confirm the common Mediterranean mutations in this local population, although with more or lower frequencies than those reported in other related studies in Iran. Therefore, it may be necessary to study the PAH gene mutations in other provinces of Iran separately.	3
Battle against cancer: an everlasting saga of p53. || Animals Drug Discovery Humans Mutant Proteins Neoplasms Ribosomes Stress, Physiological Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cancer is one of the most life-threatening diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of malignant cells. The tumor suppressor p53 is the master regulator of tumor cell growth and proliferation. In response to various stress signals, p53 can be activated and transcriptionally induces a myriad of target genes, including both protein-encoding and non-coding genes, controlling cell cycle progression, DNA repair, senescence, apoptosis, autophagy and metabolism of tumor cells. However, around 50% of human cancers harbor mutant p53 and, in the majority of the remaining cancers, p53 is inactivated through multiple mechanisms. Herein, we review the recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of p53 signaling, particularly the newly identified ribosomal stress-p53 pathway, and the development of chemotherapeutics via activating wild-type p53 or restoring mutant p53 functions in cancer. A full understanding of p53 regulation will aid the development of effective cancer treatments.	0
Characterization of phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles in untreated phenylketonuria patients from Victoria, Australia: origin of alleles and haplotypes. || Alleles Australia Chromosomes, Human European Continental Ancestry Group Exons Female Gene Frequency Haplotypes Humans Ireland Male Mutation Pedigree Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Scotland Sequence Analysis, DNA || Mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene were identified in a group of untreated phenylketonuria patients from Victoria, Australia. Ninety-eight percent of the alleles were identified, and a total of 26 different mutations were detected on 83 independent chromosomes. The three most prevalent mutations--R408W, I65T, and IVS12nt1--together accounted for 54% of the alleles. A number of alleles were demonstrated, by genealogical studies, to be of Irish or Scottish origin, including a newly described mutation 1197/1198 del A. The distribution and relative frequencies of the more common alleles in this population parallel observed frequencies in the British Isles and are consistent with the known history of Caucasian settlement of this region of Australia. We have analyzed the haplotype and polymorphic short tandem-repeat allele of the mutant chromosomes and describe a number of new associations.	3
Phenotype-genotype correlation in 295 Chinese deaf subjects with biallelic causative mutations in the GJB2 gene. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Homozygote Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || The connexin 26 coding gene (GJB2) is the primary causative gene for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing impairment (NSSHI). More than 100 mutations in this gene have been reported to be linked to hearing impairment (HI), from mild to profound hearing loss. To precisely estimate the impact of GJB2 mutations in the Chinese population, a cross-sectional study was performed to analyze the auditory data of Chinese patients with NSSHI. Two hundred ninety-five unrelated patients with NSSHI with biallelic mutations in GJB2 were recruited from seven provinces in Northern China from 2004 to 2008. The levels of HI and average pure tone audiometry were compared across different genotypes by χ(2) testing. The subjects with the genotypes of combined truncating mutations had more cases of severe HI than the subjects with a genotype of several nontruncating mutations. It was also revealed that subjects carrying either c.[79G>A; 341A>G]+[79G>A; 341A>G] or c.[109G>A]+[79G>A; 341A>G] had significantly fewer cases of severe HI than the reference group of homozygous c.235delC, whereas the subjects carrying c.[235delC]+[176_191del16] had more cases of severe HI than the homozygous c.235delC group. This is the first study to clarify the correlations between different GJB2 biallelic genotypes and NSSHI phenotype in the Chinese population. The Chinese subjects with two truncating mutations in GJB2 were shown to correlate with more severe HI.	4
Non-syndromic hearing impairment in a multi-ethnic population of Northeastern Brazil. || Adolescent Adult Aged Brazil Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Consanguinity Ethnic Groups Female Hearing Loss Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Orphan Nuclear Receptors Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Rural Population Young Adult || There are many hearing impaired individuals in Monte Santo, a rural municipality in the state of Bahia, Brazil, including multiple familial cases strongly suggestive of a genetic aetiology. The present study investigated 81 subjects with hearing impairment (HI) recruited from 36 families. Mutations often associated with HI, i.e. the DFNB1 mutations c.35delG in GJB2, deletions del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854), and A1555G in the mitochondrial gene MTRNR1 were initially analyzed, with additional mutations in GJB2 identified by sequencing the coding region of the gene. Seven different mutations were present in GJB2 with mutations c.35delG and p.Arg75Gln, which are known to be pathogenic, identified in 37.0% of the subjects. Individuals homozygous for the c.35delG mutation were diagnosed in eight families, corresponding to 24.7% of unrelated individuals with nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI), and an additional heterozygote for this mutation was present in a single family. Ten individuals (12.4%) in another family were heterozygous for the mutation p.Arg75Gln. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the alleles and patterns of NSHI inheritance among the subjects studied, probably due to the extensive inter-ethnic admixture that characterizes the peoples of Brazil, together with a high prevalence of community endogamy and consanguineous marriage.	4
Gene mutation and pedigree analysis of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency in a Uygur family of China. || Biopterin China DNA Mutational Analysis Ethnic Groups Female Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenylketonurias || Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4 ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, which is caused by an enzyme deficiency involved in its synthetic or metabolic pathways. Clinical symptoms may include microcephaly, hypoevolutism, severe ataxia, and seizures. The purposes of this study are to analyze the genotype-phenotype and the pedigree of the first case of BH4 deficiency in the Uygur of China. (a) This patient received tandem mass spectrometry, urinary neopterin and biopterin analysis, and determination of dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity in dried blood spots. (b) Blood DNA samples of this patient and her three family members were collected for gene sequencing and mutation analysis. (a) The basic urinary neopterin and biopterin were 1.07 mmol/mol Cr and 3.12 mmol/mol Cr, respectively, and biopterin percentage was 74.42%. The DHPR activity of this patient was 31.11% of normal control. (b) Sanger sequencing of PAH gene in this patient was negative but positive of her sister, which carries 2 heterozygous mutation c.781C>T and c.1238G>C. Next-generation sequencing on the patient identified a homozygous mutation in the quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) gene at c.508G>A, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. (a) The patient was the first case of clinical diagnosis of BH4 deficiency in the Uighur. And there are two types of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) in the same family. (b) The mild HPA patient with severe nervous system damage should pay more attention to the BH4 deficiency. (c) Using next-generation sequencing technology can increase the mutation detection rate when the hereditary diseases are highly suspected in clinic.	1 3
Frequency of the 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene in Turkish hearing-impaired patients. || Adolescent Child Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Humans Mutation Turkey || The 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) at the DFNB1 locus is the most common mutation in patients with autosomal-recessive sensorineural deafness. Genetic diagnosis is crucial for genetic counseling. We have developed an easy and simple method and screened a total of 235 unrelated hearing-impaired children. We found 48 of the subjects to be homozygous for the mutation, including 27 of 83 familial cases, 15 of 101 singletons, 4 of 9 subjects born to assortative marriages (deaf married to deaf), and 2 of 42 subjects for whom the parents claimed an environmental factor as the etiology of the condition. The high ratio of individuals homozygous for the mutation indicated that the 35delG mutation in the connexin gene accounts for more than 90% of the mutations at this locus.	4
A novel mutation (Cys308Phe) of the LDL receptor gene in families from the South-Eastern part of Poland. || Adult Aged Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence Chromosome Segregation DNA Mutational Analysis Endocytosis Exons Family Female Heterozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Pedigree Poland Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Binding Receptors, LDL || The purpose of this investigation was to characterize a new mutation in the LDL-receptor (LDLR) gene in three families with clinically diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) from the South-Eastern part of Poland. Mutational screening with exon by exon sequencing analysis was performed in all probands. The novel mutation c986G>T (Cys308Phe) in the exon 7 of LDLR gene was found in three apparently unrelated probands with FH. Analysis of the receptor activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes by binding and uptake of DiL-LDL showed a significant reduction (by 24% versus healthy control) of the fluorescent label in the lymphocytes of patients heterozygous for this mutation. Concentrations of serum LDL-C in probands before treatment were between 9.5 and 10.5 mmol/l. All patients had corneal arcus and tendon xanthoma. Clinically, families were characterized by premature coronary artery disease. This mutation occurred relatively frequently in our group of patients with FH, but this could be explained by a founder effect since we demonstrated their common ancestors.	4
Reanalysis of BRCA1/2 negative high risk ovarian cancer patients reveals novel germline risk loci and insights into missing heritability. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Cell Cycle DNA Repair Female Genetic Loci Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ Cells Humans Inheritance Patterns Male Middle Aged Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Pedigree Penetrance Risk Factors || While up to 25% of ovarian cancer (OVCA) cases are thought to be due to inherited factors, the majority of genetic risk remains unexplained. To address this gap, we sought to identify previously undescribed OVCA risk variants through the whole exome sequencing (WES) and candidate gene analysis of 48 women with ovarian cancer and selected for high risk of genetic inheritance, yet negative for any known pathogenic variants in either BRCA1 or BRCA2. In silico SNP analysis was employed to identify suspect variants followed by validation using Sanger DNA sequencing. We identified five pathogenic variants in our sample, four of which are in two genes featured on current multi-gene panels; (RAD51D, ATM). In addition, we found a pathogenic FANCM variant (R1931*) which has been recently implicated in familial breast cancer risk. Numerous rare and predicted to be damaging variants of unknown significance were detected in genes on current commercial testing panels, most prominently in ATM (n = 6) and PALB2 (n = 5). The BRCA2 variant p.K3326*, resulting in a 93 amino acid truncation, was overrepresented in our sample (odds ratio = 4.95, p = 0.01) and coexisted in the germline of these women with other deleterious variants, suggesting a possible role as a modifier of genetic penetrance. Furthermore, we detected loss of function variants in non-panel genes involved in OVCA relevant pathways; DNA repair and cell cycle control, including CHEK1, TP53I3, REC8, HMMR, RAD52, RAD1, POLK, POLQ, and MCM4. In summary, our study implicates novel risk loci as well as highlights the clinical utility for retesting BRCA1/2 negative OVCA patients by genomic sequencing and analysis of genes in relevant pathways.	4
Gli1-Mediated Regulation of Sox2 Facilitates Self-Renewal of Stem-Like Cells and Confers Resistance to EGFR Inhibitors in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. || Antineoplastic Agents Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Erlotinib Hydrochloride Gefitinib Hedgehog Proteins Humans Lung Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic Quinazolines RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering SOXB1 Transcription Factors Signal Transduction Spheroids, Cellular Stem Cells Transcription Factors Tumor Cells, Cultured Zinc Finger Protein GLI1 || Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have very low survival rates because the current therapeutic strategies are not fully effective. Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, patients invariably develop resistance to these agents. Alterations in multiple signaling cascades have been associated with the development of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Sonic Hedgehog and associated Gli transcription factors play a major role in embryonic development and have recently been found to be reactivated in NSCLC, and elevated Gli1 levels correlate with poor prognosis. The Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in the functions of cancer stem cells, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. In this context, we demonstrate that Gli1 is a strong regulator of embryonic stem cell transcription factor Sox2. Depletion of Gli1 or inhibition of the Hedgehog signaling significantly abrogated the self-renewal of stem-like side-population cells from NSCLCs as well as vascular mimicry of such cells. Gli1 was found to transcriptionally regulate Sox2 through its promoter region, and Gli1 could be detected on the Sox2 promoter. Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling appeared to work cooperatively with EGFR inhibitors in markedly reducing the viability of NSCLC cells as well as the self-renewal of stem-like cells. Thus, our study demonstrates a cooperative functioning of the EGFR signaling and Hedgehog pathways in governing the stem-like functions of NSCLC cancer stem cells and presents a novel therapeutic strategy to combat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations.	0
Ocular signs correlate well with disease severity and genotype in Fabry disease. || Adolescent Adult Child Cornea Fabry Disease Female Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Severity of Illness Index || Ocular signs in Fabry disease have generally been regarded to be primarily of diagnostic value. We explored whether ocular findings, alone or in particular in combination with the α-galactosidase A gene mutation, have predictive value for disease severity. Data from the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS), a large, global database sponsored by Shire, were selected for adult patients who had undergone ophthalmological examination. Three ocular signs were assessed: cornea verticillata, tortuous conjunctival and/or retinal vessels, and cataract. Fabry disease severity was measured using FOS Mainz Severity Score Index and modifications thereof. Ophthalmological data were available for 1203 (699 female, 504 male) adult patients with eye findings characteristic of Fabry disease in 55.1%. Cornea verticillata had a similar distribution in women (51.1%) and men (50.8%), whereas tortuous vessels and Fabry cataract were somewhat more frequent in men than in women. Patients with cornea verticillata, selected as the principal ocular sign for this study, had more severe disease (median score, 20.0) versus those without ocular signs (11.0; P<0.001). This finding could be confirmed by applying age adjusted severity scores. Moreover, the prevalence of cornea verticillata was significantly higher in patients with null (male, 76.9%; female, 64.5%) and missense (male, 79.2%; female, 67.4%) mutations versus mild missense (male, 17.1%; female, 23.1%) and the p.N215S (male, 15.0%; female, 15.6%) mutations (P<0.01). Our analyses show a correlation between the prevalence of ocular changes in Fabry disease and disease severity. Consequently, information on ocular findings and α-galactosidase A gene mutation may help assess the risk for more severe Fabry disease. These observed findings are of notable clinical importance, as Fabry disease is characterized by high clinical course variability and only weak genotype-phenotype correlation at the individual patient level. Further confirmatory studies are needed.	4
Molecular characterization of serous ovarian carcinoma using a multigene next generation sequencing cancer panel approach. || Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous Databases, Genetic Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Grading Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial Ovarian Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || High grade serous ovarian cancer is one of the poorly characterized malignancies. This study aimed to elucidate the mutational events in Malaysian patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer by performing targeted sequencing on 50 cancer hotspot genes. Nine high grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples and ten normal ovarian tissues were obtained from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC) and the Kajang Hospital. The Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 targeting "mutation-hotspot region" in 50 most common cancer-associated genes was utilized. A total of 20 variants were identified in 12 genes. Eleven (55%) were silent alterations and nine (45%) were missense mutations. Six of the nine missense mutations were predicted to be deleterious while the other three have low or neutral protein impact. Eight genes were altered in both the tumor and normal groups (APC, EGFR, FGFR3, KDR, MET, PDGFRA, RET and SMO) while four genes (TP53, PIK3CA, STK11 and KIT) were exclusively altered in the tumor group. TP53 alterations were present in all the tumors but not in the normal group. Six deleterious mutations in TP53 (p.R175H, p.H193R, p.Y220C, p.Y163C, p.R282G and p.Y234H) were identified in eight serous ovarian carcinoma samples and none in the normal group. TP53 remains as the most frequently altered gene in high grade serous ovarian cancer and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) in combination with Ion Ampliseq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 were proven to be instrumental in identifying a wide range of genetic alterations simultaneously from a minute amount of DNA. However, larger series of validation targeting more genes are necessary in order to shed a light on the molecular events underlying pathogenesis of this cancer.	4
Limited importance of the dominant-negative effect of TP53 missense mutations. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Databases, Genetic Humans Loss of Heterozygosity Mice Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Heterozygosity of TP53 missense mutations is related to the phenomenon of the dominant-negative effect (DNE). To estimate the importance of the DNE of TP53 mutations, we analysed the percentage of cancer cases showing a single heterozygous mutation of TP53 and searched for a cell line with a single heterozygous mutation of this gene. This approach was based on the knowledge that genes with evident DNE, such as EGFR and IDH1, represent nearly 100% of single heterozygous mutations in tumour specimens and cell lines. Genetic analyses (LOH and sequencing) performed for early and late passages of several cell lines originally described as showing single heterozygous TP53 mutations (H-318, G-16, PF-382, MOLT-13, ST-486 and LS-123). Statistical analysis of IARC TP53 and SANGER databases. Genetic analyses of N-RAS, FBXW7, PTEN and STR markers to test cross-contamination and cell line identity. Cell cloning, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and SSCP performed for the PF-382 cell line. A database study revealed TP53 single heterozygous mutations in 35% of in vivo (surgical and biopsy) samples and only 10% of cultured cells (in vitro), although those numbers appeared to be overestimated. We deem that published in vivo TP53 mutation analyses are not as rigorous as studies in vitro, and we did not find any cell line showing a stable, single heterozygous mutation. G16, PF-382 and MOLT-13 cells harboured single heterozygous mutations temporarily. ST-486, H-318 and LS-123 cell lines were misclassified. Specific mutations, such as R175H, R273H, R273L or R273P, which are reported in the literature to exert a DNE, showed the lowest percentage of single heterozygous mutations in vitro (about 5%). We suggest that the currently reported percentage of TP53 single heterozygous mutations in tumour samples and cancer cell lines is overestimated. Thus, the magnitude of the DNE of TP53 mutations is questionable. This scepticism is supported by database investigations showing that retention of the wild-type allele occurs with the same frequency as either nonsense or missense TP53 mutations.	0
Antitumor mechanisms when pRb and p53 are genetically inactivated. || Animals Carcinogenesis Cell Proliferation Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Mutation Neoplasms Retinoblastoma Protein Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || pRb and p53 are the two major tumor suppressors. Their inactivation is frequent when cancers develop and their reactivation is rationale of most cancer therapeutics. When pRb and p53 are genetically inactivated, cells irreparably lose the antitumor mechanisms afforded by them. Cancer genome studies document recurrent genetic inactivation of RB1 and TP53, and the inactivation becomes more frequent in more advanced cancers. These findings may explain why more advanced cancers are more likely to resist current therapies. Finding successful treatments for more advanced and multi-therapy-resistant cancers will depend on finding antitumor mechanisms that remain effective when pRb and p53 are genetically inactivated. Here, we review studies that have begun to make progress in this direction.	0
Phenylalanine hydroxylase gene: novel missense mutation in exon 7 causing severe phenylketonuria. || Animals Base Sequence Blotting, Western Cells, Cultured Exons Gene Expression Genes Haplotypes Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || By direct sequence analysis of 94 mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles using polymerase chain reaction-based techniques, we identified a C to T transition in exon 7 of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene that is associated with RFLP haplotypes 1 and 4. A leucine for proline substitution at position 281 can be predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the mutant codon. Expression analysis in cultured mammalian cells after site-directed mutagenesis proved that the base substitution is a disease causing gene lesion. Dot-blot hybridization analysis using allele-specific oligonucleotides revealed that 25% of all mutant haplotype 1 alleles in the German population bear this mutation. In addition, this mutation could be detected on one mutant haplotype 4 allele. The fact that this mutation is associated with only 25% of all mutant haplotype 1 alleles suggests that multiple mutations may be associated with this haplotype. The occurrence of several different mutations would be in agreement with the clinical heterogeneity observed in the group of patients whose PKU alleles belong to haplotype 1.	3
Prevalence of GJB2 gene mutation in 330 cochlear implant patients in the Jiangsu province. || Adolescent Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool China Cochlear Implantation Connexins Deafness Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Prevalence || GJB2 gene mutations are highly prevalent in pre-lingual hearing loss patients from China. Pre-lingual deafness is a sensorineural disorder that can only be treated with cochlear implantation. The prevalence of GJB2 gene mutations was examined in 330 randomly selected patients treated with cochlear implantation. Overall, 276 patients (83.64 per cent) carried variations in the GJB2 gene. Seventeen different genotypes were identified, including 10 confirmed pathogenic mutations (c.235delC, c.299delAT, c.176del16, p.E47X, p.T123N, p.V167M, p.C218Y, p.T86R, p.V63L and p.R184Q), 3 polymorphisms (p.V27I, p.E114 G and p.I203 T) and 2 unidentified mutations (p.V37I and c.571 T > C). A total of 103 patients (31.2 per cent) carried 2 confirmed pathogenic mutations. The frequency of c.235delC was higher than that reported previously in the Jiangsu province. The two novel mutations identified, 69C > G and 501G > A, are likely to be polymorphisms.	4
Unraveling regulatory programs for NF-kappaB, p53 and microRNAs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. || Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans MicroRNAs NF-kappa B Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), mutations of p53 usually coexist with aberrant activation of NF-kappaB (NF-κB), other transcription factors and microRNAs, which promote tumor pathogenesis. However, how these factors and microRNAs interact to globally modulate gene expression and mediate oncogenesis is not fully understood. We devised a novel bioinformatics method to uncover interactive relationships between transcription factors or microRNAs and genes. This approach is based on matrix decomposition modeling under the joint constraints of sparseness and regulator-target connectivity, and able to integrate gene expression profiling and binding data of regulators. We employed this method to infer the gene regulatory networks in HNSCC. We found that the majority of the predicted p53 targets overlapped with those for NF-κB, suggesting that the two transcription factors exert a concerted modulation on regulatory programs in tumor cells. We further investigated the interrelationships of p53 and NF-κB with five additional transcription factors, AP1, CEBPB, EGR1, SP1 and STAT3, and microRNAs mir21 and mir34ac. The resulting gene networks indicate that interactions among NF-κB, p53, and the two miRNAs likely regulate progression of HNSCC. We experimentally validated our findings by determining expression of the predicted NF-κB and p53 target genes by siRNA knock down, and by examining p53 binding activity on promoters of predicted target genes in the tumor cell lines. Our results elucidating the cross-regulations among NF-κB, p53, and microRNAs provide insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying HNSCC, and shows an efficient approach to inferring gene regulatory programs in biological complex systems.	0
Phenylketonuria missense mutations in the Mediterranean. || Base Sequence Cells, Cultured Cloning, Molecular Exons Female Genes Genetics, Population Humans Italy Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Transfection || Two missense mutations have been identified in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genes of an Italian phenylketonuria (PKU) patient. Both mutations occurred in exon 7 of the PAH gene, resulting in the substitution of Trp for Arg at amino acid 252 (R252W) and of Leu for Pro (P281L) at amino acid 281 of the protein. Expression vectors containing either the normal human PAH cDNA or mutant cDNAs were constructed and transfected into cultured mammalian cells. Extracts from cells transfected with either mutant construct showed negligible enzyme activity and undetectable levels of immunoreactive PAH protein as compared to the normal construct. These results are compatible with the severe classical PKU phenotype observed in this patient. Population genetic studies in the Italian population revealed that both the R252W and the P281L mutations are in linkage disequilibrium with mutant restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotype 1, which is the most prevalent RFLP haplotype in this population. The R252W mutation is present in 10% and the P281L mutation is present in 20% of haplotype 1 mutant chromosomes. These mutations are both very rare among other European populations, suggesting a Mediterranean origin for these mutant chromosomes.	3
Missense mutations associated with RFLP haplotypes 1 and 4 of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. || Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool DNA Exons Female Haplotypes Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Nucleic Acid Hybridization Pedigree Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || We report missense mutations associated with haplotype 1 and haplotype 4 alleles of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Individual exon-containing regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of a PKU patient who was a haplotype 1/4 compound heterozygote. The amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into M13 for sequence analysis. Missense mutations were observed in exons 5 and 7, resulting in the substitution of Arg by Gln at residues 158 and 261 of the enzyme, respectively. Expression analysis in heterozygous mammalian cells after site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the Arg158-to-Gln158 mutation is a PKU mutation, whereas the Arg261-to-Gln261 mutation is apparently silent in the assay system. Hybridization analysis using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes demonstrated that the Arg158-to-Gln158 mutation is present in two of six mutant haplotype 4 alleles among the Swiss and constitutes about 40% of all mutant haplotype 4 alleles in the European population. The mutation is not present in normal alleles or in any mutant alleles of other haplotypes. The results provide conclusive evidence that there is linkage disequilibrium between mutation and haplotype in the PAH gene and that multiple mutations have occurred in the PAH gene of a prevalent haplotype among Caucasians.	3
[Mutation analysis of Cx26 gene in Chinese hereditary nonsyndromic deafness sufferers]. ||  || To analyze the mutations in the code region of Cx26 gene in Chinese hereditary nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) sufferers. Thirty-three cases (29 cases in the families of 8 students who were picked out from the Deafness and Muteness School of Tianjin, 2 cases as control and 2 normal cases of genetic counseling) were included in this study. The blood samples were obtained to distill the DNA templates. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the code region of Cx26 gene was amplified. The mutations were screened by restriction endonucleases fingerprinting-single strand conformation polymorphism (REF-SSCP). Afterwards we inspected the polymorphous changes or mutations of these segments with DNA sequence. There were 30 cases with the nucleotide changes in the Cx26 code region. The rate was 90.9% (30/33). Eight kinds of mutations were found, 79G-->A, 109G-->A, 161A-->T, 235delC, 240G-->A, 341A-->G, 571T-->C and 608T-->C. 161A-->T, 240G-->A and 571T-->C were detected primarily. There were 3 cases with 235delC in 22 deafness sufferers and the rate was 13.64% (3/22). The 235delC of Cx26 gene is the main mutation in Chinese NSHI sufferers, and in NSHI cases many polymorphous changes exist.	4
Clinicopathological features and molecular analysis of primary glioblastomas in Moroccan patients. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Brain Neoplasms Child Female Genes, p53 Glioblastoma Humans Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Kaplan-Meier Estimate Karnofsky Performance Status Male Middle Aged Morocco Mutation Radiotherapy, Adjuvant || Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most aggressive primary brain tumor. Primary and secondary glioblastomas develop through different genetic pathways. The aim of this study was to determinate the genetic and clinical features of primary glioblastoma in Moroccan patients. The blood and tumor samples were obtained from a group of 34 Moroccan patients affected with primary glioblastoma. The tumors were investigated for TP53, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations using PCR sequencing analysis. Clinicopathological data showed that the mean age at diagnosis of patients was 50.06 years, the sex ratio was 11 F/23 M, and the median of Karnofsky performance score was 60. About 18 % of patients were initially treated by total tumor resection, 41 % by subtotal, and 38 % by partial resection, but biopsy was performed for a single patient (3 %). Twenty-five patients (74 %) received radiotherapy. In addition, the median survival of the all patients was 13 months following diagnosis. There was a significant impact of higher Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (≥80) on overall survival, p-log-rank test = 0.0002, whereas other parameters did not show any significant differences. The molecular analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 3/34 (8.82 %) cases; R273H, R306X, and Q136X. However, none of the analyzed samples contained the R132-IDH1 or R172-IDH2 mutations. These results showed the absence of IDH1 mutation in primary glioblastoma, confirming that this mutation is a hallmark of secondary glioblastoma. It can be used to distinguish primary from secondary glioblastomas. We found also that higher KPS was a significantly favorable factor in patients with primary glioblastoma.	4
Induction of immunoglobulin transcription factor 2 and resistance to MEK inhibitor in melanoma cells. || Benzimidazoles Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HL-60 Cells Humans K562 Cells Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Protein Kinase Inhibitors RNA Interference Transcription Factor 4 Wnt Signaling Pathway || Primary or acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors has been a barrier to successful treatment with MEK inhibitors in many tumors. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiling data from 6 sensitive and 6 resistant cell lines to identify candidate genes whose expression changes are associated with responses to a MEK inhibitor, selumetinib (AZD6244). Of 62 identified differentially expressed genes, we selected Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor 2, also known as transcription factor 4 as a potential drug resistance marker for further analysis. This was because the ITF-2 expression increase in resistant cell lines was relatively high and a previous study has suggested that ITF-2 functions as an oncogene in human colon cancers. We also established an AZD6244 resistant cell line (M14/AZD-3) from an AZD6244 sensitive M14 cell line. The expression of the ITF-2 was elevated both in primary AZD6244 resistant cell line, LOX-IMVI and acquired resistant cell line, M14/AZD-3. Targeted silencing of ITF-2 by siRNA significantly enhanced susceptibility to AZD6244 in resistant cells. Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated through direct interaction of p-ERK and GSK3β. Our results suggest that up-regulation of the ITF-2 gene expression is associated with cellular resistance to MEK inhibitors, and activation of Wnt signaling pathway through interaction of p-ERK and GSK3β seems to be a mechanism for increase of ITF-2.	0
Immunological characterization of missense mutations occurring within cytotoxic T cell-defined p53 epitopes in HLA-A*0201+ squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. || CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Cell Line, Tumor Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic Cytotoxicity, Immunologic Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Epitopes Gene Expression HLA-A Antigens HLA-A2 Antigen Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans Mutation, Missense Peptides T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Previous analyses of p53 in 40 HLA-A*0201(HLA-A2)(+) squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) indicated that 6/13 p53 missense mutations that were detected, S149C, T150R, V157F, Y220C, Y220H and E271K, occurred within HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-defined p53 epitopes. Of the 6, the p53 S149C, Y220C and Y220H peptides were immunogenic. Anti-p53 mutant S149C and Y220H effector cells cross-reacted against the parental wild type sequence (wt) p53 peptides, whereas anti-p53 Y220C effector cells were specific for the mutant peptide, p53 Y220C cDNA-transfected HLA-A2(+) SaOS cells, and an HLA-A2(+) SCCHN cell line naturally expressing the mutation. These results indicate that the p53 Y220C mutation can be processed and presented for CD8(+) T cell recognition. Furthermore, using an autologous PBMC/tumor system, anti-p53 Y220C peptide-effector cells recognizing the autologous tumor could also be generated. Our analysis of p53 in 10 additional HLA-A2(+) SCCHN tumors detected the p53 Y220C in 2/10 tumors raising the overall frequency of the p53 Y220C mutation to 6/50 (12%) HLA-A2(+) SCCHN tumors. In contrast, independent of their HLA class I genotypes, the p53 Y220C mutation frequency for all human tumors analyzed to date is approximately 1.5%. This unexpectedly high frequency of the p53 Y220C mutation in HLA-A2(+) SCCHN suggests that vaccines targeting this mutation would not only be expected to induce robust anti-tumor immune responses in HLA-A2(+) subjects, but also be more widely applicable than previously envisioned for any given p53 missense mutation.	0
Phosphorylation of Def Regulates Nucleolar p53 Turnover and Cell Cycle Progression through Def Recruitment of Calpain3. ||  || Digestive organ expansion factor (Def) is a nucleolar protein that plays dual functions: it serves as a component of the ribosomal small subunit processome for the biogenesis of ribosomes and also mediates p53 degradation through the cysteine proteinase calpain-3 (CAPN3). However, nothing is known about the exact relationship between Def and CAPN3 or the regulation of the Def function. In this report, we show that CAPN3 degrades p53 and its mutant proteins p53A138V, p53M237I, p53R248W, and p53R273P but not the p53R175H mutant protein. Importantly, we show that Def directly interacts with CAPN3 in the nucleoli and determines the nucleolar localisation of CAPN3, which is a prerequisite for the degradation of p53 in the nucleolus. Furthermore, we find that Def is modified by phosphorylation at five serine residues: S50, S58, S62, S87, and S92. We further show that simultaneous phosphorylations at S87 and S92 facilitate the nucleolar localisation of Capn3 that is not only essential for the degradation of p53 but is also important for regulating cell cycle progression. Hence, we propose that the Def-CAPN3 pathway serves as a nucleolar checkpoint for cell proliferation by selective inactivation of cell cycle-related substrates during organogenesis.	0
Characterization of a Ras mutant with identical GDP- and GTP-bound structures . || Animals COS Cells Catalysis Cercopithecus aethiops Crystallography, X-Ray Guanosine Diphosphate Guanosine Triphosphate Kinetics Lysine Mutant Proteins Mutation Protein Conformation Substrate Specificity Thermodynamics ras Proteins || We previously characterized the G60A mutant of Ras and showed that the switch regions of the GTP-bound but not the GDP-bound form of this mutant adopt an "open conformation" similar to that seen in nucleotide-free Ras. Here, we mutate Lys147 of the conserved (145)SAK(147) motif in the G60A background and characterize the resulting double mutant (DM). We show that RasDM is the first structure of a Ras protein with identical GDP- and GTP-bound structures. Both structures adopt the open conformation of the active form of RasG60A. The increase in the accessible surface area of the nucleotide is consistent with a 4-fold increase in its dissociation rate. Stopped-flow experiments show no major difference in the two-step kinetics of association of GDP or GTP with the wild type, G60A, or RasDM. Addition of Sos fails to accelerate nucleotide exchange. Overexpression of the G60A or double mutant of Ras in COS-1 cells fails to activate Erk and shows a strong dominant negative effect. Our data suggest that flexibility at position 60 is required for proper Sos-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and that structural information is somehow shared among the switch regions and the different nucleotide binding motifs.	0
Fabry disease in the Spanish population: observational study with detection of 77 patients. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Fabry Disease Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Spain Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease is a multisystemic lysosomal storage disorder caused by the impairment of α-galactosidase A. The incidence of this rare disease is underestimated due to delayed diagnosis. Moreover, the management of the identified subjects is often complicated by the detection of variants of unclear diagnostic interpretation, usually identified in screening studies. We performed an observational study based on biochemical and genetic analysis of 805 dried blood spot samples from patients with clinical symptoms or family history of this pathology, which were collected from 109 Spanish hospitals, all over the country. We identified 77 new diagnosed patients with mutations related to classical Fabry disease, as well as 2 subjects with c.374A > T; p.His125Leu, a possible new mutation that need to be confirmed. Additionally, we detected 8 subjects carrying genetic variants possibly linked to late onset Fabry disease (p.Arg118Cys and p.Ala143Thr), 4 cases with polymorphism p.Asp313Tyr and 36 individuals with single nucleotide polymorphisms in intronic regions of GLA. Five of the identified mutations (c.431delG; c.1182delA; c.374A > T; c.932 T > C; c.125 T > A; c.778G > A), which were associated with a classical phenotype have not been previously described. Moreover 3 subjects presenting complex haplotypes made up by the association of intronic variants presented impaired levels of GLA transcripts and Gb3 deposits in skin biopsy. Enzymatic screening for Fabry Disease in risk population (2 or more clinical manifestations or family history of the disease) helped to identify undiagnosed patients and unravel the impairment of GLA expression in some subjects with complex haplotypes.	4
Histone modifications affect differential regulation of TGFβ- induced NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) by wild-type and mutant p53. || Base Sequence Binding Sites Cell Line, Tumor Conserved Sequence Gene Expression Regulation Histone Acetyltransferases Histone Deacetylases Histones Humans Models, Biological Mutation NADPH Oxidase 4 Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Response Elements Sequence Deletion Smad3 Protein Transcriptional Activation Transforming Growth Factor beta Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Previously, we showed wild-type (WT) and mutant (mut) p53 differentially regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4): p53-WT suppresses TGFβ-induced NOX4, ROS and cell migration, whereas tumor-associated mut-p53 proteins enhance NOX4 expression and cell migration. Here, we extended our findings on the effects of p53 on NOX4 in several tumors and examined the basis of NOX4 transcriptional regulation by p53 and SMAD3. Statistical analysis of expression data from primary tumors available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) detected correlations between mut-p53 and increased NOX4 expression. Furthermore, by altering p53 levels in cell culture models we showed several common tumor-associated mutant forms support TGFβ/SMAD3-dependent NOX4 expression. Deletion analysis revealed two critical SMAD3 binding elements (SBE) required for mut-p53-dependent NOX4 induction, whereas p53-WT caused dose-dependent suppression of NOX4 transcription. ChIP analysis revealed SMAD3 and p53-WT or mut-p53 associate with SBEs and p53 response elements in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Interestingly, the repressive effects of p53-WT on NOX4 were relieved by mutation of its transactivation domain or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor treatment. Overexpression of p300, a transcriptional co-regulator and histone acetyltransferase (HAT), enhanced p53-mediated NOX4 induction, whereas HAT-inactive p300 reduced NOX4 expression. Mut-p53 augmented TGFβ-stimulated histone acetylation within the NOX4 promoter. Finally, wound assays demonstrated NOX4 and p300 promote TGFβ/mut-p53-mediated cell migration. Our studies provide new insight into TGFβ/SMAD3 and mut-p53-mediated NOX4 induction involving epigenetic control of NOX4 in tumor cell migration, suggesting NOX4 is a potential therapeutic target to combat tumor progression and metastasis.	0
Genomic markers of ovarian adenocarcinoma and its relevancy to the effectiveness of chemotherapy. ||  || Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the seventh highest cause of cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide. It is the second highest cause of mortality among female reproductive malignancies. The current standard first-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer includes a combination of surgical debulking and standard systemic platinum-based chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Although a deeper understanding of this disease has been attained, relapse occurs in 70% of patients 18 months subsequent to the first-line treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a novel drug that effectively affects ovarian cancer, particularly tumors that are resistant to current chemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to identify genes whose expression may be used to predict survival time or prognosis in ovarian cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Gene or protein expression is an important issue in chemoresistance and survival prediction in ovarian cancer. In the present study, the research group consisted of patients treated at the Surgical Clinic of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Gynecological Clinical Hospital, Poznan University of Medical Sciences (Poznan, Poland) between May 2006 and November 2014. Additional eligibility criteria were a similar severity (International Federation of Gynecolgy and Obstetrics stage III) at the time of diagnosis, treatment undertaken in accordance with the same schedule, and an extremely good response to treatment or a lack of response to treatment. The performance of the OncoScan® assay was evaluated by running the assay on samples obtained from the four patients and by following the recommended protocol outlined in the OncoScan assay manual. The genomic screening using Affymetrix OncoScan Arrays resulted in the identification of large genomic rearrangements across all cancer tissues. In general, chromosome number changes were detected in all examined tissues. The OncoScan arrays enabled the identification of ~100 common somatic mutations. Chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer is extremely complex and challenging to study. The present study identified specific genetic alterations associated with ovarian cancer, but not with response for treatment.	4
RASSF1A inactivation unleashes a tumor suppressor/oncogene cascade with context-dependent consequences on cell cycle progression. || Base Sequence Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Enzyme Activation Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Male MicroRNAs Molecular Sequence Data Oncogenes Repressor Proteins S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The RASSF1A gene is one of the most frequently inactivated genes in over 30 different types of cancers (H. Donninger, M. D. Vos, and G. J. Clark, J. Cell Sci. 120:3163-3172, 2007, http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jcs.010389). Despite the prevalence of RASSF1A silencing in human cancer, the mechanism by which RASSF1A functions as a tumor suppressor is not well understood. Characterization of the consequences of RASSF1A loss on epithelial cell proliferation revealed that RASSF1A expression suppresses both microRNA 21 (miR-21) expression and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation. The mechanism of the former is through restraint of SCF(βTrCP)-dependent destruction of the repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) tumor suppressor and consequent inhibition of miR-21 promoter activation. The mechanism of the latter is through physical sequestration of MST2, which results in accumulation of inactivating S259 phosphorylation of RAF1. Whether or not inactivation of these RASSF1A regulatory relationships can unleash enhanced proliferative capacity is dependent upon the coupling of SCF(βTrCP) and miR-21 to suppression of SKP2 protein translation and stability. Airway epithelial cultures retain this coupling and therefore respond to RASSF1A inactivation by p27-dependent cell cycle arrest. In contrast, colonic crypt-derived epithelial cells have uncoupled SCF(βTrCP) from SKP2 and respond to RASSF1A inactivation by enhanced proliferation rates. These observations help account for context-specific molecular etiology of oncogenic transformation and suggest intervention strategies for recently developed SKP2 inhibitors.	0
N-ras mutation detection by pyrosequencing in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia at a single institution. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Bone Marrow Codon Cytogenetic Analysis Female Hemoglobins Humans Incidence Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Male Middle Aged Mutation Sequence Analysis, DNA fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 ras Proteins || N-ras mutations are one of the most commonly detected abnormalities of myeloid origin. N-ras mutations result in a constitutively active N-ras protein that induces uncontrolled cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. We analyzed N-ras mutations in adult patients with AML at a particular institution and compared pyrosequencing analysis with a direct sequencing method for the detection of N-ras mutations. We analyzed 90 bone marrow samples from 83 AML patients. We detected N-ras mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 using the pyrosequencing method and subsequently confirmed all data by direct sequencing. Using these methods, we screened the N-ras mutation quantitatively and determined the incidence and characteristic of N-ras mutation. The incidence of N-ras mutation was 7.2% in adult AML patients. The patients with N-ras mutations showed significant higher hemoglobin levels (P=0.022) and an increased incidence of FLT3 mutations (P=0.003). We observed 3 cases with N-ras mutations in codon 12 (3.6%), 2 cases in codon 13 (2.4%), and 1 case in codon 61 (1.2%). All the mutations disappeared during chemotherapy. There is a low incidence (7.2%) of N-ras mutations in AML patients compared with other populations. Similar data is obtained by both pyrosequencing and direct sequencing. This study showed the correlation between the N-ras mutation and the therapeutic response. However, pyrosequencing provides quantitative data and is useful for monitoring therapeutic responses.	4
Mutations of p53 decrease sensitivity to the anthracycline treatments in bladder cancer cells. ||  || Due to doxorubicin (Dox) cardiotoxicity, the next generation of novel non-cardiotoxic anthracyclines, including AD 312 and AD 198, were synthesized and validated. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and mechanisms of anthracyclines-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell viability in human bladder cancer cells expressing wild-type (wt) p53 (RT4 and SW780) and mutated (mt) p53 (UM-UC-3, 5637, T-24, J82, and TCCSUP) protein. Anthracyclines inhibited cell viability in tested TCC cells, but were less effective in mt-p53 TCC cells, especially in the drug-resistant J82 and TCCSUP cells. Anthracyclines upregulated the expression of wt p53 protein in RT4 and SW780 cells, but had no effect on expression of mt p53 protein in UM-UC-3, 5637, T-24, J82, and TCCSUP cells. The anthracyclines activated caspase 3/7 and cleavage of PARP in wt-p53 RT4 and SW780 cells, and mt-p53 5637, UM-UC-3, and T-24, but not in mt-p53 J82 and TCCSUP cells. The anthracyclines-induced cleavage of PARP was blocked by p53 siRNA in wt-p53 RT4 cells. Co-treatment of AD 198 with PRIMA-1 significantly inhibited cell viability of mt-p53 J82 cells, but had no effect in wt-p53 RT4 cells. AD 198 blocked c-myc expression in mt-p53 UM-UC-3, 5637, T-24, and J82 cells, however no expression of c-myc was detected in wt-p53 RT4 and SW780 cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the anthracycline-induced resistance in bladder cancer cells positively correlated with TP53 mutations in the tetramerization domain in J82 and TCCSUP cells. Further, AD 312 and AD 198 are promising chemotherapeutic drugs for bladder cancer, especially in combination with PRIMA-1.	0

Several cytogenetic abnormalities or de novo mutations able to cause autism have recently been uncovered. In this study, the literature was reviewed to highlight genotype-phenotype correlations between causal gene mutations or cytogenetic abnormalities and behavioural or morphological phenotypes. Based on this information, a set of practical guidelines is proposed to help clinical geneticists pursue targeted genetic testing for patients with autism whose clinical phenotype is suggestive of a specific genetic or genomic aetiology.	4
hMRAPα, but Not hMRAP2, Enhances hMC4R Constitutive Activity in HEK293 Cells and This Is Not Dependent on hMRAPα Induced Changes in hMC4R Complex N-linked Glycosylation. || Adenylyl Cyclases Alternative Splicing Carrier Proteins Glycosylation HEK293 Cells Humans Membrane Proteins Protein Conformation Protein Isoforms Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 || MRAP1 but not MRAP2, is essential for melanocortin receptor 2 functional expression. Human MRAP1 splice variant (hMRAPα) and human MRAP2 (hMRAP2) also interact with the other melanocortin receptor subtypes in vitro, although the physiological significance of these interactions is unknown. Previously we showed that HA-hMC4R co-expression with hMRAPα, but not hMRAP2, specifically alters HA-hMC4R complex N-linked glycosylation. hMRAPα-FLAG also enhances hMC4R constitutive activity in vitro. Here we directly compare hMRAPα and hMRAP2 effects on hMC4R constitutive activity in HEK293 cells. In contrast to hMRAPα, co-expression with hMRAP2 had no effect on HA-hMC4R or untagged hMC4R constitutive coupling to adenylyl cyclase. We used fixed and live cell imaging of HA-hMC4R and hMC4R-eGFP respectively, to further characterise effects of hMRAPα on hMC4R subcellular trafficking. hMRAPα-FLAG co-expression did not alter the partitioning of either HA-hMC4R or hMC4R-eGFP into either the ER or the Golgi apparatus, therefore the hMRAPα effect on hMC4R complex N-linked glycosylation is probably not due to hMC4R retention in the ER. We also observed that unlike HA-hMC4R, hMC4R-eGFP lacks complex glycosylation both in the presence and absence of hMRAPα, although both HA-hMC4R and hMC4R-eGFP exhibited increased constitutive coupling to adenylyl cyclase following co-expression with hMRAPα. We conclude that hMRAPα and not hMRAP2 modulates hMC4R constitutive activity. Furthermore, hMRAPα does not increase hMC4R constitutive activity by altering hMC4R complex N-linked glycosylation. Instead we hypothesise that hMRAPα alters hMC4R conformational states leading to increased hMC4R constitutive activity.	0
The complete European guidelines on phenylketonuria: diagnosis and treatment. || Europe Humans Phenylketonurias Practice Guidelines as Topic || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism caused by deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. If left untreated, PKU results in increased phenylalanine concentrations in blood and brain, which cause severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. PKU management differs widely across Europe and therefore these guidelines have been developed aiming to optimize and standardize PKU care. Professionals from 10 different European countries developed the guidelines according to the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) method. Literature search, critical appraisal and evidence grading were conducted according to the SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) method. The Delphi-method was used when there was no or little evidence available. External consultants reviewed the guidelines. Using these methods 70 statements were formulated based on the highest quality evidence available. The level of evidence of most recommendations is C or D. Although study designs and patient numbers are sub-optimal, many statements are convincing, important and relevant. In addition, knowledge gaps are identified which require further research in order to direct better care for the future.	1 3
Probing the functional impact of sequence variation on p53-DNA interactions using a novel microsphere assay for protein-DNA binding with human cell extracts. || Base Sequence Binding Sites Cell Nucleus DNA Fluorescent Dyes Gene Regulatory Networks Genes, p53 Genetic Techniques Humans In Vitro Techniques Microspheres Models, Genetic Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Binding Recombinant Proteins Sensitivity and Specificity Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 tumor suppressor regulates its target genes through sequence-specific binding to DNA response elements (REs). Although numerous p53 REs are established, the thousands more identified by bioinformatics are not easily subjected to comparative functional evaluation. To examine the relationship between RE sequence variation -- including polymorphisms -- and p53 binding, we have developed a multiplex format microsphere assay of protein-DNA binding (MAPD) for p53 in nuclear extracts. Using MAPD we measured sequence-specific p53 binding of doxorubicin-activated or transiently expressed p53 to REs from established p53 target genes and p53 consensus REs. To assess the sensitivity and scalability of the assay, we tested 16 variants of the p21 target sequence and a 62-multiplex set of single nucleotide (nt) variants of the p53 consensus sequence and found many changes in p53 binding that are not captured by current computational binding models. A group of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was examined and binding profiles closely matched transactivation capability tested in luciferase constructs. The in vitro binding characteristics of p53 in nuclear extracts recapitulated the cellular in vivo transactivation capabilities for eight well-established human REs measured by luciferase assay. Using a set of 26 bona fide REs, we observed distinct binding patterns characteristic of transiently expressed wild type and mutant p53s. This microsphere assay system utilizes biologically meaningful cell extracts in a multiplexed, quantitative, in vitro format that provides a powerful experimental tool for elucidating the functional impact of sequence polymorphism and protein variation on protein/DNA binding in transcriptional networks.	0
Analysis of TP53 polymorphisms in North Indian sporadic esophageal cancer patients. ||  || To investigate the relationship of five TP53 polymorphisms (p.P47S, p.R72P, PIN3 ins16bp, p.R213R and r.13494g>a) with the esophageal cancer (EC) risk in North Indians. Genotyping of p.P47S, p.R72P, PIN3 ins16bp, p.R213R and r.13494g>a polymorphisms of TP53 in 136 sporadic EC patients and 136 controls using polymerase chain reaction and PCR-RFLP. The frequencies of genotype RR, RP and PP of p.R72P polymorphism were 16.91 vs 26.47%, 58.82 vs 49.27% and 24.27 vs 24.27% among patients and controls respectively. We observed significantly increased frequency of RP genotype in cases as compared to controls (OR=1.87, 95% CI, 1.01-3.46, p=0.05). The frequencies of genotype A1A1, A1A2 and A2A2 of PIN3 ins16bp polymorphism were 69.12 vs 70.59%, 27.20 vs 25% and 3.68 vs 4.41% among patients and controls. There was no significant difference among genotype and allele distribution between patients and controls. The frequencies of genotype GG, GA and AA of r.13494g>a polymorphism were 62.50 vs 64.70%, 34.56 vs 30.15% and 2.94 vs 5.15% among patients and controls respectively. No significant difference between genotype and allele frequency was observed in the patients and controls. For p.P47S and p.R213R polymorphisms, all the cases and controls had homozygous wild type genotype. The RP-A1A1-GG genotype combination shows significant risk for EC (OR=2.01, 95%CI: 1.01-3.99, p=0.05). Among the five TP53 polymorphisms investigated, only p.R72P polymorphism may contributes to EC susceptibility.	4
Molecular analysis of PIK3CA, BRAF, and RAS oncogenes in periampullary and ampullary adenomas and carcinomas. || Adenoma Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Ampulla of Vater Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Common Bile Duct Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Polymerase Chain Reaction Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || Mutations of KRAS are known to occur in periampullary and ampullary adenomas and carcinomas. However, nothing is known about NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in these tumors. While oncogenic BRAF contributes to the tumorigenesis of both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms/carcinomas (IPMN/IPMC), PIK3CA mutations were only detected in IPMN/IPMC. This study aimed to elucidate possible roles of BRAF and PIK3CA in the development of ampullary and periampullary adenomas and carcinomas. Mutations of BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, and PIK3CA were evaluated in seven adenomas, seven adenomas with carcinoma in situ, and 21 adenocarcinomas of the periampullary duodenal region and the ampulla of Vater. Exons 1 of KRAS; 2 and 3 of NRAS and HRAS; 5, 11, and 15 of BRAF; and 9 and 20 of PIK3CA were examined by direct genomic sequencing. In total, we identified ten (28.6%) KRAS mutations in exon 1 (nine in codon 12 and one in codon 13), two missense mutations of BRAF (6%), one within exon 11 (G469A), and one V600E hot spot mutation in exon 15 of BRAF. BRAF mutations were present in two of five periampullary tumors. All mutations appear to be somatic since the same alterations were not detected in the corresponding normal tissues. Our data provide evidence that oncogenic properties of KRAS and BRAF but not NRAS, HRAS, and PIK3CA contribute to the tumorigenesis of periampullary and ampullary tumors; BRAF mutations occur more frequently in periampullary than ampullary neoplasms.	4
Additional value of screening for minor genes and copy number variants in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Base Sequence Calcium-Binding Proteins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Cohort Studies Connectin DNA Copy Number Variations Female Genetic Testing Heterozygote High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Sarcomeres || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most prevalent inherited heart disease. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is the preferred genetic test, but the diagnostic value of screening for minor and candidate genes, and the role of copy number variants (CNVs) deserves further evaluation. Three hundred and eighty-seven consecutive unrelated patients with HCM were screened for genetic variants in the 5 most frequent genes (MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3 and TPM1) using Sanger sequencing (N = 84) or NGS (N = 303). In the NGS cohort we analyzed 20 additional minor or candidate genes, and applied a proprietary bioinformatics algorithm for detecting CNVs. Additionally, the rate and classification of TTN variants in HCM were compared with 427 patients without structural heart disease. The percentage of patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in the main genes was 33.3%, without significant differences between the Sanger sequencing and NGS cohorts. The screening for 20 additional genes revealed LP variants in ACTC1, MYL2, MYL3, TNNC1, GLA and PRKAG2 in 12 patients. This approach resulted in more inconclusive tests (36.0% vs. 9.6%, p<0.001), mostly due to variants of unknown significance (VUS) in TTN. The detection rate of rare variants in TTN was not significantly different to that found in the group of patients without structural heart disease. In the NGS cohort, 4 patients (1.3%) had pathogenic CNVs: 2 deletions in MYBPC3 and 2 deletions involving the complete coding region of PLN. A small percentage of HCM cases without point mutations in the 5 main genes are explained by P/LP variants in minor or candidate genes and CNVs. Screening for variants in TTN in HCM patients drastically increases the number of inconclusive tests, and shows a rate of VUS that is similar to patients without structural heart disease, suggesting that this gene should not be analyzed for clinical purposes in HCM.	4
Muscle fiber-type distribution, fiber-type-specific damage, and the Pompe disease phenotype. ||  || Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase deficiency and characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has ameliorated patients' perspectives, but reversal of skeletal muscle pathology remains a challenge. We studied pretreatment biopsies of 22 patients with different phenotypes to investigate to what extent fiber-type distribution and fiber-type-specific damage contribute to clinical diversity. Pompe patients have the same fiber-type distribution as healthy persons, but among nonclassic patients with the same GAA mutation (c.-32-13T>G), those with early onset of symptoms tend to have more type 2 muscle fibers than those with late-onset disease. Further, it seemed that the older, more severely affected classic infantile patients and the wheelchair-bound and ventilated nonclassic patients had a greater proportion of type 2x muscle fibers. However, as in other diseases, this may be caused by physical inactivity of those patients.	1
Comprehensive mutation analysis in colorectal flat adenomas. || Adenoma Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cell Cycle Proteins Colorectal Neoplasms Computational Biology DNA Mutational Analysis F-Box Proteins F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7 Female Genotyping Techniques Humans Male Microsatellite Instability Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases beta Catenin ras Proteins || Flat adenomas are a subgroup of colorectal adenomas that have been associated with a distinct biology and a more aggressive clinical behavior compared to their polypoid counterparts. In the present study, we aimed to compare the mutation spectrum of 14 cancer genes, between these two phenotypes. A consecutive series of 106 flat and 93 polypoid adenomas was analyzed retrospectively for frequently occurring mutations in "hot spot" regions of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and NRAS, as well as selected mutations in CTNNB1 (β-catenin), EGFR, FBXW7 (CDC4), PTEN, STK11, MAP2K4, SMAD4, PIK3R1 and PDGFRA using a high-throughput genotyping technique. Additionally, APC was analyzed using direct sequencing. APC mutations were more frequent in polypoid adenomas compared to flat adenomas (48.5% versus 30.3%, respectively, p = 0.02). Mutations in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, FBXW7 and CTNNB1 showed similar frequencies in both phenotypes. Between the different subtypes of flat adenomas (0-IIa, LST-F and LST-G) no differences were observed for any of the investigated genes. The lower APC mutation rate in flat adenomas compared to polypoid adenomas suggests that disruption of the Wnt-pathway may occur via different mechanisms in these two phenotypes. Furthermore, in contrast to previous observations our results in this large well-defined sample set indicate that there is no significant association between the different morphological phenotypes and mutations in key genes of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway.	4
Multiplatform molecular profiling identifies potentially targetable biomarkers in malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast. || Adolescent Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms ErbB Receptors Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Immunohistochemistry Middle Aged Mutation Neovascularization, Pathologic Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Phyllodes Tumor Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Malignant phyllodes tumor is a rare breast malignancy with sarcomatous overgrowth and with limited effective treatment options for recurrent and metastatic cases. Recent clinical trials indicated a potential for anti-angiogenic, anti-EGFR and immunotherapeutic approaches for patients with sarcomas, which led us to investigate these and other targetable pathways in malignant phyllodes tumor of the breast. Thirty-six malignant phyllodes tumors (including 8 metastatic tumors with two cases having matched primary and metastatic tumors) were profiled using gene sequencing, gene copy number analysis, whole genome expression, and protein expression. Whole genome expression analysis demonstrated consistent over-expression of genes involved in angiogenesis including VEGFA, Angiopoietin-2, VCAM1, PDGFRA, and PTTG1. EGFR protein overexpression was observed in 26/27 (96%) of cases with amplification of the EGFR gene in 8/24 (33%) cases. Two EGFR mutations were identified including EGFRvIII and a presumed pathogenic V774M mutation, respectively. The most common pathogenic mutations included TP53 (50%) and PIK3CA (15%). Cases with matched primary and metastatic tumors harbored identical mutations in both sites (PIK3CA/KRAS and RB1 gene mutations, respectively). Tumor expression of PD-L1 immunoregulatory protein was observed in 3/22 (14%) of cases. Overexpression of molecular biomarkers of increased angiogenesis, EGFR and immune checkpoints provides novel targeted therapy options in malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast.	4
Modulation of gene expression by tumor-derived p53 mutants. || Cell Growth Processes Cell Line, Tumor Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Lung Neoplasms Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis RNA, Small Interfering Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Transcriptional Activation Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || p53 mutants with a single amino acid substitution are overexpressed in a majority of human cancers containing a p53 mutation. Overexpression of the mutant protein suggests that there is a selection pressure on the cell indicative of an active functional role for mutant p53. Indeed, H1299 cells expressing mutant p53-R175H, p53-R273H or p53-D281G grow at a faster rate compared with a control cell line. Using p53-specific small interfering RNA, we show that the growth rate of mutant p53-expressing cells decreases as mutant p53 level decreases, demonstrating that the increased cellular growth is dependent on p53 expression. Increased growth rate is not observed for H1299 cell clones expressing mutant p53-D281G (L22Q/W23S), which has been shown to be defective in transactivation in transient transcriptional assays. This shows that the increased growth rate imparted by mutant p53 in H1299 cells requires the transactivation function of mutant p53. By performing microarray hybridization analyses, we show that constitutive expression of three common p53 mutants (p53-R175H, p53-R273H, and p53-D281G) in H1299 human lung carcinoma cells evokes regulation of a common set of genes, a significant number of which are involved in cell growth regulation. Predictably, H1299 cells expressing p53-D281G (L22Q/W23S) are defective in up-regulating a number of these genes. The differences in expression profiles induced by individual p53 mutants in the cells may be representative of the p53 mutants and how they can affect gene expression resulting in the observed "gain of function" phenotypes (i.e., increased growth rate, decreased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, and so forth).	0
Thermodynamic stability of wild-type and mutant p53 core domain. || Animals Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Mutation Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Some 50% of human cancers are associated with mutations in the core domain of the tumor suppressor p53. Many mutations are thought just to destabilize the protein. To assess this and the possibility of rescue, we have set up a system to analyze the stability of the core domain and its mutants. The use of differential scanning calorimetry or spectroscopy to measure its melting temperature leads to irreversible denaturation and aggregation and so is useful as only a qualitative guide to stability. There are excellent two-state denaturation curves on the addition of urea that may be analyzed quantitatively. One Zn2+ ion remains tightly bound in the holo-form of p53 throughout the denaturation curve. The stability of wild type is 6.0 kcal (1 kcal = 4.18 kJ)/mol at 25 degrees C and 9.8 kcal/mol at 10 degrees C. The oncogenic mutants R175H, C242S, R248Q, R249S, and R273H are destabilized by 3.0, 2.9, 1.9, 1.9, and 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Under certain denaturing conditions, the wild-type domain forms an aggregate that is relatively highly fluorescent at 340 nm on excitation at 280 nm. The destabilized mutants give this fluorescence under milder denaturation conditions.	0
Quinacrine upregulates p21/p27 independent of p53 through autophagy-mediated downregulation of p62-Skp2 axis in ovarian cancer. || Antimalarials Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Autophagy Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27 Drug Repositioning Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Ovary Quinacrine RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins Sequestosome-1 Protein Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We have previously shown that the anti-malarial compound Quinacrine (QC) inhibits ovarian cancer (OC) growth by modulating autophagy. In the present study we extended these studies to identify the molecular pathways regulated by QC to promote apoptosis independent of p53 status in OC. QC exhibited strong anti-cancer properties in OC cell lines in contrast to other anti-malarial autophagy inhibiting drugs. QC treatment selectively upregulated cell cycle inhibitor p21, and downregulated F box protein Skp2 and p62/SQSTM1 expression independent of p53 status. Genetic downregulation of key autophagy protein ATG5 abolished QC-mediated effects on both cell cycle protein p21/Skp2 as well as autophagic cargo protein p62. Furthermore, genetic silencing of p62/SQSTM1 resulted in increased sensitivity to QC-mediated apoptosis, downregulated Skp2 mRNA and increased accumulation of p21 expression. Likewise, genetic knockdown of Skp2 resulted in the upregulation of p21 and p27 and increased sensitivity of OC cells to QC treatment. In contrast, transient overexpression of exogenous p62-HA plasmid rescued the QC-mediated Skp2 downregulation indicating the positive regulation of Skp2 by p62. Collectively, these data indicate that QC-mediated effects on cell cycle proteins p21/Skp2is autophagy-dependent and p53-independent in high grade serious OC cells.	0
[Analysis of mutations and VNTR-polymorphism in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene]. || Alleles Haplotypes Humans Minisatellite Repeats Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Ukraine || The data on 5 PAH gene mutations analysis are presented. The most common mutation observed in Ukrainian population was determined to be R408W (66.6%). As well two minor mutations R158Q (2.5%) and Y414C (1.25%) were identified. The allelic variation of the VNTR-polymorphism in 470 healthy volunteers and 39 PKU-patients were analysed. 7 allelic variants and 15 haplotypes were found. The linkage disequilibrium was displayed between mutation R408W and VNTR-haplotypes 03. An advantages of molecular genetic analysis of mutations and VNTR-polymorphism for diagnosis of PKU in Ukraine are discussed.	3
Multiple origins for phenylketonuria in Europe. || Europe Gene Frequency Haplotypes Humans Mutation Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among Caucasians and other ethnic groups, is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the PAH gene. The haplotype associations, relative frequencies, and distributions of five prevalent PAH mutations (R158Q, R261Q, IVS10nt546, R408W, and IVS12n1) were established in a comprehensive European sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major PKU alleles. Each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight RFLPs in or near the PAH gene. These findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago. From the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout Europe, four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups. Together, these data suggest that there were multiple, geographically and ethnically distinct origins for PKU within the European population.	3
Mutant TP53 in duodenal samples of pancreatic juice from patients with pancreatic cancer or high-grade dysplasia. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutant Proteins Pancreatic Juice Pancreatic Neoplasms Precancerous Conditions Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Imaging tests can identify patients with pancreatic neoplastic cysts but not microscopic dysplasia. We investigated whether mutant TP53 can be detected in duodenal samples of secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice, and whether this assay can be used to screen for high-grade dysplasia and invasive pancreatic cancer. We determined the prevalence of mutant TP53 in microdissected pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and invasive adenocarcinomas. TP53 mutations were quantified by digital high-resolution melt-curve analysis and sequencing of secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice samples, collected from duodena of 180 subjects enrolled in Cancer of the Pancreas Screening trials; patients were enrolled because of familial and/or inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer, or as controls. TP53 mutations were identified in 9.1% of intermediate-grade IPMNs (2 of 22), 17.8% of PanIN-2 (8 of 45), 38.1% of high-grade IPMNs (8 of 21), 47.6% of PanIN-3 (10 of 21), and 75% of invasive pancreatic adenocarcinomas (15 of 20); no TP53 mutations were found in PanIN-1 lesions or low-grade IPMNs. TP53 mutations were detected in duodenal samples of pancreatic juice from 29 of 43 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (67.4% sensitivity; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.80) and 4 of 8 patients with high-grade lesions (PanIN-3 and high-grade IPMN). No TP53 mutations were identified in samples from 58 controls or 55 screened individuals without evidence of advanced lesions. We detected mutant TP53 in secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice samples collected from duodena of patients with high-grade dysplasia or invasive pancreatic cancer. Tests for mutant TP53 might be developed to improve the diagnosis of and screening for pancreatic cancer and high-grade dysplasia. Clinical Trial numbers: NCT00438906 and NCT00714701.	4
Detection of EGFR and BRAF mutations by competitive allele-specific TaqMan polymerase chain reaction in lung adenocarcinoma. ||  || Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing sensitive EGFR-mutants. Other drugs target different driver mutants, including the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) inhibitor dabrafenib, which has exhibited promising efficacy for treating patients with metastatic BRAF-mutated NSCLC. Therefore, identifying patients carrying mutations that may be treated using targeted therapies is important. However, the methods of molecular detection presently applied in clinical practice, particularly detection of BRAF in NSCLC patients, require further investigation. Therefore, more sensitive and economic methods are required. The present study applied the competitive allele-specific TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (CastPCR) technology to the molecular detection of EGFR (del2235-2249, del2236-2250, T790M, L858R) and BRAF (V600E, G469A, D594G) mutations in 144 treatment-naive patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and analyzed the association between the mutation rates and patients' clinicopathological features. 51.4% (74/144) cases were identified harboring EGFR mutations. A total of 40.3% (58/144) patients carried sensitizing mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R) and 14.6% (21/144) carried T790M mutations. 6.9% (10/144) mutation-positive patients were double-mutated. Total EGFR mutation rate was significantly increased in female compared with that of males (60.9 vs. 43.8%, P<0.05), in non-smokers compared with that of smokers (62.8 vs. 34.5%, P<0.05). In total, 8.3% (12/144) patients were identified with BRAF mutations. 16.7% were V600E (2/12) and 83.3% (10/12) were non-V600E mutants. Among the 10 non-V600E mutations, D594G accounted for 90.0% (9/10) and G469A accounted for 10.0% (1/10). Statistical analysis demonstrated that the BRAF mutation rate was not associated with any of the following clinicopathological features: Sex, age, smoking history, clinical stages, distant metastasis, differentiation degree, tumor size and regional lymph node metastasis (P≥0.05). CastPCR technology is a robust method with high sensitivity for the molecular detection of EGFR and BRAF mutations in clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples.	4
Molecular characterization of TP53 gene in human populations exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation. || Adult Alleles Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Environmental Exposure Exons Genomic Instability Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Radiation Dosage Radiation, Ionizing Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Uranium || Ionizing radiation, such as that emitted by uranium, may cause mutations and consequently lead to neoplasia in human cells. The TP53 gene acts to maintain genomic integrity and constitutes an important biomarker of susceptibility. The present study investigated the main alterations observed in exons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the TP53 gene and adjacent introns in Amazonian populations exposed to radioactivity. Samples were collected from 163 individuals. Occurrence of the following alterations was observed: (i) a missense exchange in exon 4 (Arg72Pro); (ii) 2 synonymous exchanges, 1 in exon 5 (His179His), and another in exon 6 (Arg213Arg); (iii) 4 intronic exchanges, 3 in intron 7 (C → T at position 13.436; C → T at position 13.491; T → G at position 13.511) and 1 in intron 8 (T → G at position 13.958). Alteration of codon 72 was found to be an important risk factor for cancer development (P = 0.024; OR = 6.48; CI: 1.29-32.64) when adjusted for age and smoking. Thus, TP53 gene may be an important biomarker for carcinogenesis susceptibility in human populations exposed to ionizing radiation.	4
MYBPH acts as modifier of cardiac hypertrophy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. || Adult Cardiomegaly Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cohort Studies Cytoskeletal Proteins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Follow-Up Studies Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Prognosis || Left ventricular hypertrophy is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is considered a model disease to study causal molecular factors underlying isolated cardiac hypertrophy. However, HCM manifests with various clinical symptoms, even in families bearing the same genetic defects, suggesting that additional factors contribute to hypertrophy. The gene encoding the cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMYBPC) is one of the most frequently implicated genes in HCM. Recently another myosin binding protein, myosin binding protein H (MYBPH) was shown to function in concert with cMYBPC in regulating cardiomyocyte contraction. Given the similarity in sequence, structure and the critical role MYBPH plays in sarcomere contraction, we proposed that MYBPH may be involved in HCM pathogenesis. Family-based genetic association analysis was employed to investigate the contribution of MYBPH in modifying hypertrophy. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in MYBPH were investigated for hypertrophy modifying effects in 388 individuals (27 families), in which three unique South African HCM-causing founder mutations (p.R403W and pA797T in β-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) and p.R92W in the cardiac troponin T gene (TNNT2)) segregate. We observed a significant association between rs2250509 and hypertrophy traits in the p.A797T MYH7 mutation group. Additionally, haplotype GGTACTT significantly affected hypertrophy within the same mutation group. MYBPH was for the first time assessed as a candidate hypertrophy modifying gene. We identified a novel association between MYBPH and hypertrophy traits in HCM patients carrying the p.A797T MYH7 mutation, suggesting that variation in MYBPH can modulate the severity of hypertrophy in HCM.	4

Leveraging splice-affecting variant predictors and a minigene validation system to identify Mendelian disease-causing variants among exon-captured variants of uncertain significance. || Alleles Chromosome Mapping Computational Biology Exons Gene Expression Genes, Reporter Genetic Association Studies Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genotype High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Molecular Sequence Annotation Pedigree RNA Splicing Reproducibility of Results || The genetic heterogeneity of Mendelian disorders results in a significant proportion of patients that are unable to be assigned a confident molecular diagnosis after conventional exon sequencing and variant interpretation. Here, we evaluated how many patients with an inherited retinal disease (IRD) have variants of uncertain significance (VUS) that are disrupting splicing in a known IRD gene by means other than affecting the canonical dinucleotide splice site. Three in silico splice-affecting variant predictors were leveraged to annotate and prioritize variants for splicing functional validation. An in vitro minigene system was used to assay each variant's effect on splicing. Starting with 745 IRD patients lacking a confident molecular diagnosis, we validated 23 VUS as splicing variants that likely explain disease in 26 patients. Using our results, we optimized in silico score cutoffs to guide future variant interpretation. Variants that alter base pairs other than the canonical GT-AG dinucleotide are often not considered for their potential effect on RNA splicing but in silico tools and a minigene system can be utilized for the prioritization and validation of such splice-disrupting variants. These variants can be overlooked causes of human disease but can be identified using conventional exon sequencing with proper interpretation guidelines.	4
Effects of GJB2 genotypes on the audiological phenotype: variability is present for all genotypes. || Adolescent Adult Audiometry, Pure-Tone Auditory Threshold Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Female Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Homozygote Humans Male Mutation Phenotype Regression Analysis Turkey || Recent studies have revealed a genotype-phenotype correlation for mutations in the GJB2 gene. Since ethnic difference may have an effect for the degree of hearing loss due to background genes, we aimed to search for confirmation of previously suggested genotype-phenotype correlation in GJB2 deafness in the Turkish population. Pure tone audiograms of 63 unrelated probands with GJB2-associated hearing loss having 15 different mutations were obtained and evaluated for correlation between the degree of hearing loss and genotypes. Three GJB2 genotypes identified in more than one family were homozygous c.35delG (44 probands), homozygous p.E120del (four probands) and c.[35delG]+[IVS1+1G>A] (two probands). No statistical difference for the degree of hearing loss was observed when the genotypes were compared individually or grouped according to their effects on the protein. The most likely explanation for this result is the relatively small size of the studied population. Degree of hearing loss was variable in c.35delG and p.E120del homozygotes. Intra-familial phenotypic variability was present for some genotypes. The detailed audiological data for homozygous p.E120del and c.[35delG]+[328delG] genotypes are reported for the first time in this study. Previously reported genotype-phenotype correlations for the GJB2 deafness should be cautiously interpreted during the clinical counseling since variability in the degree of hearing loss is present for all GJB2 genotypes.	4
Mutant p53 in cancer: new functions and therapeutic opportunities. || Animals Apoptosis Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mice Mutation Neoplasms Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Many different types of cancer show a high incidence of TP53 mutations, leading to the expression of mutant p53 proteins. There is growing evidence that these mutant p53s have both lost wild-type p53 tumor suppressor activity and gained functions that help to contribute to malignant progression. Understanding the functions of mutant p53 will help in the development of new therapeutic approaches that may be useful in a broad range of cancer types.	0
[Gene mutation and clinical phenotype analysis of patients with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]. || Cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic Mutation Noonan syndrome || <b>Objective:</b> To analyze the gene mutations and clinical features of patients with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. <b>Method:</b> Determined the mutation domain in five cases diagnosed with Noonan syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and identified the relationship between the mutant domain and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by searching relevant articles in pubmed database. <b>Result:</b> Three mutant genes (PTPN11 gene in chromosome 12, RIT1 gene in chromosome 1 and RAF1 gene in chromosome 3) in five cases all had been reported to be related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The reported hypertrophic cardiomyopathy relevant genes MYPN, MYH6 and MYBP3 had also been found in case 1 and 2. Patients with same gene mutation had different clinical manifestations. Both case 4 and 5 had RAF1 mutation (c.770C>T). However, case 4 had special face, low IQ, mild pulmonary artery stenosis, and only mild ventricular hypertrophy. <b>Conclusion:</b> Noonan syndrome is a genetic heterogeneity disease. Our study identified specific gene mutations that could result in Noonan syndrome with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy through molecular biology methods. The results emphasize the importance of gene detection in the management of Noonan syndrome.	4
Genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia using a DNA-array based platform. || DNA Mutational Analysis Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Sequence Analysis, DNA || The aim of this study was to validate the Lipochip genetic diagnostic platform by assessing effectiveness, sensitivity, specificity and costs for the identification of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in Spain. This platform includes the use of a DNA micro array, the detection of large gene rearrangements and the complete resequencing of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. DNA samples of patients with clinically diagnosed FH were analyzed for mutations by application of the Lipochip platform. Results obtained were confirmed by DNA sequencing and MLPA analysis by two other, independent laboratories. Of 808 patients tested, Lipochip detected a mutation in 66% of the cases and of these 78% were detected by the micro array. A specificity of 99.5% at a sensitivity of 99.8% was reached. A positive test result could be reported within 22 days after start of analysis. The total average screening costs of $350 per case were significantly lower compared to other existing screening programs. Lipochip provides a reliable, fast and cheap alternative for the genetic testing of patients with clinically diagnosed FH.	4
Detection of low prevalence somatic mutations in solid tumors with ultra-deep targeted sequencing. || Aged Animals Automation, Laboratory Carcinoma Databases, Genetic Genes, Neoplasm High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mice Middle Aged Mutation Mutation Rate Sarcoma Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Ultra-deep targeted sequencing (UDT-Seq) can identify subclonal somatic mutations in tumor samples. Early assays' limited breadth and depth restrict their clinical utility. Here, we target 71 kb of mutational hotspots in 42 cancer genes. We present novel methods enhancing both laboratory workflow and mutation detection. We evaluate UDT-Seq true sensitivity and specificity (> 94% and > 99%, respectively) for low prevalence mutations in a mixing experiment and demonstrate its utility using six tumor samples. With an improved performance when run on the Illumina Miseq, the UDT-Seq assay is well suited for clinical applications to guide therapy and study clonal selection in heterogeneous samples.	4
Organ manifestations and long-term outcome of Fabry disease in patients with the GLA haplotype D313Y. || Adolescent Adult Biomarkers Electrocardiography, Ambulatory Exercise Test Fabry Disease Female Glycolipids Haplotypes Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Mutation Quality of Life Sphingolipids Ventricular Function, Left Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || The severity of Fabry disease is dependent on the type of mutation in the α-galactosidase A (AgalA) encoding gene (GLA). This study focused on the impact of the GLA haplotype D313Y on long-term organ involvement and function. In this monocentric study, all participants presenting with the D313Y haplotype between 2001 and 2015 were comprehensively clinically investigated at baseline and during a 4-year follow-up if available. Five females and one male were included. Cardiac, nephrological, neurological, laboratory and quality of life data. AgalA enzyme activity in leucocytes (0.3±0.9 nmol/min/mg protein (mean±SD)) and serum lyso-Gb3 (0.6±0.3 ng/mL at baseline) were in normal range in all patients. Cardiac morphology and function were normal (left-ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 66±8%; interventricular septum 7.7±1.4 mm; LV posterior wall 7.5±1.4 mm; normalised LV mass in MRI 52±9 g/m(2); LV global longitudinal strain -21.6±1.9%) and there were no signs of myocardial fibrosis in cardiac MRI. Cardiospecific biomarkers were also in normal range. Renal function was not impaired (estimated glomerular filtration rate MDRD 103±15 mL/min; serum-creatinine 0.75±0.07 mg/dL; cystatin-c 0.71±0.12 mg/L). One female patient (also carrying a Factor V Leiden mutation) had a transitory ischaemic attack. One patient showed white matter lesions in brain MRI, but none had Fabry-associated pain attacks, pain crises, evoked pain or permanent pain. Health-related quality of life analysis revealed a reduction in individual well-being. At long-term follow-up after 4 years, no significant change was seen in any parameter. The results of the current study suggest that the D313Y genotype does not lead to severe organ manifestations as seen in genotypes known to be causal for classical FD.	3

Malignant Hyperthermia in the Post-Genomics Era: New Perspectives on an Old Concept. || Anesthesia, General Genomics Humans Malignant Hyperthermia Rhabdomyolysis Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel || This article reviews advancements in the genetics of malignant hyperthermia, new technologies and approaches for its diagnosis, and the existing limitations of genetic testing for malignant hyperthermia. It also reviews the various RYR1-related disorders and phenotypes, such as myopathies, exertional rhabdomyolysis, and bleeding disorders, and examines the connection between these disorders and malignant hyperthermia.	4
Supramolecular assemblies and localized regulation of voltage-gated ion channels. || Animals Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2 Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases Humans Ion Channel Gating Ion Channels Phosphoprotein Phosphatases Protein Kinase C src-Family Kinases || This review addresses the localized regulation of voltage-gated ion channels by phosphorylation. Comprehensive data on channel regulation by associated protein kinases, phosphatases, and related regulatory proteins are mainly available for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which form the main focus of this review. Other voltage-gated ion channels and especially Kv7.1-3 (KCNQ1-3), the large- and small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels BK and SK2, and the inward-rectifying K+ channels Kir3 have also been studied to quite some extent and will be included. Regulation of the L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 by PKA has been studied most thoroughly as it underlies the cardiac fight-or-flight response. A prototypical Cav1.2 signaling complex containing the beta2 adrenergic receptor, the heterotrimeric G protein Gs, adenylyl cyclase, and PKA has been identified that supports highly localized via cAMP. The type 2 ryanodine receptor as well as AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors are in close proximity to Cav1.2 in cardiomyocytes and neurons, respectively, yet independently anchor PKA, CaMKII, and the serine/threonine phosphatases PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, as is discussed in detail. Descriptions of the structural and functional aspects of the interactions of PKA, PKC, CaMKII, Src, and various phosphatases with Cav1.2 will include comparisons with analogous interactions with other channels such as the ryanodine receptor or ionotropic glutamate receptors. Regulation of Na+ and K+ channel phosphorylation complexes will be discussed in separate papers. This review is thus intended for readers interested in ion channel regulation or in localization of kinases, phosphatases, and their upstream regulators.	0
Genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in Han Chinese. || China Ethnic Groups Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Mutation Phenotype || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder of lipoprotein metabolism resulting in elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which lead to increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease. The recognized cause is mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. This study reviewed the literature in Han Chinese to investigate the frequency and spectrum of mutations that are recognized by molecular genetics as causes of FH, the clinical characteristics, and mutation detection rates of FH. MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Wanfang, CNKI, and FH websites, were reviewed through December 2014. Sixty-six studies met inclusion criteria. Totally, 143 different LDLR mutations were identified, including 134 point mutations and 9 large rearrangements; functional characteristics of 46 point mutations were studied. The 5 most frequent mutations included APOB 10579C>T, LDLR 986G>A, 1747C>T, 1879G>A, and 268G>A. Most of these mutations were reported in Southeast China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. DNA detection rates of heterozygous FH were 6.5% to 77.5%, depending on the inclusion criteria and chosen screening method. With the economic growth and Western-like diet patterns being adopted over the past decade in municipalities in mainland China and Taiwan, the mean pretreatment concentration of LDL-C is higher among heterozygous FH patients reported since 2005 than in patients reported before 2005 (231 vs 196 mg/dL, P < .001). This review of DNA data for Han Chinese patients with FH updates the frequency and spectrum of FH scenarios. Large-scale investigations are needed to determine the interactions between mutations and LDL-C level in relation to cardiovascular risk assessment and management.	4
Type I gamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase modulates adherens junction and E-cadherin trafficking via a direct interaction with mu 1B adaptin. || Adaptor Protein Complex mu Subunits Adherens Junctions Amino Acid Sequence Animals Cadherins Cell Compartmentation Cell Line Dogs Endothelial Cells Humans Kidney Molecular Sequence Data Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor) Protein Binding Protein Transport Umbilical Veins || Assembly of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJ) is obligatory for establishment of polarized epithelia and plays a key role in repressing the invasiveness of many carcinomas. Here we show that type Igamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma) directly binds to E-cadherin and modulates E-cadherin trafficking. PIPKIgamma also interacts with the mu subunits of clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes and acts as a signalling scaffold that links AP complexes to E-cadherin. Depletion of PIPKIgamma or disruption of PIPKIgamma binding to either E-cadherin or AP complexes results in defects in E-cadherin transport and blocks AJ assembly. An E-cadherin germline mutation that loses PIPKIgamma binding and shows disrupted basolateral membrane targeting no longer forms AJs and leads to hereditary gastric cancers. These combined results reveal a novel mechanism where PIPKIgamma serves as both a scaffold, which links E-cadherin to AP complexes and the trafficking machinery, and a regulator of trafficking events via the spatial generation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.	0
Highly recurrent TERT promoter mutations in human melanoma. || Binding Sites Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Liver Neoplasms Melanoma Mutation Promoter Regions, Genetic Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets Telomerase Transcription, Genetic || Systematic sequencing of human cancer genomes has identified many recurrent mutations in the protein-coding regions of genes but rarely in gene regulatory regions. Here, we describe two independent mutations within the core promoter of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which collectively occur in 50 of 70 (71%) melanomas examined. These mutations generate de novo consensus binding motifs for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, and in reporter assays, the mutations increased transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by two- to fourfold. Examination of 150 cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 24 cases (16%), with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus, somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.	0
Deciphering KRAS and NRAS mutated clone dynamics in MLL-AF4 paediatric leukaemia by ultra deep sequencing analysis. || Female GTP Phosphohydrolases High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Leukemia Male Membrane Proteins Mutation Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || To induce and sustain the leukaemogenic process, MLL-AF4+ leukaemia seems to require very few genetic alterations in addition to the fusion gene itself. Studies of infant and paediatric patients with MLL-AF4+ B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) have reported mutations in KRAS and NRAS with incidences ranging from 25 to 50%. Whereas previous studies employed Sanger sequencing, here we used next generation amplicon deep sequencing for in depth evaluation of RAS mutations in 36 paediatric patients at diagnosis of MLL-AF4+ leukaemia. RAS mutations including those in small sub-clones were detected in 63.9% of patients. Furthermore, the mutational analysis of 17 paired samples at diagnosis and relapse revealed complex RAS clone dynamics and showed that the mutated clones present at relapse were almost all originated from clones that were already detectable at diagnosis and survived to the initial therapy. Finally, we showed that mutated patients were indeed characterized by a RAS related signature at both transcriptional and protein levels and that the targeting of the RAS pathway could be of beneficial for treatment of MLL-AF4+ BCP-ALL clones carrying somatic RAS mutations.	4
Detection of the 35delG/GJB2 and del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutations in Venezuelan patients with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. || Adolescent Alleles Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genetic Testing Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Pedigree Sequence Deletion Venezuela || Severe to profound hearing impairment affects 1 of every 1000 newborn children each year. Inheritance accounts for 60% of these cases, of which 70% are nonsyndromic. The most common cause of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is mutation in GJB2, a gene on chromosome 13, which encodes a gap junction protein named Connexin 26. Mutations in GJB2 are responsible for 40% of genetic childhood deafness. The most common mutation, 35delG, predominates in many ethnic groups. Some families with linkage to the DFNB1 locus have none or only one mutated allele in GJB2, however, some subjects can exhibit a large deletion in another connexin gene, GJB6, resulting in a monogenic or digenic pattern of inheritance in this complex DFNB1 locus that contains both genes (GJB2 and GJB6). The aim of the study was to determine (1) the frequency for the 35delG (27.5%), del(GJB6-D13S1830) (2.5%) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) (0.0%) mutations in a cohort of 40 Venezuelan patients with ARNSHL and (2) the carrier frequency 35delG (4%), del(GJB6-D13S1830) (0%) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) (0%) in the Venezuelan population with no familial history of hearing impairment. One patient (2.5%) was detected as double heterozygote for the deletion del(GJB6-D13S1830) and 35delG mutation. This result has direct clinical implications because we include the molecular detection of the deletion del(GJB6-D13S1830) during the evaluation of the diagnosis of deafness in the Venezuelan population.	4
Prevalence of GJB2 causing recessive profound non-syndromic deafness in Japanese children. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group Audiometry Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Gene Deletion Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Infant Japan Male Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Prevalence Severity of Illness Index Sex Distribution || GJB2 (gap junction protein, beta 2, 26kDa: connexin 26) is a gap junction protein gene that has been implicated in many cases of autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness. Point and deletion mutations in GJB2 are the most frequent cause of non-syndromic deafness across racial groups. To clarify the relation between profound non-syndromic deafness and GJB2 mutation in Japanese children, we performed genetic testing for GJB2. We conducted mutation screening employing PCR and direct sequencing for GJB2 in 126 children who had undergone cochlear implantation with congenital deafness. We detected 10 mutations, including two unreported mutations (p.R32S and p.P225L) in GJB2. We identified the highest-frequency mutation (c.235delC: 44.8%) and other nonsense or truncating mutations, as in previous studies. However, in our research, p.R143W, which is one of the missense mutations, may also show an important correlation with severe deafness. Our results suggest that the frequencies of mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 deletions differ among cohorts. Thus, our report is an important study of GJB2 in Japanese children with profound non-syndromic deafness.	4
PAX3 gene deletion detected by microarray analysis in a girl with hearing loss. ||  || Deletions of the PAX3 gene have been rarely reported in the literature. Mutations of this gene are a common cause of Waardenburg syndrome type 1 and 3. We report a 16 year old female presenting hearing loss and normal intellectual development, without major features of Waardenburg syndrome type 1, and without family history of the syndrome. Her phenotype, however, overlaps with features of craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome. Microarray analysis showed ~862 kb de novo deletion at 2q36.1 including PAX3. The above findings suggest that the rearrangement found in our patient appeared de novo and with high probability is a cause of her phenotype.	4
Induction of p53 dependent apoptosis upon overexpression of a nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase. || Animals Apoptosis Caspase Inhibitors Cell Nucleus Humans Isoenzymes Neoplasm Proteins Nuclear Proteins Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Recombinant Proteins Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Two ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine phosphatases, PTP-S2 and PTP-S4 (also known as TC45 and TC48, respectively), are alternately spliced products of the same gene. Overexpression of PTP-S2 by transient transfection induced chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, typical of apoptosis. Expression of PTP-S4 resulted in a much lower number of cells with apoptotic phenotype. PTP-S2 induced apoptosis in MCF7 and A549 human tumor cell lines which are p53 positive but not in HeLa and SW620 cells which are p53 negative. Apoptosis induced by PTP-S2 in MCF7 cells was inhibited by cotransfection with mutant p53 (Arg-273 --> His) but not by wild type p53. PTP-S2 induced apoptosis was inhibited by antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 and certain inhibitors of caspases. These results suggest that the nuclear tyrosine phosphatase PTP-S2 induces p53 dependent, serum starvation independent and caspase mediated apoptosis.	0
Is autosomal recessive deafness associated with oculocutaneous albinism a "coincidence syndrome"? || Adolescent Albinism, Oculocutaneous Antigens, Neoplasm Audiometry, Pure-Tone Child Child, Preschool Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Exons Female Genes, Recessive Haplotypes Heterozygote Humans Male Membrane Proteins Membrane Transport Proteins Molecular Sequence Data Pedigree Syndrome || Hearing impairment is frequently found associated with pigmentary disorders in many syndromes. However, total oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) associated with deafness has been described only once, by Ziprkowski and Adam (Arch Dermatol 89:151-155, 1964) in an inbred family. A syndrome associating deafness and OCA was suggested by the authors, but two separate recessive genes segregating in this inbred group were also proposed later by Fraser (OMIM # 220900). Combined deafness and total OCA were also observed by us in a family originally reported to be nonconsanguineous but in which haplotyping showed evidence of a common ancestry: the proband was affected by both diseases, one of his sisters had only OCA and another sister had only deafness. Both the proband and his deaf sister were found to be homozygotes for the 35delG mutation (GJB2 gene), the most frequent cause of hereditary deafness. Linkage analysis with markers close to the four known OCA loci excluded linkage to OCA1, OCA2, and OCA3, and homozygosity in markers near OCA4 locus was observed. Sequencing of the corresponding gene (MATP) revealed a c.1121delT mutation, which leads to a stop codon at position 397 (L374fsX397). Clearly, the combined occurrence of deafness and albinism in this pedigree was due to mutations in two different genes, showing autosomal recessive inheritance. We speculate that the putative syndrome reported by Ziprkowski and Adam might have resulted from the co-occurrence of autosomal recessive deafness and albinism in the same pedigree, as suggested by Fraser.	4
Expanding the prion concept to cancer biology: dominant-negative effect of aggregates of mutant p53 tumour suppressor. || Amyloid Animals Humans Mutation Neoplasms Prion Diseases Protein Binding Protein Folding Protein Multimerization Protein Structure, Quaternary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a key protein that participates in cell-cycle control, and its malfunction can lead to cancer. This tumour suppressor protein has three main domains; the N-terminal transactivation domain, the CTD (C-terminal domain) and the core domain (p53C) that constitutes the sequence-specific DBD (DNA-binding region). Most p53 mutations related to cancer development are found in the DBD. Aggregation of p53 into amyloid oligomers and fibrils has been shown. Moreover, amyloid aggregates of both the mutant and WT (wild-type) forms of p53 were detected in tumour tissues. We propose that if p53 aggregation occurred, it would be a crucial aspect of cancer development, as p53 would lose its WT functions in an aggregated state. Mutant p53 can also exert a dominant-negative regulatory effect on WT p53. Herein, we discuss the dominant-negative effect in light of p53 aggregation and the fact that amyloid-like mutant p53 can convert WT p53 into more aggregated species, leading into gain of function in addition to the loss of tumour suppressor function. In summary, the results obtained in the last decade indicate that cancer may have characteristics in common with amyloidogenic and prion diseases.	0
Molecular-Targeted Therapies for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Its Resistance Mechanisms. || Animals Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Gene Amplification Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Neoplasms Protein Kinase Inhibitors || Cancer therapies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), such as small-molecule kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been developed as standard therapies for several cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Although these therapies can significantly prolong progression-free survival, curative effects are not often achieved because of intrinsic and/or acquired resistance. The resistance mechanisms to EGFR-targeted therapies can be categorized as resistant gene mutations, activation of alternative pathways, phenotypic transformation, and resistance to apoptotic cell death. Analysis of the processes that modulate EGFR signal transduction by EGFR-targeted inhibitors, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, has revealed new therapeutic opportunities and has elucidated novel mechanisms contributing to the discovery of more effective anticancer treatments. In this review, we discuss the roles of EGFR in cancer development, therapeutic strategies for targeting EGFR, and resistance mechanisms to EGFR-targeted therapies, with a focus on cancer therapies for individual patients.	0
Genetic Gastric Cancer Susceptibility in the International Clinical Cancer Genomics Community Research Network. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomedical Research Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genomics Germ-Line Mutation Humans Internationality Male Middle Aged Sequence Analysis, DNA Signal Transduction Stomach Neoplasms Young Adult || Few susceptibility genes for gastric cancer have been identified. We sought to identify germline susceptibility genes from participants with gastric cancer from an international hereditary cancer research network. Adults with gastric cancer of any histology, and with a germline DNA sample (n = 51), were retrospectively selected. For those without previously identified germline mutations (n = 43), sequencing was performed for 706 candidate genes. Twenty pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified among 18 participants. Eight of the 18 participants had previous positive clinical testing, including six with CDH1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, and two with pathogenic MSH2 and TP53 variants. Of the remaining 10, six were in BRCA1 DNA damage response pathway genes (ATM, ATR, BRCA2, BRIP1, FANCC, TP53), other variants were identified in CTNNA1, FLCN, SBDS, and GNAS. Participants identified with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were younger at gastric cancer diagnosis than those without, 39.1 versus 48.0 years, and over 50% had a close family member with gastric cancer (p-values < 0.0001). In conclusion, many participants were identified with mutations in clinically-actionable genes. Age of onset and family history of gastric cancer were mutation status predictors. Our findings support multigene panels in identifying gastric cancer predisposition.	4
p53-mediated adaptation to serine starvation is retained by a common tumour-derived mutant. ||  || In response to oncogenic stress, the tumour suppressor protein p53 can induce the elimination of cells through induction of cell death or senescence, helping to restrain malignant progression. Conversely, under nutrient stress, p53 can protect cells by supporting metabolic adaptation. Many cancers express mutant p53 proteins that have lost the cell-elimination properties of wild-type p53. However, a previous report showed that a tumour-derived mutant can retain the ability to support cells under glutamine starvation. We show that a commonly occurring p53 mutant, R248W, retains wild-type ability to support survival under serine starvation. R248W, but not R175H, can engage p21 and MDM2, which both function to limit oxidative stress and facilitate the switch to de novo serine synthesis. In vivo, the growth of R248W-expressing tumours is resistant to dietary depletion of serine and glycine, correlating with an increased capacity to limit ROS compared to tumours expressing R175H. Human cancers expressing this p53 mutant show a worse outcome. Our work shows that mutant p53s can selectively retain wild-type p53 functions that allow adaptation to serine starvation through the activation of antioxidant defence pathways. Tumours containing this p53 mutation are resistant to serine-limited conditions and less responsive to therapy.	0
GAA Deficiency in Pompe Disease Is Alleviated by Exon Inclusion in iPSC-Derived Skeletal Muscle Cells. ||  || Pompe disease is a metabolic myopathy caused by deficiency of the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme and results in progressive wasting of skeletal muscle cells. The c.-32-13T>G (IVS1) GAA variant promotes exon 2 skipping during pre-mRNA splicing and is the most common variant for the childhood/adult disease form. We previously identified antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that promoted GAA exon 2 inclusion in patient-derived fibroblasts. It was unknown how these AONs would affect GAA splicing in skeletal muscle cells. To test this, we expanded induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived myogenic progenitors and differentiated these to multinucleated myotubes. AONs restored splicing in myotubes to a similar extent as in fibroblasts, suggesting that they act by modulating the action of shared splicing regulators. AONs targeted the putative polypyrimidine tract of a cryptic splice acceptor site that was part of a pseudo exon in GAA intron 1. Blocking of the cryptic splice donor of the pseudo exon with AONs likewise promoted GAA exon 2 inclusion. The simultaneous blocking of the cryptic acceptor and cryptic donor sites restored the majority of canonical splicing and alleviated GAA enzyme deficiency. These results highlight the relevance of cryptic splicing in human disease and its potential as therapeutic target for splicing modulation using AONs.	1
A 62-year-old man with dyspnea. ||  || We describe the case of a 62-year-old man who presented with shortness of breath that had progressed over several years. He had a history of a paralyzed right hemidiaphragm for at least the previous 10 years. He also reported weakness in his proximal legs and daytime sleepiness. On examination, he was found to have thoracoabdominal paradox when in supine position. Pulmonary function testing revealed severe restriction; arterial blood gas showed chronic respiratory acidosis. Electromyography showed chronic phrenic neuropathy bilaterally, with mild proximal myopathy. Serum aldolase level was mildly elevated, but serologic tests for connective tissue disorders were within reference range. After extensive clinical investigations, the patient was found to have severely reduced acid α-glucosidase. Genetic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of adult-onset Pompe disease. The patient started treatment with bilevel positive airway pressure titrated during polysomnography, and acid α-glucosidase enzyme replacement was recommended.	1
[Genetic variations in energy balance regulation]. || Animals Energy Metabolism Genetic Variation Humans Leptin Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones Mutation Obesity Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Pro-Opiomelanocortin Proprotein Convertase 1 Proprotein Convertase 2 Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 || Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near certain genes revealed association of FAT(fat mass and obesity-associated gene), MC4R (melanocortin 4 receptor gene), and other genes with obesity. Participation of the FAT expression products in the regulation of energy balance remains to be clarified. The function of MC4R encoding melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is somewhat better understood. alpha-, beta-, and gamma-MSH encoded by the POMC gene bind to MC4R, reduce food intake, and slow down fat accumulation. Expression of POMC that codes MSH is enhanced by leptin binding to the receptor (LepRb) in hypothalamic neurons. Mutations in human and animal MC4R, POMC, and LEP genes are known to be associated with obesity. More than 60 mutations in MC4R, more than 20 mutations in POMC and fewer LEP mutations have been reported. Nonsense mutations and reading frame shifts block gene expression and thereby disrupt protein synthesis. Missense mutations frequently affect protein folding in endoplasmic reticulum; unfolded or misfolded proteins remain in the cytoplasm and undergo degradation. Certain missence mutations do not interfere with gene expression and folding of proteins but impair their functioning at the periphery. P.S127L mutation in MC4R, p.E206X and p.F144L mutations in POMC as well as other mutations in homozygous and heterozygous forms account for disturbed energy balance in man. The LEP gene has been reported to contain G133fsX15, p.R105X, p.R1O5W, and p.S141C mutations. As a rule, they are associated with obesity and other pathological conditions only in homozygous forms.	4
[Prevalence of GJB2 mutations in Uigur and Han ethnic populations with deafness in Xinjiang region of China]. || Adolescent Child China Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genotype Humans Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Surveys and Questionnaires || To investigate the prevalence of GJB2 mutations in Uigur and Han ethnic groups in Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region, China and to understand the mutation spectrum and frequency of the GJB2 gene in these 2 ethnic groups. Questionnaire survey was conducted among 61 Uigur deaf-mute students, 60 Han deaf-mute students, and 98 normal Uigurs and 301 normal Han people as controls. Peripheral blood samples were collected to undergo PCR and sequencing of GJB2 gene. The GJB2 mutation rate of the Uigur deaf-mute students was 19.7%, not significantly different from that of the Han deaf-mute students (17.2%). GJB2 35delG was found only in the Uigur deaf-mutes with a carrier rate of 11.5%, whereas 235delC was identified in both Uigur and Han deaf-mutes. The allelic frequency of 35delG mutation in the Uigur and Han deaf-mutes and the Uigur controls were 7.4% (9/122), 0 (0/128), and 0 (0/196) respectively. The allelic frequencies of the GJB2 235delC mutations in the Uigur and Han deaf-mute students were 5.7% and 9.8%, and the allelic frequencies of 299 - 300delAT were 0.8% and 5.5%. V27I and E114G were the most frequent types of polymorphism. There is a rather high mutation rate of GJB2 gene in Xinjiang. The carrier frequency of 35delG of the Uigurs is significantly higher than that of the Han population. 235delC is common in both Uigur and Han people.	4
Development of a diagnostic DNA chip to screen for 30 autosomal recessive disorders in the Hutterite population. ||  || The Hutterites are a religious isolate living in colonies across the North American prairies. This population originated from approximately 90 founders, resulting in a number of genetic diseases that are overrepresented, underrepresented, or unique. The founder effect in this population increases the likelihood that Hutterite couples carry the same recessive mutations. We have designed a diagnostic chip on a fee-for-service basis with Asper Biotech to provide Hutterites with the option of comprehensive carrier screening. A total of 32 disease-causing mutations in 30 genes were selected and primers were designed for array primer extension-based testing. Selected mutations were limited to those leading to autosomal recessive disorders, maintaining its primary use as a test for determining carrier status. The DNA chip was developed and validated using 59 DNA controls for all but one of the mutations, for which a synthetic control was used. All mutations were readily detected except for a duplication causing restrictive dermopathy where heterozygotes and homozygotes could only be distinguished by sequencing. Blinded testing of 12 additional samples from healthy Hutterites was performed by Asper Biotech using chip testing. All known mutations from previous molecular testing were detected on the chip. As well, additional mutations identified by the chip in these 12 samples were subsequently verified by a second method. Our analysis indicates that the chip is a sensitive and specific means of carrier testing in the Hutterite population and can serve as a model for other founder populations.	4
The spectrum of phenylketonuria genotypes in the Armenian population: identification of three novel mutant PAH alleles. || Alleles Armenia Genotype Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || We present the spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations upon investigating 35 index patients identified with hyperphenylalaninemia in Armenia. One patient was diagnosed with dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency, whereas all other 34 and their 6 affected siblings presented with mild or classical phenylketonuria (PKU). By analyzing all 13 exons plus exon-intron boundaries of the PAH gene, we identified two mutant alleles in 23 PKU patients, three mutations in 1, only one mutation in 5, and no mutation in 5 PKU patients. The most prevalent mutation was the well defined splicing error in intron 10, c.1066-11G>A (17/68 alleles). The three alterations, c.836C>T (p.Pro279Leu) in exon 7, c.1129T>G (p.Tyr377Asp) in exon 11, and c.1244A>T (p.Asp415Val) in exon 12, have not been reported in the PAH locus database (http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca) and, thus, might be specific for the culturally homogenous Armenian population.	1 3
[An attempt to identify the most frequent genomic mutations responsible for isolated deafness in patients after cochlear implantation]. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Cochlear Implantation Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Deafness Female Heterozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational || The aim of this study was to identify subjects with 35delG mutation of GJB2 gene as the most frequent genetic cause of deafness. Deaf patients receiving cochlear implantation at the ENT Clinic at University of Medical Sciences in Poznań and their family members were recruited to the study. Peripheral blood lymphocytes DNA was amplified in allele-specific PCR and analysed for single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) to detect mutation at DFNB1 locus. 35delG mutation at both alleles was found at 42.9% of deaf patients and 29.4% of health relatives were found to be carrier of the mutation at one allele. The study is thought to be a first step in analysis of typical mutations in Polish deaf population.	4
A preclinical evaluation of the MEK inhibitor refametinib in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines including those with acquired resistance to trastuzumab or lapatinib. ||  || The MEK/MAPK pathway is commonly activated in HER2-positive breast cancer, but little investigation of targeting this pathway has been undertaken. Here we present the results of an in vitro preclinical evaluation of refametinib, an allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor, in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines including models of acquired resistance to trastuzumab or lapatinib. A panel of HER2-positive breast cancer cells were profiled for mutational status and also for anti-proliferative response to refametinib alone and in combination with the PI3K inhibitor (PI3Ki) copanlisib and the HER2-targeted therapies trastuzumab and lapatinib. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) was used to determine the effect of refametinib alone and in combination with PI3Ki and HER2-inhibitors on expression and phosphorylation of proteins in the PI3K/AKT and MEK/MAPK pathways. We validated our proteomic in vitro findings by utilising RPPA analysis of patients who received either trastuzumab, lapatinib or the combination of both drugs in the NCT00524303/LPT109096 clinical trial. Refametinib has anti-proliferative effects when used alone in 2/3 parental HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines (HCC1954, BT474), along with 3 models of these 2 cell lines with acquired trastuzumab or lapatinib resistance (6 cell lines tested). Refametinib treatment led to complete inhibition of MAPK signalling. In HCC1954, the most refametinib-sensitive cell line (IC50= 397 nM), lapatinib treatment inhibits phosphorylation of MEK and MAPK but activates AKT phosphorylation, in contrast to the other 2 parental cell lines tested (BT474-P, SKBR3-P), suggesting that HER2 may directly activate MEK/MAPK and not PI3K/AKT in HCC1954 cells but not in the other 2 cell lines, perhaps explaining the refametinib-sensitivity of this cell line. Using RPPA data from patients who received either trastuzumab, lapatinib or the combination of both drugs together with chemotherapy in the NCT00524303 clinical trial, we found that 18% (n=38) of tumours had decreased MAPK and increased AKT phosphorylation 14 days after treatment with HER2-targeted therapies. The combination of MEK inhibition (MEKi) with refametinib and copanlisib led to synergistic inhibition of growth in 4/6 cell lines tested (CI @ED75 = 0.39-0.75), whilst the combinations of lapatinib and refametinib led to synergistic inhibition of growth in 3/6 cell lines (CI @ED75 = 0.39-0.80). Refametinib alone or in combination with copanlisib or lapatinib could represent an improved treatment strategy for some patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, and should be considered for clinical trial evaluation. The direct down-regulation of MEK/MAPK but not AKT signalling by HER2 inhibition (e.g. by lapatinib or trastuzumab), which we demonstrate occurs in 18% of HER2-positive breast cancers may serve as a potential biomarker of responsiveness to the MEK inhibitor refametinib.	0
A comprehensive global genotype-phenotype database for rare diseases. ||  || The ability to discover genetic variants in a patient runs far ahead of the ability to interpret them. Databases with accurate descriptions of the causal relationship between the variants and the phenotype are valuable since these are critical tools in clinical genetic diagnostics. Here, we introduce a comprehensive and global genotype-phenotype database focusing on rare diseases. This database (CentoMD ®) is a browser-based tool that enables access to a comprehensive, independently curated system utilizing stringent high-quality criteria and a quickly growing repository of genetic and human phenotype ontology (HPO)-based clinical information. Its main goals are to aid the evaluation of genetic variants, to enhance the validity of the genetic analytical workflow, to increase the quality of genetic diagnoses, and to improve evaluation of treatment options for patients with hereditary diseases. The database software correlates clinical information from consented patients and probands of different geographical backgrounds with a large dataset of genetic variants and, when available, biomarker information. An automated follow-up tool is incorporated that informs all users whenever a variant classification has changed. These unique features fully embedded in a CLIA/CAP-accredited quality management system allow appropriate data quality and enhanced patient safety. More than 100,000 genetically screened individuals are documented in the database, resulting in more than 470 million variant detections. Approximately, 57% of the clinically relevant and uncertain variants in the database are novel. Notably, 3% of the genetic variants identified and previously reported in the literature as being associated with a particular rare disease were reclassified, based on internal evidence, as clinically irrelevant. The database offers a comprehensive summary of the clinical validity and causality of detected gene variants with their associated phenotypes, and is a valuable tool for identifying new disease genes through the correlation of novel genetic variants with specific, well-defined phenotypes.	4
Screening for Fabry disease and Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis in idiopathic small-fiber and mixed neuropathy. ||  || In this study we assessed the value of genetic screening for Fabry disease (FD) and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis in patients with idiopathic small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) or mixed neuropathy in a clinical setting. This was a Nordic multicenter study with 9 participating centers. Patients with idiopathic SFN or mixed neuropathy were included. Genetic sequencing of the TTR and GLA genes was performed. There were 172 patients enrolled in the study. Genetic screening was performed in 155 patients. No pathogenic mutations in the TTR gene were found. A single patient had a possible pathogenic variant, R118C, in the GLA gene, but clinical investigation showed no firm signs of FD. Screening for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis and FD in patients with idiopathic SFN or mixed neuropathy without any additional disease-specific symptoms or clinical characteristics in a Nordic population appears to be of little value in a clinical setting.

The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations among young Mexican women with triple-negative breast cancer. || Adult BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Mexico Middle Aged Mutation Prevalence Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms Young Adult || Various guidelines recommend that women with triple-negative breast cancer should be tested for BRCA1 mutations, but the prevalence of mutations may vary with ethnic group and with geographic region, and the optimal cutoff age for testing has not been established. We estimated the frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations among 190 women with triple-negative breast cancer, unselected for family history, diagnosed at age 50 or less at a single hospital in Mexico City. Patients were screened for 115 recurrent BRCA mutations, which have been reported previously in women of Hispanic origin, including a common large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 ex9-12del). A BRCA mutation was detected in 44 of 190 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (23 %). Forty-three mutations were found in BRCA1 and one mutation was found in BRCA2. Seven different mutations accounted for 39 patients (89 % of the total mutations). The Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 ex9-12del) was found 18 times and accounted for 41 % of all mutations detected. There is a high prevalence of BRCA1 mutations among young triple-negative breast cancer patients in Mexico. Women with triple-negative breast cancer in Mexico should be screened for mutations in BRCA1.	4
Heterogeneous distribution of BRAF/NRAS mutations among Italian patients with advanced melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genes, Neoplasm Humans Italy Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Prevalence Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Young Adult || Prevalence and distribution of pathogenetic mutations in BRAF and NRAS genes were evaluated in multiple melanoma lesions from patients with different geographical origin within the same Italian population. Genomic DNA from a total of 749 tumor samples (451 primary tumors and 298 metastases) in 513 consecutively-collected patients with advanced melanoma (AJCC stages III and IV) was screened for mutations in exon 15 of BRAF gene and, at lower extension (354/513; 69%), in the entire coding DNA of NRAS gene by automated direct sequencing. Among tissues, 236 paired samples of primary melanomas and synchronous or asynchronous metastases were included into the screening. Overall, mutations were detected in 49% primary melanomas and 51% metastases, for BRAF gene, and 15% primary tumors and 16% secondaries, for NRAS gene. A heterogeneous distribution of mutations in both genes was observed among the 451 primary melanomas according to patients' geographical origin: 61% vs. 42% (p = 0.0372) BRAF-mutated patients and 2% vs. 21% (p < 0.0001) NRAS-mutated cases were observed in Sardinian and non-Sardinian populations, respectively. Consistency in BRAF/NRAS mutations among paired samples was high for lymph node (91%) and visceral metastases (92.5%), but significantly lower for brain (79%; p = 0.0227) and skin (71%; p = 0.0009) metastases. Our findings about the two main alterations occurring in the different tumor tissues from patients with advanced melanoma may be helpful in improving the management of such a disease.	4
The clinical features of patients with the homozygous 235delC and the compound-heterozygous Y136X/G45E of the GJB2 mutations (Connexin 26) in cochlear implant recipients. || Adult Alleles Child, Preschool Cochlear Implants Connexin 26 Connexins Female Gene Deletion Hearing Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Mutation Software Treatment Outcome || This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of GJB2 gene for the 235delC mutations, the clinical features and the outcomes of patients who had undergone cochlear implantation. We have sequenced the coding region of GJB2 gene for 135 patients with sensorineural deaf from September 2000 to May 2009. Of the 135 patients, the patients with the homozygous 235delC and the compound-heterozygous Y136X/G45E were detected and were investigated clinically. The GJB2 gene for the 235delC mutations was found in 39 alleles of 270 alleles (14.4%), especially for the homozygous of 235delC was detected in 26 alleles (9.6%), the single heterozygous of 235delC was 1 allele (0.4%), the compound heterozygous of 235delC was found in 12 alleles (4.4%). Of 16 subjects (29 alleles) with the homozygous 235delC and the compound-heterozygous Y136X/G45E, 2 subjects (4 alleles) were found to have complications. All of the subjects were found to show severe hearing loss and some of them have indicated progressive hearing loss. However, they showed better performance regarding the thresholds after implantation. The subjects with complications, although, suggested poorer performance in the auditory speech performance. The findings of poorer outcomes might depend on complications and brain functions. In addition, considering the blood test parameters, an independent elevated LDH and ChE at diagnosis were found to be associated with hereditary enzyme's metabolic disease. Therefore, the value of LDH measurements in patients might be a helpful predictive parameter in hereditary diseases.	4
Combination treatment with rucaparib (Rubraca) and MDM2 inhibitors, Nutlin-3 and RG7388, has synergistic and dose reduction potential in ovarian cancer. ||  || Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer worldwide for females and the most lethal of all gynecological malignancies. The treatment of ovarian cancer remains a challenge in spite of advances in debulking surgery and changes in both chemotherapy schedules and routes of administration. Cancer treatment has recently been improving with the introduction of targeted therapies to achieve greater specificity and less cytotoxicity. Both PARP inhibitors and MDM2-p53 binding antagonists are targeted therapeutic agents entered into clinical trials. This preclinical study evaluated the effect of Nutlin-3/RG7388 and rucaparib as single agents and in combination together in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. Median-drug-effect analysis showed Nutlin-3/RG7388 combination with rucaparib was additive to, or synergistic in a cell type-dependent manner. Mechanism studies showed rucaparib alone had no effect on p53 stabilization or activity. Although treatment with Nutlin-3 or RG7388 induced stabilization of p53 and upregulation of p21WAF1 and MDM2, the addition of rucaparib did not enhance the p53 activation seen with the MDM2 inhibitors alone. These results demonstrate that the synergistic effect on growth inhibition observed in the combination between rucaparib and Nutlin-3/RG7388 is not the result of increased p53 molecular pathway activation. Nevertheless, combined treatment of Nutlin-3/RG7388 with rucaparib increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which was marked for A2780 and IGROV-1. These data indicate that combination treatment with MDM2 inhibitors and rucaparib has synergistic and dose reduction potential for the treatment of ovarian cancer, dependent on cell type.	0
A rare connexin 26 mutation in a patient with a forme fruste  of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome. || Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Humans Ichthyosis Keratitis Male Mutation Syndrome Young Adult || Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare ectodermal dysplasia characterized by generalized erythrokeratotic plaques, sensorineural hearing loss, and vascularizing keratitis. Cutaneous changes and hearing loss typically present in early childhood, whereas ocular symptoms present later. Mutations in the connexin (Cx) 26 gene, GJB2, are now established to underlie many of the affected cases, with the majority of patients harboring the p.D50N mutation. A rare patient demonstrating features of incomplete KID syndrome associated with an uncommon Cx26 gene mutation is described. The patient presented late in adolescence with partial features of KID syndrome. There was limited cutaneous involvement and the rare association of cystic acne. Both hearing impairment and ophthalmic involvement were mild in severity. Genetic mutation analysis revealed a previously described, rare mutation in GJB2, resulting in a glycine to arginine change at codon 12 (p.G12R). This report describes a patient exhibiting characteristics suggestive of a late-onset, incomplete form of KID syndrome with the GJB2 mutation (p.G12R). The p.G12R mutation has only been described in one other patient with KID syndrome, whose clinical presentation was not characterized.	4
CpG methylation accounts for a recurrent mutation (c.1222C>T) in the human PAH gene. ||  || The human PAH gene (GenBank: U49897.1 (cDNA), AF404777 (gDNA)) harbors alleles that either cause or are associated with hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria (http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca). Mutation analysis has identified approximately 500 alleles of which approximately 30 produce polymorphic core haplotypes. The c.1222C>T allele (p.R408W) is the most prevalent and widely encountered PKU-causing allele. Because it occurs on multiple locus-specific polymorphic haplotypes, it is probably not identical by descent in different populations. This mutation involves a CpG dinucleotide in a so-called "hypermutable" codon suggesting that c.1222C>T could be a recurrent allele following spontaneous methylation-mediated deamination of 5 mC. This concept is widely assumed and accepted but the 5mC status of hypermutable codons has seldom been confirmed. We show that the PAH c.1222C nucleotide is indeed methylated (c.1222 mC) in somatic genomes (leukocyte and brain) of H. sapiens. Examination of a representative region in exon 12 (and also in exon 7) in the PAH gene shows that 5 mC is restricted to cytosines in CpG dinucleotides in the hypermutable codons. The methylation pattern seen in human PAH exon 12 was also observed in the corresponding codon in three nonhuman primates. The finding offers at least one explanation for the high relative frequency of the c.1222C>T (p.R408W) allele in the human population.	3
Identification of different mutational profiles in cancers arising in specific colon segments by next generation sequencing. ||  || The objective of this study was to investigate the mutational profiles of cancers arising in different colon segments. To this aim, we have analyzed 37 colon cancer samples by use of the Ion AmpliSeq™ Comprehensive Cancer Panel. Overall, we have found 307 mutated genes, most of which already implicated in the development of colon cancer. Among these, 15 genes were mutated in tumors originating in all six colon segments and were defined "common genes" (i.e. APC, PIK3CA, TP53) whereas 13 genes were preferentially mutated in tumors originating only in specific colon segments and were defined "site-associated genes" (i.e. BLNK, PTPRD). In addition, the presence of mutations in 10 of the 307 identified mutated genes (NBN, SMUG1, ERBB2, PTPRT, EPHB1, ALK, PTPRD, AURKB, KDR and GPR124) were found to be of clinical relevance. Among clinically relevant genes, NBN and SMUG1 were identified as independent prognostic factors that predicted poor survival in colon cancer patients. In conclusion, the findings reported here indicate that tumors arising in different colon segments present differences in the type and/or frequency of genetic variants, with two of them being independent prognostic factors that predict poor survival in colon cancer patients.	4
Profiling cancer-associated genetic alterations and molecular classification of cancer in Korean gastric cancer patients. ||  || Recently, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network and Asian Cancer Research Group provided a new classification of gastric cancer (GC) to aid the development of biomarkers for targeted therapy and predict prognosis. We studied associations between genetically aberrant profiles of cancer-related genes, environmental factors, and histopathological features in 107 paired gastric tumor-non-tumor tissue GC samples. 6.5% of our GC cases were classified as the EBV subtype, 17.8% as the MSI subtype, 43.0% as the CIN subtype, and 32.7% as the GS subtype. The distribution of four GC subgroups based on the TCGA and our dataset were similar. The MSI subtype showed a hyper-mutated status and the best prognosis among molecular subtype. However, molecular classification based on the four GC subtypes showed no significant survival differences in terms of overall survival (p= 0.548) or relapse-free survival (RFS,p=0.518). The P619fs*43 inZBTB20 was limited to MSI group (n= 5/19, 26.3%), showing similar trends observed in TCGA dataset. Genetic alterations of the RTK/RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were detected in 34.6% of GC cases (37 individual cases). We also found two cases with likely pathogenic variants (NM_004360.4: c. 2494 G>A,p.V832M) in theCDH1 gene. Here, we classified molecular subtypes of GC according to the TCGA system and provide a critical starting point for the design of more appropriate clinical trials based on a comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations in Korean GC patients.	4
p21-induced cycle arrest in G1 protects cells from apoptosis induced by UV-irradiation or RNA polymerase II blockage. || Apoptosis Carcinoma Caspase 3 Caspases Culture Media, Serum-Free Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cyclin-Dependent Kinases Cyclins Cysteine Endopeptidases DNA Damage G1 Phase Mimosine Mutation Periodicity Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases RNA Polymerase II Skin Neoplasms Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ultraviolet Rays || Cells expressing the R273H mutant of p53, which lacks sequence specific DNA binding capacity, do not undergo cell cycle arrest in G1 following exposure to ionizing or UV radiation because of their inability to induce p21Waf1/Cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and downstream mediator of p53-dependent DNA damage-induced growth arrest. Following UV-irradiation or treatment with an inhibitor of RNA pol II, we observed a rapid induction of the apoptotic process, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Using mimosine, a p21Waf1/Cip1 inducer that bypasses the requirement for transcriptional transactivation by p53, we demonstrated that a G1 cell cycle arrest can prevent apoptosis following UV-irradiation or treatment with an RNA polymerase 11 inhibitor. Serum starvation, which also synchronized cells in G1 but did not induce p21Waf1/Cip1, did not protect cells from apoptosis. These results demonstrate that restoring a late G1 checkpoint by inducing p21Waf1/Cip1 expression can protect cells from DNA damage induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that p21Waf1/Cip1 can interrupt the apoptotic process at a point downstream from p53 accumulation but upstream from caspase-3 activation.	0
Serial observations and mutational analysis of an adoptee with family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ||  || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiac disease with an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. Comprehensive genetic screening of several genes frequently found mutated in HCM is recommended for first-degree relatives of HCM patients. Genetic testing provides the means to identify those at risk of developing HCM and to institute measures to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD). Here, we present an adoptee whose natural mother and maternal relatives were known be afflicted with HCM and SCD. The proband was followed closely from age 6 to 17 years, revealing a natural history of the progression of clinical findings associated with HCM. Genetic testing of the proband and her natural mother, who is affected by HCM, revealed that they were heterozygous for both the R719Q and T1513S variants in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) gene. The proband's ominous family history indicates that the combination of the R719Q and T1513S variants in cis may be a "malignant" variant that imparts a poor prognosis in terms of the disease progression and SCD risk.	4
Molecular Genetics and Genotype-Based Estimation of BH4-Responsiveness in Serbian PKU Patients: Spotlight on Phenotypic Implications of p.L48S. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Here, we report the updated spectrum of PAH mutations in 61 Serbian PKU patients. By using both DGGE/DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP, we identified 26 disease-causing mutations (detection rate 99%). The most frequent ones were p.L48S (31%), p.R408W (16.4%), p.P281L (6%), p.E390G (5.2%), and p.I306V (5.2%). Homozygosity value indicated high heterogeneity of Serbian population.To overcome possible pitfalls of patients' phenotypic classification, we used two parameters: pretreatment/maximal phenylalanine blood concentration and Phe tolerance. The two phenotypes did not match only for patients with p.L48S. Therefore, we used Mann-Whitney statistical test to compare pretreatment/maximal blood Phe concentration and Phe tolerance detected in patients with p.[L48S];[null] and p.[missense];[null] genotypes. For patients with p.L48S, our results implied that Phe tolerance is a better parameter for phenotypic classification. Also, Fisher's exact test was used to compare p.L48S effect on phenotype of homozygous and functionally hemizygous patients. Our findings showed that effect of p.L48S was altered in functional hemizygotes. Moreover, phenotypic inconsistency found in homozygotes suggested that interallelic complementation and/or additional factors play a role in genotype-phenotype correlation.Since BH4-supplementation therapy is not available in Serbia, we made the first estimation of its potential benefit based on patients' genotypes. In the analyzed cohort, the total frequency of BH4-responsive mutations was 52.6%. Furthermore, we found a significant number of genotypes (26.2% BH4-responsive and 51% probably BH4-responsive) that may respond to BH4 therapy. This led us to a conclusion that BH4-supplementation therapy could bring benefit to Serbian PKU patients.	1 3
Inhibition of ovarian cancer cell proliferation by a cell cycle inhibitory peptide fused to a thermally responsive polypeptide carrier. || Amino Acid Sequence Apoptosis Blotting, Western Caspases Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Elastin Female Hot Temperature Humans Microscopy, Confocal Molecular Sequence Data Ovarian Neoplasms Peptides Phosphorylation Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases Recombinant Fusion Proteins Retinoblastoma Protein Transition Temperature || Current treatment of solid tumors is limited by normal tissue tolerance, resulting in a narrow therapeutic index. To increase drug specificity and efficacy and to reduce toxicity in normal tissues, we have developed a polypeptide carrier for a cell cycle inhibitory peptide, which has the potential to be thermally targeted to the tumor site. The design of this polypeptide is based on elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). The coding sequence of ELP was modified by the addition of the cell penetrating peptide Bac-7 at the N-terminus and a 23 amino acid peptide derived from p21 at the C-terminus (Bac-ELP1-p21). Bac-ELP1-p21 is soluble in aqueous solutions below physiological temperature (37 degrees C) but aggregates when the temperature is raised above 39 degrees C, making it a promising thermally responsive therapeutic carrier that may be actively targeted to solid tumors by application of focused hyperthermia. While Bac-ELP1-p21 at 37 degrees C did not have any effect on SKOV-3 cell proliferation, the use of hyperthermia increased the antiproliferative effect of Bac-ELP1-p21 compared with a thermally unresponsive control polypeptide. Bac-ELP1-p21 displayed both a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in the SKOV-3 cells, with nuclear-localized polypeptide enriched in the heated cells, as revealed by confocal microscopy. Using Western blotting, we show that Bac-ELP1-p21 caused a decrease in Rb phosphorylation levels in cells treated at 42 degrees C. The polypeptide also induced caspase activation, PARP cleavage, and cell cycle arrest in S-phase and G2/M-phase. These studies indicate that ELP is a promising macromolecular carrier for the delivery of cell cycle inhibitory peptides to solid tumors.	0
Characterization of rare variants in MC4R in African American and/or Latino children with severe early onset obesity. ||  || Mutations in melanocortin receptor (MC4R) are the most frequent cause of monogenic obesity in children of European ancestry, but little is known about their prevalence in children from the minority populations in the United States. This study aims to identify the prevalence of MC4R mutations in children with severe early onset obesity of African-American and/or Latina ancestry. Individuals were recruited from the weight management clinics at two hospitals and from the institutional biobank at a third hospital. Sequencing of the MC4R gene was performed by whole exome and/or Sanger sequencing. Functional testing was performed to establish the surface expression of the receptor and cAMP response to its cognate ligand alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Three hundred and twelve children (1-18 years, 50% girls) with body mass index (BMI) > 120% of 95th percentile of CDC 2000 growth charts at an age < 6 years, with no known pathological cause of obesity were enrolled. Eight rare MC4R mutations (2.6%) were identified in this study (R7S, F202L (n=2), M215I, G252D, V253I, I269N, F284I), three of which have not been previously reported (G252D, F284I, R7S). The pathogenicity of selected variants was confirmed either by prior literature reports, or by functional testing. There was no significant difference in the BMI or height trajectories of children with or without MC4R mutations in this cohort. While the prevalence of MC4R mutations in this cohort was similar to that reported in obese children of European ancestry, some of the variants were novel.	4

MiR-34a chemosensitizes bladder cancer cells to cisplatin treatment regardless of p53-Rb pathway status. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Carcinoma, Transitional Cell Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6 Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans MicroRNAs Retinoblastoma Protein Sirtuin 1 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Urinary Bladder Neoplasms || MiR-34a is a downstream effector of p53 that has been shown to target several molecules associated with cell cycle and cell survival pathways. As alterations in these pathways are frequent in muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (MI-TCC), for example mutation or loss of p53 and Rb, the goal of this study was to determine whether manipulation of miR-34a expression levels could abrogate the effect of these alterations and sensitize bladder cancer cells to chemotherapy. We demonstrate that transfection of T24, TCCSUP and 5637 with pre-miR-34a followed by cisplatin treatment results in a dramatic reduction in clonogenic potential and induction of senescence compared to treatment with cisplatin alone. Molecular analyses identified Cdk6 and sirtuin (SIRT)-1 as being targeted by miR-34a in MI-TCC cells, however, inhibition of Cdk6 and SIRT-1 was not as effective as pre-miR-34a in mediating chemosensitization. Analysis of 27 preneoadjuvant chemotherapy patient samples revealed many of the patients who subsequently did not respond to treatment (based on surgical resection postchemotherapy and 5-year survival data) express lower levels of miR-34a, however, a statistically significant difference between the responder and nonresponder groups was not observed (p = 0.1174). Analysis of eight sets of pre- and postneoadjuvant chemotherapy patient samples determined miR-34a expression increased postchemotherapy in only two of the eight patients. The combined data indicate that elevation of miR-34a expression levels before chemotherapy would be of benefit to MI-TCC patients, particularly in a setting of low miR-34a expression.	0
Baseline results from the UK SIGNIFY study: a whole-body MRI screening study in TP53 mutation carriers and matched controls. || Adult Early Detection of Cancer Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heterozygote Humans Incidence Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Mass Screening Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 United Kingdom Whole Body Imaging Young Adult || In the United Kingdom, current screening guidelines for TP53 germline mutation carriers solely recommends annual breast MRI, despite the wide spectrum of malignancies typically seen in this group. This study sought to investigate the role of one-off non-contrast whole-body MRI (WB MRI) in the screening of asymptomatic TP53 mutation carriers. 44 TP53 mutation carriers and 44 population controls were recruited. Scans were read by radiologists blinded to participant carrier status. The incidence of malignancies diagnosed in TP53 mutation carriers against general population controls was calculated. The incidences of non-malignant relevant disease and irrelevant disease were measured, as well as the number of investigations required to determine relevance of findings. In TP53 mutation carriers, 6 of 44 (13.6, 95% CI 5.2-27.4%) participants were diagnosed with cancer during the study, all of which would be considered life threatening if untreated. Two were found to have two primary cancers. Two participants with cancer had abnormalities on the MRI which were initially thought to be benign (a pericardial cyst and a uterine fibroid) but transpired to be sarcomas. No controls were diagnosed with cancer. Fifteen carriers (34.1, 95% CI 20.5-49.9%) and seven controls (15.9, 95% CI 6.7-30.1%) underwent further investigations following the WB MRI for abnormalities that transpired to be benign (p = 0.049). The cancer detection rate in this group justifies a minimum baseline non-contrast WB MRI in germline TP53 mutation carriers. This should be adopted into national guidelines for management of adult TP53 mutation carriers in addition to the current practice of contrast enhanced breast MRI imaging.	4
Mutation status of RAD51C, PALB2 and BRIP1 in 100 Japanese familial breast cancer cases without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms DNA-Binding Proteins Exons Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Japan Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree RNA Helicases || In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, RAD51C, PALB2 and BRIP1 are known as breast cancer susceptibility genes. However, the mutation status of these genes in Japanese familial breast cancer cases has not yet been evaluated. To this end, we analyzed the exon sequence and genomic rearrangement of RAD51C, PALB2 and BRIP1 in 100 Japanese patients diagnosed with familial breast and ovarian cancer and without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. We detected a large deletion from exons 6 to 9 in RAD51C, 4 novel BRIP1 missense variants containing 3 novel non-synonymous variants, c.89A>C, c.736A>G and c.2131A>G, and a splice donor site variant c.918+2T>C. No deleterious variant of PALB2 was detected. The results of pedigree analysis showed that the proband with a large deletion on RAD51C had a family history of both breast and ovarian cancer, and the families of probands with novel BRIP1 missense variants included a male patient with breast cancer or many patients with breast cancer within the second-degree relatives. We showed that the mutation frequency of RAD51C in Japanese familial breast cancer cases was similar to that in Western countries and that the prevalence of deleterious mutation of PALB2 was possibly lower. Furthermore, our results suggested that BRIP1 mutation frequency in Japan might differ from that in Western countries.	4
Sphingosine-1-phosphate promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation by disrupting Hippo signaling. || Active Transport, Cell Nucleus Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Connective Tissue Growth Factor Cysteine-Rich Protein 61 Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Lysophospholipids Nuclear Proteins Ovarian Neoplasms Phosphorylation Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor) Prognosis Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Signal Transduction Sphingosine Transcription Factors || Epithelial ovarian carcinomas account for more than 90% of human ovarian cancers and have become the primary cause of death for gynecological malignancies. Unlimited cell proliferation and resistance to cell apoptosis contribute to the development of ovarian cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in these processes in epithelial ovarian carcinomas are yet poorly understood. In the present study, we examined the Hippo signaling gene expression and investigated the effects of Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) on cell proliferation and the underlying mechanisms in human ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR3 and SKOV3. Our results demonstrate that S1P disrupts Hippo signaling by reducing YAP phosphorylation and increasing the expression of CCN1 and CCN2 in both ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, the increase in CCN1/CCN2 expression contributes to the S1P-induced increase in cancer cell proliferation.	0
A rare mutation in MYH7 gene occurs with overlapping phenotype. || Adult Aged Amino Acid Substitution Base Sequence Cardiac Myosins DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Distal Myopathies Female Genes, Dominant Genetic Association Studies Humans Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular Myocardium Male Mutant Proteins Mutation, Missense Myopathies, Structural, Congenital Myosin Heavy Chains Pedigree Ultrasonography || Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) cause different muscle disorders. The specific molecular pathobiological processes that cause these different phenotypes remains unexplained. We describe three members of a family with an autosomal dominant mutation in the distal rod of MYH7 [c.5401G> A (p.Glu1801Lys)] displaying a complex phenotype characterized by Laing Distal Myopathy like phenotype, left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and Fiber Type Disproportion picture at muscle biopsy. We suggest that this overlapping presentation confirm the phenotypic variability of MYH7 myopathy and may be helpful to improve the genotype phenotype correlation.	4
Genomic characterization of high-count MBL cases indicates that early detection of driver mutations and subclonal expansion are predictors of adverse clinical outcome. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over B-Lymphocytes Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Clonal Evolution Clone Cells Disease Progression Female Genomics Humans Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell Lymphocyte Count Lymphocytosis Male Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis Time-to-Treatment || High-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is an asymptomatic expansion of clonal B cells in the peripheral blood without other manifestations of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Yearly, 1% of MBLs evolve to CLL requiring therapy; thus being critical to understand the biological events that determine which MBLs progress to intermediate/advanced CLL. In this study, we performed targeted deep sequencing on 48 high-count MBLs, 47 of them with 2-4 sequential samples analyzed, exploring the mutation status of 21 driver genes and evaluating clonal evolution. We found somatic non-synonymous mutations in 25 MBLs (52%) at the initial time point analyzed, including 12 (25%) with >1 mutated gene. In cases that subsequently progressed to CLL, mutations were detected 41 months (median) prior to progression. Excepting NOTCH1, TP53 and XPO1, which showed a lower incidence in MBL, genes were mutated with a similar prevalence to CLL, indicating the early origin of most driver mutations in the MBL/CLL continuum. MBLs with mutations at the initial time point analyzed were associated with shorter time-to-treatment (TTT). Furthermore, MBLs showing subclonal expansion of driver mutations on sequential evaluation had shorter progression time to CLL and shorter TTT. These findings support that clonal evolution has prognostic implications already at the pre-malignant MBL stage, anticipating which individuals will progress earlier to CLL.	4
A method for treatment monitoring using circulating tumour DNA in cancer patients without targetable mutations. ||  || The potentials of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) have been studied for non-invasive disease monitoring in patients with targetable mutations. However, the majority of cancer patients harbour no targetable mutations. A workflow including targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) could be used for monitoring treatment in these patients. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the workflow for ctDNA monitoring in a cohort of non-small cell lung cancer patients. Forty patients were prospectively included. Plasma samples were collected prior to and during treatment. NGS (Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer panel v2) was performed on ctDNA from pre-treatment samples. The identified mutations were monitored by ddPCR in consecutively collected samples. Mutations were detected in 21 patients. The most commonly mutated genes were TP53 (N=20) andKRAS (N=13). Treatment was discontinued due to non-response in 18 patients. In 16 of these, a simultaneous increase in ctDNA concentration was observed. A twofold ctDNA concentration increase confirmed in a second successive sample predicted non-response on the following imaging in 83% of patients (10/12). ctDNA monitoring can be used for early detection of non-response in patients without targetable mutations, and therefore could supplement imaging data for treatment monitoring in this subset of patients.	4
Safety and pharmacodynamic effects of a pharmacological chaperone on α-galactosidase A activity and globotriaosylceramide clearance in Fabry disease: report from two phase 2 clinical studies. || Fabry Disease Humans Male Molecular Chaperones Trihexosylceramides alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease (FD) is a genetic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which leads to globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) accumulation in multiple tissues. We report on the safety and pharmacodynamics of migalastat hydrochloride, an investigational pharmacological chaperone given orally at 150 mg every-other-day. Two open-label uncontrolled phase 2 studies of 12 and 24 weeks (NCT00283959 and NCT00283933) in 9 males with FD were combined. At multiple time points, α-Gal A activity and GL-3 levels were quantified in blood cells, kidney and skin. GL-3 levels were also evaluated through skin and renal histology. Compared to baseline, increased α-Gal A activity of at least 50% was demonstrated in blood, skin and kidney in 6 of 9 patients. Patients' increased α-Gal A activities paralleled the α-Gal A increases observed in vitro in HEK-293 cells transfected with the corresponding mutant form of the enzyme. The same 6 patients who demonstrated increases of α-Gal A activity also had GL-3 reduction in skin, urine and/or kidney, and had α-Gal A mutations that responded in transfected cells incubated with the drug. The 3 patients who did not show a consistent response in vivo had α-Gal A mutations that did not respond to migalastat HCl in transfected cells. Migalastat HCl was well tolerated. Migalastat HCl is a candidate pharmacological chaperone that provides a novel genotype-specific treatment for FD. It enhanced α-Gal A activity and resulted in GL-3 substrate decrease in patients with responsive GLA mutations. Phase 3 studies are ongoing.	0
LAMP3 plays an oncogenic role in osteosarcoma cells partially by inhibiting TP53. || Apoptosis Bone Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Humans Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins Neoplasm Proteins Osteosarcoma RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common malignant tumor that predominantly occurs in adolescents. Its most common metastasis is to the lungs. As shown in our earlier study, lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 3 (LAMP3) is highly upregulated in metastatic OS. However, its role in the regulation of OS cell viability and apoptosis remains unknown. We knocked down and overexpressed LAMP3 in OS cells and assessed the cell viability and apoptosis. Then, we investigated the expression of apoptosis-associated genes to identify the downstream gene(s) ofLAMP3. Knockdown of LAMP3 significantly inhibited OS cell viability and promoted apoptosis.TP53, which is involved in the apoptosis pathway, was found to be highly upregulated after knockdown ofLAMP3. Overexpression ofLAMP3 significantly increased cell viability and abrogated apoptosis. Importantly, subsequent knockdown ofTP53 partially suppressed the increased OS cell apoptosis induced by the inhibition ofLAMP3, suggesting thatTP53 is a key functional downstream gene ofLAMP3. Our findings suggest that LAMP3 promotes OS cell viability and survival by regulatingTP53 expression.	0
Protumorigenic overexpression of stathmin/Op18 by gain-of-function mutation in p53 in human hepatocarcinogenesis. || Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Humans Liver Neoplasms RNA, Small Interfering Stathmin Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The microtubule (MT)-destabilizing protein stathmin/Op18 has previously been described to be negatively regulated by p53 and to be highly expressed in several tumor entities. However, little is known about its expression profile, functional or therapeutic relevance, and regulation in human hepatocarcinogenesis. Here we demonstrate cytoplasmic overexpression of stathmin in premalignant lesions (dysplastic nodules; DNs) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), which significantly correlated with tumor progression, proliferation, and activation of other protumorigenic factors (e.g., nuclear p53). Inhibition of stathmin expression by gene-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) was associated with a significant reduction of MT-dependent cellular functions such as tumor cell viability, proliferation, migration, and increased apoptosis in HCC cells. Loss of stathmin expression increased responsiveness of tumor cells to the treatment with cytostatic drugs targeting MT-stability (paclitaxel, vinblastine) and to DNA cross-linking agents (cisplatin). Surprisingly, inducible expression of p53(wt) in p53-negative HCC cells as well as a reduction of p53(wt) by siRNA in p53(wt)-positive cells did not alter stathmin expression. However, stathmin was down-regulated after siRNA-based reduction of p53(mut/Y220C) and p53(mut/R213Q) expression in different tumor cell types. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of stathmin is an early protumorigenic event in human hepatocarcinogenesis, and its up-regulation can be mediated by gain-of-function mutations in p53. Thus, stathmin represents a potential therapeutic target, for example, by increasing responsiveness of tumor cells to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents after reduction of stathmin bioactivity.	0
Mutational and phenotypic spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in Zhejiang Province, China. ||  || Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAHD), one of the genetic disorders resulting in hyperphenylalaninemia, has a complex phenotype with many variants and genotypes among different populations. Here, we describe the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of PAHD in a cohort of 420 patients from neonatal screening between 1999 and 2016. The observed phenotypes comprised 43.57% classic phenylketonuria, 33.10% mild PKU, and 23.33% mild hyperphenylalaninemia, with an overall PAHD incidence of 1 in 20,445. Genetic testing was performed for 209 patients and 72 variants including seven novel variants were identified. These included two synonymous and five pathogenic nonsynonymous variants (p.S36*, p.T186I, p.L255W, p.F302V and p.R413H). The most common variant among all patients was p.R243Q, followed by p.R241C, p.Y204C, p.R111* and c.442-1G > A. Variants p.R53H and p.F392I occurred only in MHP with 19.3% and 8.0% of the observed alleles respectively. The genotypes p.[R241C];[R243Q], p.[R243Q];[R243Q], and p.[Y204C];[R243Q] were abundant across all PAHD patients. The distributions of the null allele and the three defined genotypes, null/null, null/missense, and missense/missense, were significantly different between the cPKU and mPKU patients. However, no significant differences were found between mPKU and MHP patients, indicating that other modifier factors influence the phenotypic outcome in these patients. The data presented here will provide a valuable tool for improved genetic counseling and management of future cases of PAHD in China.	1 3
Heat-transfer-based detection of SNPs in the PAH gene of PKU patients. || Base Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Molecular Sequence Data Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity Thermography Transition Temperature || Conventional neonatal diagnosis of phenylketonuria is based on the presence of abnormal levels of phenylalanine in the blood. However, for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis, direct detection of disease-correlated mutations is needed. To speed up and simplify mutation screening in genes, new technologies are developed. In this study, a heat-transfer method is evaluated as a mutation-detection technology in entire exons of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. This method is based on the change in heat-transfer resistance (R(th)) upon thermal denaturation of dsDNA (double-stranded DNA) on nanocrystalline diamond. First, ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) fragments that span the size range of the PAH exons were successfully immobilized on nanocrystalline diamond. Next, it was studied whether an R(th) change could be observed during the thermal denaturation of these DNA fragments after hybridization to their complementary counterpart. A clear R(th) shift during the denaturation of exon 5, exon 9, and exon 12 dsDNA was observed, corresponding to lengths of up to 123 bp. Finally, R(th) was shown to detect prevalent single-nucleotide polymorphisms, c.473G>A (R158Q), c.932T>C (p.L311P), and c.1222C>T (R408W), correlated with phenylketonuria, displaying an effect related to the different melting temperatures of homoduplexes and heteroduplexes.	3
Mutant p53-Notch1 Signaling Axis Is Involved in Curcumin-Induced Apoptosis of Breast Cancer Cells. ||  || Notch1 has been reported to be highly expressed in triple-negative and other subtypes of breast cancer. Mutant p53 (R280K) is overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative human breast cancer cells. The present study aimed to determine whether the mutant p53 can be a potent transcriptional activator of the Notch1 in MDA-MB-231 cells, and explore the role of this mutant p53-Notch1 axis in curcumin-induced apoptosis. We found that curcumin treatment resulted in an induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, together with downregulation of Notch1 and its downstream target, Hes1. This reduction in Notch1 expression was determined to be due to the decreased activity of endogenous mutant p53. We confirmed the suppressive effect of curcumin on Notch1 transcription by performing a Notch1 promoter-driven reporter assay and identified a putative p53-binding site in the Notch1 promoter by EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Overexpression of mutant p53 increased Notch1 promoter activity, whereas knockdown of mutant p53 by small interfering RNA suppressed Notch1 expression, leading to the induction of cellular apoptosis. Moreover, curcumin-induced apoptosis was further enhanced by the knockdown of Notch1 or mutant p53, but it was decreased by the overexpression of active Notch1. Taken together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that Notch1 is a transcriptional target of mutant p53 in breast cancer cells and suggest that the targeting of mutant p53 and/or Notch1 may be combined with a chemotherapeutic strategy to improve the response of breast cancer cells to curcumin.	0
Atypical case of Wolfram syndrome revealed through targeted exome sequencing in a patient with suspected mitochondrial disease. || Atrophy Brain DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Diagnosis, Differential Exome Exons High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Homozygote Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mitochondrial Diseases Mutation, Missense Wolfram Syndrome || Mitochondrial diseases comprise a diverse set of clinical disorders that affect multiple organ systems with varying severity and age of onset. Due to their clinical and genetic heterogeneity, these diseases are difficult to diagnose. We have developed a targeted exome sequencing approach to improve our ability to properly diagnose mitochondrial diseases and apply it here to an individual patient. Our method targets mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the exons of 1,600 nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biology or Mendelian disorders with multi-system phenotypes, thereby allowing for simultaneous evaluation of multiple disease loci. Targeted exome sequencing was performed on a patient initially suspected to have a mitochondrial disorder. The patient presented with diabetes mellitus, diffuse brain atrophy, autonomic neuropathy, optic nerve atrophy, and a severe amnestic syndrome. Further work-up revealed multiple heteroplasmic mtDNA deletions as well as profound thiamine deficiency without a clear nutritional cause. Targeted exome sequencing revealed a homozygous c.1672C > T (p.R558C) missense mutation in exon 8 of WFS1 that has previously been reported in a patient with Wolfram syndrome. This case demonstrates how clinical application of next-generation sequencing technology can enhance the diagnosis of patients suspected to have rare genetic disorders. Furthermore, the finding of unexplained thiamine deficiency in a patient with Wolfram syndrome suggests a potential link between WFS1 biology and thiamine metabolism that has implications for the clinical management of Wolfram syndrome patients.	4
The Potential of CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing as a Treatment Strategy for Alzheimer's Disease. ||  || Despite a wealth of knowledge gained in the past three decades concerning the molecular underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease (AD), progress towards obtaining effective, disease modifying therapies has proven to be challenging. In this manner, numerous clinical trials targeting the production, aggregation, and toxicity of beta-amyloid, have failed to meet efficacy standards. This puts into question the beta-amyloid hypothesis and suggests that additional treatment strategies should be explored. The recent emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing as a relatively straightforward, inexpensive, and precise system has led to an increased interest of applying this technique in AD. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can be used as a direct treatment approach or to help establish better animal models that more faithfully mimic human neurodegenerative diseases. In this manner, this technique has already shown promise in other neurological disorders, such as Huntington's disease. The purpose of this review is to examine the potential utility of CRISPR/Cas9 as a treatment option for AD by targeting specific genes including those that cause early-onset AD, as well as those that are significant risk factors for late-onset AD such as the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) gene.	4

Circulating tumor DNA shows variable clonal response of breast cancer during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ||  || Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) correlates with tumor burden and provides early detection of treatment response and tumor genetic alterations in breast cancer (BC). In this study, we aimed to identify genetic alterations during the process of tumor clonal evolution and examine if ctDNA level well indicated clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and BC recurrence. We performed targeted ultra-deep sequencing of plasma DNAs, matched germline DNAs and tumor DNAs from locally advanced BC patients. Serial plasma DNAs were collected at diagnosis, after the 1st cycle of NAC and after curative surgery. For the target enrichment, we designed RNA baits covering a total of ∼202kb regions of the human genome including a total of 82 cancer-related genes. For ctDNA, 15 serial samples were collected and 87% of plasma SNVs were detected in 13 BC samples that had somatic alterations in tumor tissues. TheTP53 mutation was most commonly detected in primary tumor tissues and plasma followed byBRCA1 andBRCA2. At BC diagnosis, the amount of plasma SNVs did not correlate with clinical stage at diagnosis. With respect to the therapeutic effects of NAC, we found two samples in which ctDNA disappeared after the 1st NAC cycle achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR). In addition, the amount of ctDNA correlated with residual cancer volume detected by breast MRI. This targeted ultra-deep sequencing for ctDNA analysis would be useful for monitoring tumor burden and drug resistance. Most of all, we suggest that ctDNA could be the earliest predictor of NAC response.	4
Impact of the p53 status of tumor cells on extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling. ||  || The p53 protein is the best studied target in human cancer. For decades, p53 has been believed to act mainly as a tumor suppressor and by transcriptional regulation. Only recently, the complex and diverse function of p53 has attracted more attention. Using several molecular approaches, we studied the impact of different p53 variants on extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling. We reproduced the previously published results within intrinsic apoptosis induction: while wild-type p53 promoted cell death, different p53 mutations reduced apoptosis sensitivity. The prediction of the impact of the p53 status on the extrinsic cell death induction was much more complex. The presence of p53 in tumor cell lines and primary xenograft tumor cells resulted in either augmented, unchanged or reduced cell death. The substitution of wild-type p53 by mutant p53 did not affect the extrinsic apoptosis inducing capacity. In summary, we have identified a non-expected impact of p53 on extrinsic cell death induction. We suggest that the impact of the p53 status of tumor cells on extrinsic apoptosis signaling should be studied in detail especially in the context of therapeutic approaches that aim to restore p53 function to facilitate cell death via the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.	0
Computational and biochemical characterization of two partially overlapping interfaces and multiple weak-affinity K-Ras dimers. || Computational Biology Models, Molecular Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Multimerization ras Proteins || Recent studies found that membrane-bound K-Ras dimers are important for biological function. However, the structure and thermodynamic stability of these complexes remained unknown because they are hard to probe by conventional approaches. Combining data from a wide range of computational and experimental approaches, here we describe the structure, dynamics, energetics and mechanism of assembly of multiple K-Ras dimers. Utilizing a range of techniques for the detection of reactive surfaces, protein-protein docking and molecular simulations, we found that two largely polar and partially overlapping surfaces underlie the formation of multiple K-Ras dimers. For validation we used mutagenesis, electron microscopy and biochemical assays under non-denaturing conditions. We show that partial disruption of a predicted interface through charge reversal mutation of apposed residues reduces oligomerization while introduction of cysteines at these positions enhanced dimerization likely through the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. Free energy calculations indicated that K-Ras dimerization involves direct but weak protein-protein interactions in solution, consistent with the notion that dimerization is facilitated by membrane binding. Taken together, our atomically detailed analyses provide unique mechanistic insights into K-Ras dimer formation and membrane organization as well as the conformational fluctuations and equilibrium thermodynamics underlying these processes.	0
Prevalence of the c.35delG and p.W24X mutations in the GJB2 gene in patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss from North-West Romania. || Connexin 26 Connexins Gene Frequency Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Hearing Tests Humans Mutation Otoscopy Polymerase Chain Reaction Prevalence Romania Severity of Illness Index || In Central and South-Eastern European countries, the most frequent mutation types responsible for congenital nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL) are c.35delG and p.W24X (15-55.8% and 2.5-4.3%, respectively). The aim of the study was to determine for the first time in Romania the prevalence of c.35delG and p.W24X mutations in patients with NSHL. 75 unrelated children with NSHL from Transylvania (North-West Romania). a. Audiological examination (otoscopy, tympanogram, acoustic otoemission and tonal audiogram or auditory evoked potentials); b. detection of the c.35delG (semi-nested-PCR, RFLP and ARMS-PCR analysis) and p.W24X (ARMS-PCR analysis) mutations. Audiological examination allowed the diagnosis of hearing loss of various degrees: moderate in 8 patients (10.7%), severe in 14 cases (18.7%), profound in 53 patients (70.6%). The number of reported mutation cases as against the number of alleles indicates a 33.3% frequency rate for c.35delG mutation and respectively 5.3% for p.W24X mutation. All 22 patients with 35delG/c.35delG genotype (19 patients), c.35delG/p.W24X genotype (2 patients) or p.W24X/p.W24X genotype (1 patient) presented profound/severe hearing loss. Our study confirms that the frequency rate of the two mutations analyzed in patients with NSHL from North-West Romania is comparable to that seen in other Central and South-Eastern European countries. The homozygote or compound heterozygote states represent a major risk factor for profound or severe deafness. Audiological screening in newborns and genetic testing in confirmed congenital hypoacusis cases are compulsory for early therapeutic intervention (hearing prosthesis or cochlear implant) and genetic counselling.	4
GJB2 and GJB6 mutations in 165 Danish patients showing non-syndromic hearing impairment. || Adolescent Adult Aged Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Denmark Female Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Sequence Deletion || Thirty-two genes causing non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) have been cloned, including GJB2 and GJB6 encoding the gap junction subunits connexin 26 and connexin 30, respectively. One mutation in GJB2, 35delG, accounts for a large percentage of GJB2 hearing impairment in Southern Europe whereas a considerably lower frequency has been reported from Northern European populations. Recently, a 342-kb deletion implicating GJB6 was found in 22 out of 44 NSHI patients of Spanish origin with only one mutated allele of GJB2. We report the first study of GJB2 and GJB6 mutations in Danish patients with NSHI. We tested 165 individuals and found GJB2 mutations in 16 individuals. The deletion implicating GJB6 was found in two individuals out of 9 heterozygous for GJB2 mutation. Furthermore, we screened 509 unselected samples from the Danish newborn population for the 35delG mutation in GJB2. We found 9 samples heterozygous for 35delG and 11 samples heterozygous for mutations leading to amino acid variants in GJB2 protein. In conclusion, our data are in accordance with results from other Northern European populations. Furthermore, our data on the GJB6 deletion suggest that routine screening for this deletion could help to explain hearing impairment in some Northern European NSHI patients heterozygous for a mutation in GJB2.	4
Mutant p53 partners in crime. || Gain of Function Mutation Humans Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Transcription Factors Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutant p53 proteins impart changes in cellular behavior and function through interactions with proteins that alter gene expression. The milieu of intracellular proteins available to interact with mutant p53 is context specific and changes with disease, cell type, and environmental conditions. Varying conformations of mutant p53 largely dictate protein-protein interactions as different point mutations within protein-coding regions greatly alter the extent and array of gain-of-function (GOF) activities. Given such variables, how can knowledge regarding p53 missense mutations be translated into predicting or altering biologic activity for therapy? How may knowledge regarding mutant p53 functions within certain disease contexts be harnessed to blunt or ablate mutant p53 GOF for therapy? In this article, we review known proteins that interact with mutant p53 and result in the activation of genes that contribute to p53 GOF with particular emphasis on context dependency and an evolving appreciation of GOF mechanisms.	0
Higher-than-expected population prevalence of potentially pathogenic germline TP53 variants in individuals unselected for cancer history. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Databases, Genetic Exome Family Female Genetic Variation Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Middle Aged Penetrance Prevalence Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Whole Exome Sequencing || Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition disorder associated with pathogenic germline variants in TP53, with a high penetrance over an individual's lifetime. The actual population prevalence of pathogenic germline TP53 mutations is still unclear, most likely due to biased selection of cancer affected families. The aim of this study was to estimate the population prevalence of potentially pathogenic TP53 exonic variants in three sequencing databases, totaling 63,983 unrelated individuals. Potential pathogenicity was defined using an original algorithm combining bioinformatic prediction tools, suggested clinical significance, and functional data. We identified 34 different potentially pathogenic TP53 variants in 131 out of 63,983 individuals (0.2%). Twenty-eight (82%) of these variants fell within the DNA-binding domain of TP53, with an enrichment for specific variants that were not previously identified as LFS mutation hotspots, such as the p.R290H and p.N235S variants. Our findings reveal that the population prevalence of potentially pathogenic TP53 variants may be up to 10 times higher than previously estimated from family-based studies. These results point to the need for further studies aimed at evaluating cancer penetrance modifiers as well as the risk associated between cancer and rare TP53 variants.	4
Gain of function mutant p53 proteins cooperate with E2F4 to transcriptionally downregulate RAD17 and BRCA1 gene expression. || BRCA1 Protein Breast Neoplasms Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor DNA Damage Down-Regulation E2F4 Transcription Factor Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, BRCA1 Genes, p53 Genomic Instability Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans Lung Neoplasms Mutation Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Genomic instability (IN) is a common feature of many human cancers. The TP53 tumour suppressor gene is mutated in approximately half of human cancers. Here, we show that BRCA1 and RAD17 genes, whose derived proteins play a pivotal role in DNA damage repair, are transcriptional targets of gain-of-function mutant p53 proteins. Indeed, high levels of mutp53 protein facilitate DNA damage accumulation and severely impair BRCA1 and RAD17 expression in proliferating cancer cells. The recruitment of mutp53/E2F4 complex onto specific regions of BRCA1 and RAD17 promoters leads to the inhibition of their expression. BRCA1 and RAD17 mRNA expression is reduced in HNSCC patients carrying TP53 mutations when compared to those bearing wt-p53 gene. Furthermore, the analysis of gene expression databases for breast cancer patients reveals that low expression of DNA repair genes correlates significantly with reduced relapse free survival of patients carrying TP53 gene mutations. Collectively, these findings highlight the direct involvement of transcriptionally active gain of function mutant p53 proteins in genomic instability through the impairment of DNA repair mechanisms.	0

Prospective case series. Ophthalmologic examinations with photography of the cornea after instillation of fluorescein were performed in 98 family members with 61 mutation carriers of four DFNA9 families at the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre. Families 1 and 2 harbor the Pro51Ser mutation, and families 3 and 4 harbor the Gly88Glu and the Gly87Trp mutation, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed to find an association between the vertical corneal striae and the COCH mutation for each family and to test whether the four families were different in this respect. The vertical corneal striae were exclusively visible after instillation of fluorescein. They caused minor problems, as dry eye symptoms, and were not present in the general Dutch ophthalmologic population. The striae were present from an age of 47 years in 32 individuals, of whom 27 individuals had a COCH mutation. Statistical analysis on the striae and the COCH mutations showed a significant association in families 1, 2, and 3 (P = .0006), but not in family 4 (P = .63). Data analysis demonstrated a significant association between vertical corneal striae and the Pro51Ser and Gly88Glu mutations in the COCH gene in DFNA9 families 1, 2, and 3 with cochleovestibular dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the vertical corneal striae and cochleovestibular dysfunction may be caused by the same COCH mutations.	4
Confirmation of cause and manner of death via a comprehensive cardiac autopsy including whole exome next-generation sequencing. || Adolescent Amino Acid Substitution Autopsy Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Cause of Death DNA Death, Sudden Exome Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Myocardium Myosin Heavy Chains Sequence Analysis, DNA || Annually, the sudden death of thousands of young people remains inadequately explained despite medicolegal investigation. Postmortem genetic testing for channelopathies/cardiomyopathies may illuminate a potential cardiac mechanism and establish a more accurate cause and manner of death and provide an actionable genetic marker to test surviving family members who may be at risk for a fatal arrhythmia. Whole exome sequencing allows for simultaneous genetic interrogation of an individual's entire estimated library of approximately 30000 genes. Following an inconclusive autopsy, whole exome sequencing and gene-specific surveillance of all known major cardiac channelopathy/cardiomyopathy genes (90 total) were performed on autopsy blood-derived genomic DNA from a previously healthy 16-year-old adolescent female found deceased in her bedroom. Whole exome sequencing analysis revealed a R249Q-MYH7 mutation associated previously with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sudden death, and impaired β-myosin heavy chain (MHC-β) actin-translocating and actin-activated ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) activity. Whole exome sequencing may be an efficient and cost-effective approach to incorporate molecular studies into the conventional postmortem examination.	4
A South African family with the mitochondrial A1555G mutation on haplogroup L0d. || Aminoglycosides Anti-Bacterial Agents Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Deafness Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Haplotypes Humans Mitochondrial Proteins Mutation Pedigree South Africa tRNA Methyltransferases || The most common mutation associated with aminoglycoside-induced deafness is A1555G and it has been found in diverse populations worldwide. In the present study we investigated a large South African family known to harbour A1555G. A total of 97 family members were genotyped using the SNaPshot technique and 76 were found to be A1555G-positive (on haplogroup L0d) and are therefore at risk of developing irreversible hearing loss. The method worked equally well on both blood (from adults) and buccal swabs (from children). Variants in the tRNA(Ser(UCN)), A10S in TRMU and 35delG in GJB2 genes were shown not to act as genetic modifiers in this family. It is important to identify mutation-positive individuals and inform them of their increased risk of developing aminoglycoside-induced deafness especially in a setting like South Africa where these drugs are still commonly used because of their efficacy and cost-effectiveness as a treatment for resistant forms of tuberculosis.	4
The neonatal tetrahydrobiopterin loading test in phenylketonuria: what is the predictive value? || Adolescent Biopterin Child Diagnostic Tests, Routine Female Humans Infant, Newborn Male Phenylketonurias || It is unknown whether the neonatal tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) loading test is adequate to diagnose long-term BH4 responsiveness in PKU. Therefore we compared the predictive value of the neonatal (test I) versus the 48-h BH4 loading test (test II) and long-term BH4 responsiveness. Data on test I (>1991, 20 mg/kg) at T = 8 (n = 85) and T = 24 (n = 5) were collected and compared with test II and long-term BH4 responsiveness at later age, with ≥30% Phe decrease used as the cut-off. The median (IQR) age at hospital diagnosis was 9 (7-11) days and the age at test II was 11.8 (6.6-13.7) years. The baseline Phe concentrations at test I were significantly higher compared to test II (1309 (834-1710) versus 514 (402-689) μmol/L, respectively, P = 0.000). 15/85 patients had a positive test I T = 8. All, except one patient who was not tested for long-term BH4 responsiveness, showed long-term BH4 responsiveness. In 20/70 patients with a negative test I T = 8, long-term BH4 responsiveness was confirmed. Of 5 patients with a test I T = 24, 1/5 was positive at both tests and showed long-term BH4 responsiveness, 2/5 had negative results at both tests and 2/5 showed a negative test I T = 24, but a positive test II with 1/2 showing long-term BH4 responsiveness. Both a positive neonatal 8- and 24-h BH4 loading test are predictive for long-term BH4 responsiveness. However, a negative test does not rule out long-term BH4 responsiveness. Other alternatives to test for BH4 responsiveness at neonatal age should be investigated.	1 3
Thin filament mutations: developing an integrative approach to a complex disorder. || Actin Cytoskeleton Animals Calcium Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Genotype Humans Kinetics Mutation Myocardium Phenotype Tropomyosin Troponin || Sixteen years ago, mutations in cardiac troponin (Tn)T and α-tropomyosin were linked to familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, thus transforming the disorder from a disease of the β-myosin heavy chain to a disease of the cardiac sarcomere. From the outset, studies suggested that mutations in the regulatory thin filament caused a complex, heterogeneous pattern of ventricular remodeling with wide variations in clinical expression. To date, the clinical heterogeneity is well matched by an extensive array of nearly 100 independent mutations in all components of the cardiac thin filament. Significant advances in our understanding of the biophysics of myofilament activation, coupled to the emerging evidence that thin filament linked cardiomyopathies are progressive, suggests that a renewed focus on the most proximal events in both the molecular and clinical pathogenesis of the disease will be necessary to achieve the central goal of using genotype information to manage affected patients. In this review, we examine the existing biophysical and clinical evidence in support of a more proximal definition of thin filament cardiomyopathies. In addition, new high-resolution, integrated approaches are presented to help define the way forward as the field works toward developing a more robust link between genotype and phenotype in this complex disorder.	4
Combination of Proteasome and Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Overcomes the Impact of Gain-of-Function p53 Mutations. ||  || Mutations in the "guardian of the genome" TP53 predominate in solid tumors. In addition to loss of tumor suppressor activity, a specific subset of missense mutations confers additional oncogenic properties. These "gain-of-function" (GOF) mutations portend poor prognosis across cancer types regardless of treatment. Our objective in this study was to identify novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome the deleterious effects of GOFTP53 mutants. Using gynecologic cancer cell lines with knownTP53 mutational status, we established that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor induced cell death in cells with two recurrent GOFTP53 mutations (R175H and R248Q), and addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) enhanced this effect. By contrast, p53-null cancer cells were relatively resistant to the combination. Proteasome inhibition promoted apoptosis of cells withTP53 GOF mutations, potentially through induction of the unfolded protein response. In line with the reported hyperstabilization of GOF p53 protein, cells treated with HDACi exhibited reduced levels of p53 protein. Together, these data form the basis for future clinical studies examining therapeutic efficacy in a preselected patient population with GOFTP53 mutations.	0
Structural and functional characterization of a DARPin which inhibits Ras nucleotide exchange. || Ankyrin Repeat Antibodies Cell Proliferation Drug Design HCT116 Cells HEK293 Cells Humans Molecular Structure Molecular Targeted Therapy ras Proteins || Ras mutations are the oncogenic drivers of many human cancers and yet there are still no approved Ras-targeted cancer therapies. Inhibition of Ras nucleotide exchange is a promising new approach but better understanding of this mechanism of action is needed. Here we describe an antibody mimetic, DARPin K27, which inhibits nucleotide exchange of Ras. K27 binds preferentially to the inactive Ras GDP form with a Kd of 4 nM and structural studies support its selectivity for inactive Ras. Intracellular expression of K27 significantly reduces the amount of active Ras, inhibits downstream signalling, in particular the levels of phosphorylated ERK, and slows the growth in soft agar of HCT116 cells. K27 is a potent, non-covalent inhibitor of nucleotide exchange, showing consistent effects across different isoforms of Ras, including wild-type and oncogenic mutant forms.	0

Super-Transactivation TP53 Variant in the Germline of a Family with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. || Adult Cell Line Child Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Male Pedigree Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome, characterized by multiple malignancies and frequent germline alterations in TP53. In this study, we highlight four unclassified exonic TP53 variants detected in patients with a suspected diagnosis of LFS. Most intriguing was the discovery of a "super-transactivation" variant within Exon 10 of TP53 (c.1079G>T/p.G360V). Functional analysis of this novel variant revealed a paradoxical "super-transactivation" effect on tp53 response elements and a corresponding tumor suppressive effect on colony formation and apoptosis. While unlikely to be disease-causing, we propose that this variant may represent a novel tp53 polymorphism and potential phenotypic modifier in LFS. In the future, the enhanced transactivation effects of p.G360V-tp53 may also prove useful in designing more efficacious tp53-based gene therapies.	4
[Typical features of craniofacial growth of the FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis syndrome (so-called Muenke craniosynostosis)]. || Amino Acid Substitution Arginine Cephalometry Child Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses Female Follow-Up Studies Frontal Bone Humans Infant Male Orbit Point Mutation Postoperative Complications Proline Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Radiography Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor || The FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis syndrome (Muenke craniosynostosis) is caused by a point mutation (C749G) on the FGFR3 gene resulting in a Pro250Arg substitution. To characterize this malformation, the neuro- and viscerocranium were analyzed by axial CT scans of the skull and cephalometric radiographs of up to 13 affected children before and in part after fronto-orbital advancement. Preoperative analysis of the intracranial volume of four patients showed a mean decrease of 3.6%, indicating a compensatory growth pattern of the skull in cases of coronal synostosis. The typical brachycephaly could be verified by the significant shortening of the skull length of 13.2% on average and by the significant reduction of the anterior cranial base length of maximal 5.9% on average. The anterior part of the skull was characterized by a significant mean increase of the intercoronal distance of 8.6%, which indicates a compensatory transversal growth in this malformation. The widened bilateral interorbital and anterior interorbital distances were increased by 7.3 or 9.0%, respectively, confirming a hypertelorism typical for this syndrome. The "frontal bossing" frequently found in brachycephaly was characterized by the preoperatively increased sagittal extension of the forehead (about 112.9% above the norm) and by the increased height of the frontal prominence (about 47.8% above the norm). Following surgery, both variables defining the morphology of the forehead were reduced and appeared to be constant throughout the follow-up. Hypoplasia of the midface described by Muenke et al. (1997) was confirmed in the present study only by the significant reduction of the sagittal length of the maxillary base, which was decreased by 6.8%. In accordance with the current literature, the skull configuration described for Muenke craniosynostosis shows similarities with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.	4
Genomic duplication of PTPN11 is an uncommon cause of Noonan syndrome. || Adult Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Gene Duplication Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome, Human Humans Male Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 || Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused most commonly by activating mutations in PTPN11. We report a patient with hypotonia, developmental delay and clinical features suggestive of NS. High-resolution chromosome analysis was normal, and sequence analyses of PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, BRAF, RAF1, MEK, and MEK2 were also normal. Array CGH revealed a single copy gain of 9 BAC clones at 12q24.11q24.21 (8.98 Mb in size), which encompassed the PTPN11 locus at 12q24.13 and was confirmed by FISH analysis. Shchelochkov et al. [Shchelochkov et al. (2008); Am J Med Genet Part A 146A:1042-1048] reported a similar case and speculated that such duplications might account for 15-30% of NS cases with no detectable mutation in NS genes. We screened more than 250 NS cases without mutation in known NS disease-causing genes by quantitative PCR, and none of these studies produced results in the duplicated range. We also explored the possibility that de novo changes affecting the untranslated region (UTR) of the PTPN11 transcript might represent an alternative event involved in SHP2 enhanced expression. DHPLC analysis and direct sequencing of the entire 3' UTR in 36 NS patients without mutation in known genes did not show any disease-associated variant. These findings indicate that duplications of PTPN11 represent an uncommon cause of NS, and functionally relevant variations within the 3'UTR of the gene do not appear to play a major role in NS. However, recurrent observations of NS in individuals with duplications involving the PTPN11 locus suggest that increased dosage of SHP2 may have dysregulating effects on intracellular signaling.	4
Mutation allele frequency threshold does not affect prognostic analysis using next-generation sequencing in oral squamous cell carcinoma. || Adult Aged Alleles Caspase 8 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18 Female Genes, p53 High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mouth Neoplasms Mutation Prognosis Receptor, Notch1 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck || With the development of sequencing technologies, there may be some disputes on sequencing analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate different allele frequency thresholds of mutations in targeted genes on prognostic analyses using a panel of cancer associated gene exons (CAGE) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Forty-six patients were included in this study. Twelve genes were sequenced and analyzed using next-generation sequencing from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Allele frequency thresholds of 10, 5, and 3% were used for prognostic analyses. With a mean sequence depth of 3199-fold, 99% of CAGE were represented by at least 10 reads. Ninety-four non-synonymous (missense [70.2%], nonsense [11.7%], splice site [10.6%], and insertion/deletion [7.5%]) mutations were detected in 40 OSCC patients with an allele frequency threshold of 10%. TP53 (78.3%), NOTCH1 (30.4%), CASP8 (13.0%), CDKN2A (10.9%), and CDH1 (6.5%) were the most frequently mutated genes. Using allele frequency thresholds of 10, 5, and 3%, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between patients with non-synonymous mutations and wild type genotypes. TP53, NOTCH1, CASP8, CDKN2A, and CDH1 are the most frequently mutated genes in OSCC patients. The allele frequency threshold used in this study does not affect the results of clinical outcome analysis.	4
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase as a therapeutic target in melanoma. || Brain Neoplasms Cell Proliferation Chromones Enzyme Inhibitors Humans Immunoblotting Immunoenzyme Techniques Melanoma Morpholines Nevus, Pigmented Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Phosphorylation Protein Array Analysis Skin Neoplasms Tissue Array Analysis Tumor Cells, Cultured || Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K) are critical for malignant cellular processes including growth, proliferation, and survival, and are targets of drugs in clinical development. We assessed expression of PI3K in melanomas and nevi, and studied associations between PI3K pathway members and in vitro response to a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. Using Automated Quantitative Analysis, we quantified expression of p85 and p110alpha subunits in 540 nevi and 523 melanomas. We determined the IC(50) for LY294002 for 11 melanoma cell lines and, using reverse phase protein arrays, assessed the association between levels of PI3K pathway members and sensitivity to LY294002. p85 and p110alpha tend to be coexpressed (P < 0.0001); expression was higher in melanomas than nevi (P < 0.0001) for both subunits, and higher in metastatic than primary melanomas for p85 (P < 0.0001). Although phospho-Akt (pAkt) levels decreased in all cell lines treated with LY294002, sensitivity was variable. We found no association by t tests between baseline p85, p110alpha, and pAkt levels and sensitivity to LY294002, whereas pS6 Ser(235) and Ser(240) were lower in the more resistant cell lines (P = 0.01 and P = 0.004, respectively). Expression of p85 and p110alpha subunits is up-regulated in melanoma, indicating that PI3K is a good drug target. Pretreatment pS6 levels correlated with sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, whereas PI3K and pAkt did not, suggesting that full activation of the PI3K pathway is needed for sensitivity to PI3K inhibition. pS6 should be evaluated as a predictor of response in melanoma patients treated with PI3K inhibitors, as these drugs enter clinical trials.	0
A missense mutation, S349P, completely inactivates phenylalanine hydroxylase in north African Jews with phenylketonuria. || Base Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Genetic Variation Humans Israel Jews Molecular Sequence Data Morocco Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Tunisia || The majority of hyperphenylalaninemias (HPAs) result from mutations at the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The broad phenotypic variability of these conditions, ranging from phenylketonuria (PKU) to mild benign HPA, is underlain by a wide spectrum of mutations giving rise to various genotypic combinations. Mutant PAH alleles, labeled by specific polymorphic haplotypes and mutations, are becoming useful markers in human population genetics. We report here a mutant PAH allele found in Jews from Morocco and Tunisia, marked by haplotype 4 and a missense mutation, TCASer-->CCAPro, at codon 349 in exon 10 of the gene. In vitro expression of the mutation showed normal levels of mRNA with virtually no enzymatic activity or protein immunoreactivity, pointing to a highly unstable protein. A homozygote for this mutation showed the most severe ("classical") type of PKU, while compound heterozygotes showed two other types of HPA--"atypical" PKU and "high benign" HPA--illustrating the interplay between different mutations that gives rise to various HPAs.	3
SLC26A4 mutations in patients with moderate to severe hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Consanguinity DNA Mutational Analysis Epistasis, Genetic Female Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Male Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Pakistan Pedigree Phenotype Sequence Analysis, DNA Sulfate Transporters Young Adult || Mutations in SLC26A4 cause either syndromic or nonsyndromic hearing loss. We identified a link between hearing loss and DFNB4 in 3 of the 50 families participating in this study. Sequencing analysis revealed two SLC26A4 mutations, p.V239D and p.S57X, in affected members of the 3 families. These mutations have been previously reported in deaf individuals from the subcontinent, all of whom manifested profound deafness. The patients investigated in our study exhibited moderate to severe hearing loss. Our results show that inactivating SLC26A4 mutations that cause profound deafness can also be involved in the etiology of moderate to severe hearing loss. The type of mutation cannot predict the severity of the hearing loss in all cases, and there may be additional epistatic interactions that could modify the phenotype.	4
Contribution of GJB2 mutations to hearing loss in the Hazara Division of Pakistan. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Female Gene Deletion Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Mutation Pakistan Pedigree Polymorphism, Genetic Prevalence || Mutations of GJB2, which encodes connexin 26, are the most common cause of hereditary hearing loss in many human populations. This study was initiated to determine the prevalence of GJB2 mutations in individuals with hearing loss from the Hazara Division in Pakistan. We recruited 70 participants with nonsyndromic deafness segregating as an apparently recessive trait and directly sequenced the GJB2 coding region from their DNA. The homozygous mutations c.71 G → A (p.W24X), c.104 T → G (p.I35S), and c.35delG (p.G12VfsX1) were identified as the cause of hearing loss in three participants (4.28%); in populations from other areas of Pakistan, frequencies of 6-7% have been observed. The mutations c.104 T → G and c.35delG were identified in Pakistan for the first time. These results confirm the low prevalence of GJB2 mutations in Hazara and suggest that mutations in other genes may play a significant role in the etiology of deafness in this population.	4
Investigating cytokinesis failure as a strategy in cancer therapy. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cytokinesis Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mutation Neoplasms Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Effective therapeutics exploit common characteristics shared amongst cancers. As many cancers present chromosomal instability (CIN), one possible approach to treat these cancers could be to increase their CIN above a threshold that would affect their viability. Here, we investigated whether causing polyploidy by cytokinesis failure could represent a useful approach. We show that cytokinesis failure caused by depletion of Citron kinase (CIT-K) dramatically decreased cell proliferation in breast, cervical and colorectal cancer cells. CIT-K depletion activated the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway in normal, but not in cancer cells, indicating that cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to bypass this control. CIT-K depleted cancer cells died via apoptosis in a caspase 7 dependent manner and, consistent with this, p53-deficient HCT116 colon carcinoma cells failed to induce apoptosis after cytokinesis failure. However, other p53-mutated cancer cells were able to initiate apoptosis, indicating that cytokinesis failure can trigger apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism. Finally, we found that actively dividing and, in some cases, polyploid cancer cells were more susceptible to CIT-K depletion. In sum, our findings indicate that inducing cytokinesis failure could be a promising anti-cancer therapeutic approach for a wide range of cancers, especially those characterized by fast cell proliferation and polyploidy.	0
A rare polymorphism in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) gene that affects mRNA splicing. || Adult Base Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Diet Humans Hypercholesterolemia Lipids Male Mass Screening Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic RNA Splicing RNA, Messenger Receptors, LDL || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is usually caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene (LDLR) that impair clearance of LDL from the circulation. The increased risk of premature coronary heart disease associated with FH can be reduced by dietary advice and treatment with lipid-lowering drug therapy, but it is important to identify affected individuals at an early stage. Several programmes for genetic diagnosis of FH that rely on identifying nucleotide substitutions in genomic DNA have been initiated, but the validity of these is dependent on distinguishing between a silent nucleotide variant and a mutation that affects LDL-receptor function. Here we describe a single nucleotide substitution in the coding region of exon 9 of LDLR that is an apparently silent polymorphism: CGG (Arg406) to AGG (Arg). Analysis of mRNA from the patient's cells showed that the mutation introduces a new splice site that is used to the exclusion of the natural splice site and causes a deletion of 31 bp from the mRNA, predicted to introduce premature termination four codons after R406. This finding emphasizes the caution needed in genetic diagnosis of FH based on genomic DNA sequence alone.	4
Mutation-Specific Mechanisms of Hyperactivation of Noonan Syndrome SOS Molecules Detected with Single-molecule Imaging in Living Cells. ||  || Noonan syndrome (NS) is a congenital hereditary disorder associated with developmental and cardiac defects. Some patients with NS carry mutations in SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase RAS. NS mutations have been identified not only in the GEF domain, but also in various domains of SOS, suggesting that multiple mechanisms disrupt SOS function. In this study, we examined three NS mutations in different domains of SOS to clarify the abnormality in its translocation to the plasma membrane, where SOS activates RAS. The association and dissociation kinetics between SOS tagged with a fluorescent protein and the living cell surface were observed in single molecules. All three mutants showed increased affinity for the plasma membrane, inducing excessive RAS signalling. However, the mechanisms by which their affinity was increased were specific to each mutant. Conformational disorder in the resting state, increased probability of a conformational change on the plasma membrane, and an increased association rate constant with the membrane receptor are the suggested mechanisms. These different properties cause the specific phenotypes of the mutants, which should be rescuable with different therapeutic strategies. Therefore, single-molecule kinetic analyses of living cells are useful for the pathological analysis of genetic diseases.	0
Acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to treatment with gemcitabine and HER-inhibitors is accompanied by increased sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition. || Afatinib Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Crizotinib Cyclic S-Oxides DNA Mutational Analysis Deoxycytidine Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Ligands MAP Kinase Signaling System Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms Phenotype Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met Pyrazoles Pyridines Quinazolines Receptor, ErbB-2 STAT3 Transcription Factor Signal Transduction || Drug-resistance is a major contributing factor for the poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. We have shown previously that the irreversible ErbB family blocker afatinib, is more effective than the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in inhibiting the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells. The aim of this study was to develop human pancreatic cancer cell (BxPc3) variants with acquired resistance to treatment with gemcitabine, afatinib, or erlotinib, and to investigate the molecular changes that accompany the acquisition of a drug-resistant phenotype. We also investigated the therapeutic potential of various agents in the treatment of such drug-resistant variants. Three variant forms of BxPc3 cells with acquired resistance to gemcitabine (BxPc3GEM), afatinib (BxPc3AFR) or erlotinib (BxPc3OSIR) were developed following treatment with increasing doses of such drugs. The expression level, mutational and phosphorylation status of various growth factor receptors and downstream cell signaling molecules were determined by FACS, human phopsho-RTK array, and western blot analysis while the sulforhodamine B assay was used for determining the effect of various agents on the growth of such tumours. We found that all three BxPc3 variants with acquired resistance to gemcitabine (BxPc3GEM), afatinib (BxPc3AFR) or erlotinib (BxPc3OSIR) also become less sensitive to treatment with the two other agents. Acquisition of resistance to these agents was accompanied by upregulation of p-c-MET, p-STAT3, CD44, increased autocrine production of EGFR ligand amphiregulin and differential activation status of EGFR tyrosine residues as well as downregulation of total and p-SRC. Of all therapeutic interventions examined, including the addition of an anti-EGFR antibody ICR62, an anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody, and of STAT3 or c-MET inhibitors, only treatment with the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic produced a higher growth inhibitory effect in all three drug-resistant variants. In addition, treatment with a combination of afatinib with either c-MET inhibitor Crizotinib or Stattic resulted in an additive or synergistic growth inhibition in all three variants. Our results suggest that activation of STAT3 may play an important role in the acquisition of resistance to gemcitabine and HER inhibitors in pancreatic cancer and warrant further studies on the therapeutic potential of STAT3 inhibitors in such a setting.	0
Comprehensive genetic screening of KCNQ4 in a large autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss cohort: genotype-phenotype correlations and a founder mutation. ||  || The present study of KCNQ4 mutations was carried out to 1) determine the prevalence by unbiased population-based genetic screening, 2) clarify the mutation spectrum and genotype/phenotype correlations, and 3) summarize clinical characteristics. In addition, a review of the reported mutations was performed for better understanding of this deafness gene. The screening using 287 probands from unbiased Japanese autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) families identified 19 families with 7 different disease causing mutations, indicating that the frequency is 6.62% (19/287). While the majority were private mutations, one particular recurrent mutation, c.211delC, was observed in 13 unrelated families. Haplotype analysis in the vicinity of c.211delC suggests existence of a common ancestor. The majority of the patients showed all frequency, but high-frequency predominant, sensorineural hearing loss. The present study adds a new typical audiogram configuration characterized by mid-frequency predominant hearing loss caused by the p.V230E mutation. A variant at the N-terminal site (c. 211delC) showed typical ski-slope type audiogram configuration. Concerning clinical features, onset age was from 3 to 40 years old, and mostly in the teens, and hearing loss was gradually progressive. Progressive nature is a common feature of patients with KCNQ4 mutations regardless of the mutation type. In conclusion, KCNQ4 mutations are frequent among ADNSHL patients, and therefore screening of the gene and molecular confirmation of these mutations have become important in the diagnosis of these conditions.	4
Cancer risk in patients with Noonan syndrome carrying a PTPN11 mutation. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Incidence Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Netherlands Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Young Adult || Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphisms and congenital heart defects. PTPN11 mutations are the most common cause of NS. Patients with NS have a predisposition for leukemia and certain solid tumors. Data on the incidence of malignancies in NS are lacking. Our objective was to estimate the cancer risk and spectrum in patients with NS carrying a PTPN11 mutation. In addition, we have investigated whether specific PTPN11 mutations result in an increased malignancy risk. We have performed a cohort study among 297 Dutch NS patients with a PTPN11 mutation (mean age 18 years). The cancer histories were collected from the referral forms for DNA diagnostics, and by consulting the Dutch national registry of pathology and the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The reported frequencies of cancer among NS patients were compared with the expected frequencies using population-based incidence rates. In total, 12 patients with NS developed a malignancy, providing a cumulative risk for developing cancer of 23% (95% confidence interval (CI), 8-38%) up to age 55 years, which represents a 3.5-fold (95% CI, 2.0-5.9) increased risk compared with that in the general population. Hematological malignancies occurred most frequently. Two malignancies, not previously observed in NS, were found: a malignant mastocytosis and malignant epithelioid angiosarcoma. No correlation was found between specific PTPN11 mutations and cancer occurrence. In conclusion, this study provides first evidence of an increased risk of cancer in patients with NS and a PTPN11 mutation, compared with that in the general population. Our data do not warrant specific cancer surveillance.	4
Genetic anticipation in a special form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with sudden cardiac death in a family with 74 members across 5 generations. || Adolescent Adult Aged Anticipation, Genetic Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Carrier Proteins Case-Control Studies Child Death, Sudden, Cardiac Female Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle Proteins Myosin Heavy Chains Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heritable heart disease. The genetic anticipation of HCM and its associated etiology, sudden cardiac death (SCD), remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying the genetic anticipation of HCM and associated SCD.An HCM family including 5 generations and 74 members was studied. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed to diagnose HCM. The age of onset of HCM was defined as the age at first diagnosis according to hospital records. The information on SCD was confirmed by verification by ≥2 family members and a review of hospital records. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 4 HCM subjects and 1 healthy control in the family. The identified mutations were screened in all available family members and 216 unrelated healthy controls by Sanger sequencing.The median ages of onset of HCM were 63.5, 38.5, and 18.0 years in members of the second, third, and fourth generations of the family, respectively, and the differences between the generations were significant (P < 0.001). The age at SCD also decreased with each subsequent generation (P < 0.05). In particular, among the third-generation family members, SCD occurred between 30 and 40 years of age at approximately 8 AM, whereas among the fourth-generation family members, all 5 males who experienced SCD were 16 years of age and died at approximately 8 AM. The sarcomere gene mutations MYH7-A719H and MYOZ2-L169G were detected in the HCM individuals in this pedigree. Increases in the number of mutations and the frequency of multiple gene mutations were observed in the younger generations. Moreover, a structural variant was present in the HCM phenotype-positive subjects but was absent in the HCM phenotype-negative subjects.HCM may exhibit genetic anticipation, with a decreased age of onset and increased severity in successive generations. Multiple gene mutations may contribute to genetic anticipation in HCM and thus may be of prognostic value.	4
Redox Regulation of a Gain-of-Function Mutation (N308D) in SHP2 Noonan Syndrome. ||  || SHP2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2; PTPN11) is a ubiquitous multidomain, nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that plays an important role in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Noonan syndrome (NS). NS is one of the most common genetic disorders associated with congenital heart disease, and approximately half of the patients with Noonan syndrome have gain-of-function mutations in SHP2. One of the most common NS mutations is N308D. The activity of SHP2, like that of most PTPs, is reversibly inactivated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the molecular basis of this inactivation and the consequences of NS-related mutations in PTPN11 on ROS-mediated inhibition are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the mechanistic and structural details of the reversible oxidation of the NS variant SHP2N308D. We show that SHP2N308D is more sensitive to oxidation when compared with wild-type SHP2. We also show that although the SHP2N308D catalytic domain can be reactivated by dithiothreitol as effectively as the wild-type, full-length SHP2N308D is only poorly reactivated by comparison. To understand the mechanism of oxidation at a molecular level, we determined the crystal structure of oxidized SHP2N308D. The structure shows that the catalytic Cys459 residue forms a disulfide bond with Cys367, which confirms that Cys367 functions as the "backdoor" cysteine in SHP2. Together, our data suggest that the reversible oxidation of SHP2 contributes negligibly, if at all, to the symptoms associated with NS.	0
Risk assessment of the occurrence of sudden death related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Dakar. || Adult Aged Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Death, Sudden, Cardiac Echocardiography, Doppler Female Humans Male Middle Aged Prognosis Risk Assessment Risk Factors Senegal Time Factors || The aim of this study was to assess of the risk of sudden death in a population of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients in Dakar. This was a transverse study at the cardiology clinic of Aristide Le Dantec Hospital from January 2014 to June 2015. We used the European Society of Cardiology risk score to calculate this risk. The average age of patients was 53 years. Unexplained syncope was found in two patients and two others had a family history of sudden death. The septal hypertrophy average was 20.9 mm. Seven patients had left intraventricular obstruction. One patient had a high risk of sudden death, three had intermediate risk and 13 had low risk. Competitive sport was not allowed, 13 patients were under medical treatment, one had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and two had no treatment. Our study highlighted a low and intermediate risk of the occurrence of sudden death at five years. One patient had a high risk of sudden death.	4
Jerantinine A induces tumor-specific cell death through modulation of splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1). || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Cell Death Cell Line, Tumor Female Gene Knockdown Techniques Genomics Humans Indole Alkaloids MCF-7 Cells Phosphoproteins Proteome Proteomics RNA Splicing RNA Splicing Factors Spliceosomes || Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is catalyzed by a large ribonucleoprotein complex known as the spliceosome. Numerous studies have indicated that aberrant splicing patterns or mutations in spliceosome components, including the splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1), are associated with hallmark cancer phenotypes. This has led to the identification and development of small molecules with spliceosome-modulating activity as potential anticancer agents. Jerantinine A (JA) is a novel indole alkaloid which displays potent anti-proliferative activities against human cancer cell lines by inhibiting tubulin polymerization and inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. Using a combined pooled-genome wide shRNA library screen and global proteomic profiling, we showed that JA targets the spliceosome by up-regulating SF3B1 and SF3B3 protein in breast cancer cells. Notably, JA induced significant tumor-specific cell death and a significant increase in unspliced pre-mRNAs. In contrast, depletion of endogenous SF3B1 abrogated the apoptotic effects, but not the G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by JA. Further analyses showed that JA stabilizes endogenous SF3B1 protein in breast cancer cells and induced dissociation of the protein from the nucleosome complex. Together, these results demonstrate that JA exerts its antitumor activity by targeting SF3B1 and SF3B3 in addition to its reported targeting of tubulin polymerization.	0
Nonsyndromic 35 delG mutation of the connexin 26 gene associated with deafness in syndromic children: two case reports. || Child Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 Connexins Craniofacial Abnormalities Down Syndrome Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Phenotype Syndrome || Several genetic diseases, such as velocardiofacial syndrome Del(22q11) and Down syndrome, are associated with hearing impairment. Case reports. The authors reported two cases of hearing-impaired children, one with Del (22q11) and one with Down syndrome, both with bilateral nonevolutive profound sensorineural deafness. Because of unusual features of their deafness and familial history, genetic evaluation was proposed. A homozygous 35delG mutation on the Connexin 26 gene was found in both children (DFNB1 phenotype). A review of the reported otological features of Del (22q11) and Down syndrome showed that sensorineural deafness is rare and seldom profound. The authors found no evidence for a genetic link between Del(22q11) or Down syndrome and 35delG mutation on the Connexin 26 gene. The case reports reveal a coincidental association between DFNB1 and a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. The clinician must be aware of this type of association to manage genetic counseling, appropriate otological care, and suitable treatment.	4
miR-27a and miR-27a* contribute to metastatic properties of osteosarcoma cells. || CBFA2T3 metastasis miR-27a osteosarcoma star miRNA || Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in adolescents and young adults. The essential mechanisms underlying osteosarcomagenesis and progression continue to be obscure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have far-reaching effects on the cellular biology of development and cancer. We recently reported that unique miRNA signatures associate with the pathogenesis and progression of OS. Of particular interest, we found that higher expression of miR-27a is associated with clinical metastatic disease. We report here that overexpression of miR-27a/miR-27a*, a microRNA pair derived from a single precursor, promotes pulmonary OS metastases formation. By contrast, sequestering miR-27a/miR-27a* by sponge technology suppressed OS cells invasion and metastases formation. miR-27a/miR-27a* directly repressed CBFA2T3 expression among other target genes. We demonstrated that CBFA2T3 is downregulated in majority of OS samples and its over expression significantly attenuated OS metastatic process mediated by miR-27a/miR-27a* underscoring CBFA2T3 functions as a tumor suppressor in OS. These findings establish that miR-27a/miR-27a* pair plays a significant role in OS metastasis and proposes it as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in managing OS metastases.	0
Application of a New Genetic Deafness Microarray for Detecting Mutations in the Deaf in China. || Adolescent Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child China Connexin 26 Connexins Databases, Genetic Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Membrane Transport Proteins Microarray Analysis Mutation Sequence Analysis, DNA Sulfate Transporters || The aim of this study was to evaluate the GoldenGate microarray as a diagnostic tool and to elucidate the contribution of the genes on this array to the development of both nonsyndromic and syndromic sensorineural hearing loss in China. We developed a microarray to detect 240 mutations underlying syndromic and nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The microarray was then used for analysis of 382 patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (including 15 patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome), 21 patients with Waardenburg syndrome, and 60 unrelated controls. Subsequently, we analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of this new approach after Sanger sequencing-based verification, and also determined the contribution of the genes on this array to the development of distinct hearing disorders. The sensitivity and specificity of the microarray chip were 98.73% and 98.34%, respectively. Genetic defects were identified in 61.26% of the patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, and 9 causative genes were identified. The molecular etiology was confirmed in 19.05% and 46.67% of the patients with Waardenburg syndrome and enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome, respectively. Our new mutation-based microarray comprises an accurate and comprehensive genetic tool for the detection of sensorineural hearing loss. This microarray-based detection method could serve as a first-pass screening (before next-generation-sequencing screening) for deafness-causing mutations in China.	1
Mutations of the p53 gene in adult T-cell leukemia. || Adult Aged Base Sequence CD4 Antigens Codon DNA, Neoplasm Female Genes, p53 Humans Leukemia, T-Cell Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction || The p53 tumor suppressor gene was examined by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from fresh tumor cells of 10 patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Samples included nine patients with acute or lymphomatous ATL, and one patient in whom samples were examined in both his acute and chronic stages of ATL. Four missense mutations and one silent point mutation in the coding region of the p53 gene were found in cells from five patients with either acute or lymphomatous ATL. The missense mutations were homozygous and occurred in evolutionarily highly conserved regions of p53. One patient had no p53 mutation in his leukemic cells during chronic phase of ATL, but had a homozygous point mutation at codon 273 (Arg to His) when he progressed to acute ATL. In summary, we show that p53 is frequently mutated in the acute phase of ATL and one informative case suggests that p53 mutations may be associated with the transition from chronic to acute ATL.	4
Multifunctional Compounds for Activation of the p53-Y220C Mutant in Cancer. || Binding Sites Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Coordination Complexes Drug Design Humans Ligands Microscopy, Fluorescence Molecular Conformation Molecular Docking Simulation Neoplasms Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Structure, Tertiary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc || The p53 protein plays a major role in cancer prevention, and over 50 % of cancer diagnoses can be attributed to p53 malfunction. The common p53 mutation Y220C causes local protein unfolding, aggregation, and can result in a loss of Zn in the DNA-binding domain. Structural analysis has shown that this mutant creates a surface site that can be stabilized using small molecules, and herein a multifunctional approach to restore function to p53-Y220C is reported. A series of compounds has been designed that contain iodinated phenols aimed for interaction and stabilization of the p53-Y220C surface cavity, and Zn-binding fragments for metallochaperone activity. Their Zn-binding affinity was characterized using spectroscopic methods and demonstrate the ability of compounds L4 and L5 to increase intracellular levels of Zn2+ in a p53-Y220C-mutant cell line. The in vitro cytotoxicity of our compounds was initially screened by the National Cancer Institute (NCI-60), followed by testing in three stomach cancer cell lines with varying p53 status', including AGS (WTp53), MKN1 (V143A), and NUGC3 (Y220C). Our most promising ligand, L5, is nearly 3-fold more cytotoxic than cisplatin in a large number of cell lines. The impressive cytotoxicity of L5 is further maintained in a NUGC3 3D spheroid model. L5 also induces Y220C-specific apoptosis in a cleaved caspase-3 assay, reduces levels of unfolded mutant p53, and recovers p53 transcriptional function in the NUGC3 cell line. These results show that these multifunctional scaffolds have the potential to restore wild-type function in mutant p53-Y220C.	0
Gene correction in patient-specific iPSCs for therapy development and disease modeling. || Anemia, Sickle Cell Cystic Fibrosis Gene Editing Genetic Therapy Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Models, Biological Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne Regenerative Medicine Severe Combined Immunodeficiency alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency beta-Thalassemia || The discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent and the development of engineered endonucleases for enhancing genome editing are two of the most exciting and impactful technology advances in modern medicine and science. Human pluripotent stem cells have the potential to establish new model systems for studying human developmental biology and disease mechanisms. Gene correction in patient-specific iPSCs can also provide a novel source for autologous cell therapy. Although historically challenging, precise genome editing in human iPSCs is becoming more feasible with the development of new genome-editing tools, including ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR. iPSCs derived from patients of a variety of diseases have been edited to correct disease-associated mutations and to generate isogenic cell lines. After directed differentiation, many of the corrected iPSCs showed restored functionality and demonstrated their potential in cell replacement therapy. Genome-wide analyses of gene-corrected iPSCs have collectively demonstrated a high fidelity of the engineered endonucleases. Remaining challenges in clinical translation of these technologies include maintaining genome integrity of the iPSC clones and the differentiated cells. Given the rapid advances in genome-editing technologies, gene correction is no longer the bottleneck in developing iPSC-based gene and cell therapies; generating functional and transplantable cell types from iPSCs remains the biggest challenge needing to be addressed by the research field.	0
Myofilament Calcium Sensitivity: Role in Regulation of In vivo Cardiac Contraction and Relaxation. ||  || Myofilament calcium sensitivity is an often-used indicator of cardiac muscle function, often assessed in disease states such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). While assessment of calcium sensitivity provides important insights into the mechanical force-generating capability of a muscle at steady-state, the dynamic behavior of the muscle cannot be sufficiently assessed with a force-pCa curve alone. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the force-pCa curve depends on the ratio of the apparent calcium association rate constant (kon) and apparent calcium dissociation rate constant (koff) of calcium on TnC and as a stand-alone parameter cannot provide an accurate description of the dynamic contraction and relaxation behavior without the additional quantification of kon or koff, or actually measuring dynamic twitch kinetic parameters in an intact muscle. In this review, we examine the effect of length, frequency, and beta-adrenergic stimulation on myofilament calcium sensitivity and dynamic contraction in the myocardium, the effect of membrane permeabilization/mechanical- or chemical skinning on calcium sensitivity, and the dynamic consequences of various myofilament protein mutations with potential implications in contractile and relaxation behavior.	4
Coincidence of mutations in different connexin genes in Hungarian patients. ||  || Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of hereditary prelingual sensorineural hearing impairment in Europe. Several studies indicate that different members of the connexin protein family interact to form gap junctions in the inner ear. Mutations in different connexin genes may accumulate and, consequently lead to hearing impairment. Therefore, we screened 47 Hungarian GJB2- heterozygous (one mutation in coding exon of the GJB2 gene) patients with hearing impairment for DNA changes in two further connexin genes (GJB6 and GJB3) and in the 5' non-coding region of GJB2 including the splice sites. Eleven out of 47 GJB2-heterozygous patients analyzed carried the splice site mutation -3170G>A in the 5'UTR region of GJB2. One out of these 11 patients showed homozygous -3170G>A genotype in combination with p.R127H. Next to the GJB2 mutations we noted 2 cases of deletion in GJB6 [Delta(GJB6-D13S1830)] and 3 (2 new and 1 described) base substitutions in GJB3 [c.357C>T, c.798C>T and c.94C>T (p.R32W)] which are unlikely disease-causing. Our results suggest the importance of routine screening for the rather frequent -3170G>A mutation (in addition to c.35delG) in patients with hearing impairment.	4
Capsaicin mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human colon cancer cells via stabilizing and activating p53. || Apoptosis Capsaicin Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Proliferation Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor HCT116 Cells Humans Phytotherapy Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Sensory System Agents Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Capsaicin is the major pungent ingredient in red peppers which is world widely consumed. Except its potent pain relieving efficacy as reported, capsaicin also exerted its antitumor activity in several tumor models. Here, we reported that capsaicin had a profound anti-proliferative effect on human colon cancer cells via inducing cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, which was associated with an increase of p21, Bax and cleaved PARP. The underlying mechanism of capsaicin's antitumor potency was mainly attributed to the stabilization and activation of p53. Capsaicin substantially prolonged the half-life of p53 and significantly elevated the transcriptional activity of p53. Through suppressing the interaction between p53 and MDM2, MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination was remarkably decreased after capsaicin treatment, which resulted in the stabilization and accumulation of p53. The results of p53-shRNA experiment further demonstrated that p53 knockdown severely impaired the sensitivity of tested cells to capsaicin, G0/G1 phase arrest and the apoptosis induced by capsaicin in p53-knockdown cells was also dramatically decreased, implicating the important role of p53 played in capsaicin's antitumor activity. In summary, our data suggested that capsaicin, or a related analogue, may have a role in the management of human colon cancer.	0
Mutational spectrum in Usher syndrome type II. || Case-Control Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Extracellular Matrix Proteins Gene Frequency Hearing Loss Humans Mutation North America Polymorphism, Genetic Retinitis Pigmentosa Syndrome United Kingdom || Usher syndrome type II is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by moderate to severe hearing impairment and progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP). We carried out a mutation screening of the USH2A gene in 88 probands with Usher syndrome type II to determine the frequency of USH2A mutations as a cause for USH2. Six mutations, including 2299delG, 921-922insCAGC, R334W, N346H, R626X, and N357T were identified, with 2299delG mutation being the most frequent (16.5% of alleles), accounting for 77.5% of the pathologic alleles. Thirty-five percent (31/88) of the probands had a USH2A mutation. Nine of them carried two pathogenic mutations: six cases were homozygotes and three were compound heterozygotes. Twenty-two probands (25%) were found to carry only single USH2A mutations. One new missense mutation (N357T) occuring within the laminin N-terminal (type VI) domain of usherin was identified. Eight polymorphisms were found, five of which are novel. Our data support the view that the 2299delG is the most common mutation in USH2A.	1
p53 coordinates base excision repair to prevent genomic instability. || Cells, Cultured DNA Breaks, Single-Stranded DNA Repair DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase Down-Regulation Genomic Instability Humans Sp1 Transcription Factor Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || DNA constantly undergoes chemical modification due to endogenous and exogenous mutagens. The DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway is the frontline mechanism handling the majority of these lesions, and primarily involves a DNA incision and subsequent resealing step. It is imperative that these processes are extremely well-coordinated as unrepaired DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) can be converted to DNA double strand breaks during replication thus triggering genomic instability. However, the mechanism(s) governing the BER process are poorly understood. Here we show that accumulation of unrepaired SSBs triggers a p53/Sp1-dependent downregulation of APE1, the endonuclease responsible for the DNA incision during BER. Importantly, we demonstrate that impaired p53 function, a characteristic of many cancers, leads to a failure of the BER coordination mechanism, overexpression of APE1, accumulation of DNA strand breaks and results in genomic instability. Our data provide evidence for a previously unrecognized mechanism for coordination of BER by p53, and its dysfunction in p53-inactivated cells.	0
Significant phenotypic variability of Muenke syndrome in identical twins. || Abnormalities, Drug-Induced Abnormalities, Multiple Adult Amino Acid Sequence Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity Child Craniosynostoses Diseases in Twins Female Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Nortriptyline Phenotype Pregnancy Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Syndrome Twins, Monozygotic || Muenke syndrome (MS), also known as Muenke nonsyndromic coronal craniosynostosis, is an autosomal dominant condition which can be distinguished from the more common forms of acrocephalosyndactyly but presents a significant variable phenotype. We report on a set of identical twins with a de novo C749G mutation in the FGFR3 gene codon 250 after a pregnancy complicated by prenatal exposure to Nortriptyline. These patients illustrate the variable expressivity of MS in association with an identical gene mutation.	4
p53 regulates the mevalonate pathway in human glioblastoma multiforme. || Brain Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cholesterol Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glioblastoma Humans Metabolic Networks and Pathways Mevalonic Acid Promoter Regions, Genetic Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is an important metabolic pathway implicated in multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. In this study, we provided evidence that p53 induces the expression of a group of enzymes of the MVA pathway including 3'-hydroxy-3'-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, MVA kinase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase and farnesyl diphosphate farnesyl transferase 1, in the human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U343 cells, and in normal human astrocytes, NHAs. Genetic and pharmacologic perturbation of p53 directly influences the expression of these genes. Furthermore, p53 is recruited to the gene promoters in designated p53-responsive elements, thereby increasing their transcription. Such effect was abolished by site-directed mutagenesis in the p53-responsive element of promoter of the genes. These findings highlight another aspect of p53 functions unrelated to tumor suppression and suggest p53 as a novel regulator of the MVA pathway providing insight into the role of this pathway in cancer progression.	0
A familial case of Muenke syndrome. Diverse expressivity of the FGFR3 Pro252Arg mutation--case report and review of the literature. || Adult Amino Acid Substitution Arginine Craniosynostoses Family Female Greece Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation, Missense Pedigree Phenotype Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis Proline Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 || Muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3)-associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990 s. Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized mainly by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing impairment and intellectual disability. The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c.749C > G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p.Pro250Arg of the protein product. Despite the fact that the mutation rate at this nucleotide is one of the most frequently described in human genome, few Muenke familial case reports are published in current literature. We describe individuals among three generations of a Greek family who are carriers of the same mutation. Medical record and physical examination of family members present a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. In particular, a 38-year-old woman and her father appear milder clinical findings regarding craniofacial characteristics compared to her uncle and newborn female child. This familial case illustrates the variable expressivity of Muenke syndrome in association with an identical gene mutation.	4
Small Molecule Inhibitor of CBFβ-RUNX Binding for RUNX Transcription Factor Driven Cancers. || Allosteric Regulation Antineoplastic Agents Cell Differentiation Cell Line, Tumor Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits Core Binding Factor beta Subunit Drug Discovery Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockdown Techniques Humans Leukemia Models, Molecular Molecular Conformation Mutation Neoplasms Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Multimerization Signal Transduction Structure-Activity Relationship || Transcription factors have traditionally been viewed with skepticism as viable drug targets, but they offer the potential for completely novel mechanisms of action that could more effectively address the stem cell like properties, such as self-renewal and chemo-resistance, that lead to the failure of traditional chemotherapy approaches. Core binding factor is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of one of 3 RUNX proteins (RUNX1-3) and a CBFβ binding partner. CBFβ enhances DNA binding of RUNX subunits by relieving auto-inhibition. Both RUNX1 and CBFβ are frequently mutated in human leukemia. More recently, RUNX proteins have been shown to be key players in epithelial cancers, suggesting the targeting of this pathway could have broad utility. In order to test this, we developed small molecules which bind to CBFβ and inhibit its binding to RUNX. Treatment with these inhibitors reduces binding of RUNX1 to target genes, alters the expression of RUNX1 target genes, and impacts cell survival and differentiation. These inhibitors show efficacy against leukemia cells as well as basal-like (triple-negative) breast cancer cells. These inhibitors provide effective tools to probe the utility of targeting RUNX transcription factor function in other cancers.	0
Mutations in epigenetic regulators are involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. || acute lymphoblastic leukemia allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation epigenetic regulators mutation relapse || Although steady improvements to chemotherapeutic treatments has helped cure 80% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, chemotherapy has proven to be less effective in treating the majority of adult patients, leaving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) as the primary adult treatment option. Nevertheless relapse are the leading cause of death following allo-HSCT. The genetic pathogenesis of relapse following allo-HSCT in Philadelphia chromosome- negative ALL (Ph- ALL) remains unexplored. We performed longitudinal whole-exome sequencing analysis in three adult patients with Ph- B-cell ALL (Ph- B-ALL) on samples collected from diagnosis to relapse after allo-HSCT. Based on these data, we performed target gene sequencing on 23 selected genes in 58 adult patients undergoing allo-HSCT with Ph- B-ALL. Our results revealed a significant enrichment of mutations in epigenetic regulators from relapsed samples, with recurrent somatic mutations in SETD2, CREBBP, KDM6A and NR3C1. The relapsed samples were also enriched in signaling factor mutations, including KRAS, PTPN21, MYC and USP54. Furthermore, we are the first to reveal the clonal evolution patterns during leukemia relapse after allo-HSCT. Cells present in relapsed specimens were genetically related to the diagnosed tumor, these cells therefore arose from either an existing subclone that was not eradicated by allo-HSCT therapy, or from the same progenitor that acquired new mutations. In some cases, however, it is possible that leukemia recurrence following allo-HSCT could result from a secondary malignancy with a distinct set of mutations. We identified novel genetic causes of leukemia relapse after allo-HSCT using the largest generated data set to date from adult patients with Ph- B-ALL.	4
Prevalence of mutations located at the dfnb1 locus in a population of cochlear implanted children in eastern Romania. || Child Child, Preschool Cochlear Implantation Cochlear Implants Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Counseling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Prevalence Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Romania || Hearing loss is one of the major public health problems, with a genetic etiology in more than 60% of cases. Connexin 26 and connexin 30 mutations are the most prevalent causes of deafness. The aim of this study is to characterize and to establish the prevalence of the GJB2 and GJB6 gene mutations in a population of cochlear implanted recipients from Eastern Romania, this being the first report of this type in our country. We present a retrospective study that enrolled 45 Caucasian cochlear implanted patients with non-syndromic sensorineural severe to profound, congenital or progressive with early-onset idiopathic hearing loss. We performed sequential analysis of exon 1 and the coding exon 2 of the GJB2 gene including also the splice sites and analysis of the deletions del(GJB6-D13S1830), del(GJB6-D13S1854) and del(chr13:19,837,343-19,968,698). The genetic analysis of the GJB2 gene identified connexin 26 mutations in 22 patients out of 45 (12 homozygous for c.35delG, 6 compound heterozygous and 4 with mutations only on one allele). We found 6 different mutations, the most prevalent being c.35delG - found on 32 alleles, followed by p.W24* - found on 2 alleles. We did not identify the deletions del(GJB6-D13S1830), del(GJB6-D13S1854) and del(chr13:19,837,343-19,968,698). Although the most prevalent mutation was c.35delG (80% from all types of mutations), unexpectedly we identified 5 more different mutations. The presence of 6 different mutations on the GJB2 gene has implications in hearing screening programs development in our region and in genetic counseling.	4
The UCL low-density lipoprotein receptor gene variant database: pathogenicity update. || Databases, Genetic Genetic Variation Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Mutation, Missense Phenotype Promoter Regions, Genetic Receptors, LDL || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (OMIM 143890) is most frequently caused by variations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Predicting whether novel variants are pathogenic may not be straightforward, especially for missense and synonymous variants. In 2013, the Association of Clinical Genetic Scientists published guidelines for the classification of variants, with categories 1 and 2 representing clearly not or unlikely pathogenic, respectively, 3 representing variants of unknown significance (VUS), and 4 and 5 representing likely to be or clearly pathogenic, respectively. Here, we update the University College London (UCL)LDLR variant database according to these guidelines. PubMed searches and alerts were used to identify novel LDLR variants for inclusion in the database. Standardin silico tools were used to predict potential pathogenicity. Variants were designated as class 4/5 only when the predictions from the different programs were concordant and as class 3 when predictions were discordant. The updated database (http://www.lovd.nl/LDLR) now includes 2925 curated variants, representing 1707 independent events. All 129 nonsense variants, 337 small frame-shifting and 117/118 large rearrangements were classified as 4 or 5. Of the 795 missense variants, 115 were in classes 1 and 2, 605 in class 4 and 75 in class 3. 111/181 intronic variants, 4/34 synonymous variants and 14/37 promoter variants were assigned to classes 4 or 5. Overall, 112 (7%) of reported variants were class 3. This study updates the LDLR variant database and identifies a number of reported VUS where additional family andin vitro studies will be required to confirm or refute their pathogenicity.	4
Diagnostic Yield of Clinical Tumor and Germline Whole-Exome Sequencing for Children With Solid Tumors. ||  || Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has the potential to reveal tumor and germline mutations of clinical relevance, but the diagnostic yield for pediatric patients with solid tumors is unknown. To characterize the diagnostic yield of combined tumor and germline WES for children with solid tumors. Unselected children with newly diagnosed and previously untreated central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS solid tumors were prospectively enrolled in the BASIC3 study at a large academic children's hospital during a 23-month period from August 2012 through June 2014. Blood and tumor samples underwent WES in a certified clinical laboratory with genetic results categorized on the basis of perceived clinical relevance and entered in the electronic health record. Clinical categorization of somatic mutations; frequencies of deleterious germline mutations related to patient phenotype and incidental medically-actionable mutations. Of the first 150 participants (80 boys and 70 girls, mean age, 7.4 years), tumor samples adequate for WES were available from 121 patients (81%). Somatic mutations of established clinical utility (category I) were reported in 4 (3%) of 121 patients, with mutations of potential utility (category II) detected in an additional 29 (24%) of 121 patients. CTNNB1 was the gene most frequently mutated, with recurrent mutations in KIT, TSC2, and MAPK pathway genes (BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS) also identified. Mutations in consensus cancer genes (category III) were found in an additional 24 (20%) of 121 tumors. Fewer than half of somatic mutations identified were in genes known to be recurrently mutated in the tumor type tested. Diagnostic germline findings related to patient phenotype were discovered in 15 (10%) of 150 cases: 13 pathogenic or likely pathogenic dominant mutations in adult and pediatric cancer susceptibility genes (including 2 each in TP53, VHL, and BRCA1), 1 recessive liver disorder with hepatocellular carcinoma (TJP2), and 1 renal diagnosis (CLCN5). Incidental findings were reported in 8 (5%) of 150 patients. Most patients harbored germline uncertain variants in cancer genes (98%), pharmacogenetic variants (89%), and recessive carrier mutations (85%). Tumor and germline WES revealed mutations in a broad spectrum of genes previously implicated in both adult and pediatric cancers. Combined reporting of tumor and germline WES identified diagnostic and/or potentially actionable findings in nearly 40% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with solid tumors.	4
[Mutation analysis of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in 55 patients with phenylketonuria from Hebei province]. ||  || To identify the pathogenic mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) from Hebei Province. Genomic DNA was extracted from 55 unrelated PKU patients from September 2007 to July 2009. All PAH exons and exon-intron junctions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplifications (MLPA) was performed to detect the deletions or duplications of PAH. Gap-PCR was used to determine the breakpoints of large deletions. Among them, 108 mutant alleles (98.2%) were found. All PAH exons with the exceptions of exons 9 and 13 were affected. A total of 41 different mutations were detected, including missense (n = 24), nonsense (n = 7), splicing (n = 7), small deletion (n = 1) and large deletion (n = 2). Among them, 4 missense mutations (p.Pro147Leu, p.Gly289Arg, p.Phe392Ser, p.Ile421Thr) and 2 large deletions (-4163_-406del and -1932_+3402del) were novel. The most common mutations were p.Arg243Gln (12.7%), c.611A > G (11.8%) and c.1197A > T (9.1%). The mutations of PKU patients with from Hebei Province are scattered throughout the PAH gene. Most of them are of single nucleotide substitutions, but large deletions are not rare.	3
Targeting the p53 pathway. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Neoplasms Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || This article summarizes data on translational studies to target the p53 pathway in cancer. It describes the functions of the p53 and Mdm-2 signaling pathways, and discusses current therapeutic approaches to target p53 pathways, including reactivation of p53. In addition, direct interaction and colocalization of the p53 and focal adhesion kinase proteins in cancer cells have been demonstrated, and different approaches to target this interaction are reviewed. This is a broad review of p53 function as it relates to the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of cancers.	0
Racial Disparities in the Molecular Landscape of Cancer. || African Americans Aged Cohort Studies Continental Population Groups DNA Mutational Analysis European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genetic Heterogeneity Health Status Disparities High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Neoplasms United States || African Americans (AA) have the highest incidence and mortality of any racial/ethnic group in the US for most cancer types. Heterogeneity in the molecular biology of cancer, as a contributing factor to this disparity, is poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we explored the molecular landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high-grade glioma (HGG) from 271 AA and 636 Caucasian (CC) cases. DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors was sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Additionally, we evaluated protein expression using immunohistochemistry. The Exome Aggregation Consortium Database was evaluated for known ethnicity associations. Considering only pathogenic or presumed pathogenic mutations, as determined by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, and using Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg corrections for multiple comparisons, we found that CRC tumors from AA patients harbored significantly more mutations of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) than those from CC patients. CRC tumors in AA patients also appeared to harbor more mutations of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1/MEK1), MPL proto-oncogene (MPL), thrombo-poietin receptor, and neurofibromin 1 (NF1) than those from CC patients. In contrast, CRCs from AA patients were likely to carry fewer mutations of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), as well as of proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF), including the V600E variant, than those from CC patients. Rates of immunohistochemical positivity for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) tended to be higher in CRCs from AA patients than in CC patients. In NSCLC adenocarcinoma, BRAF variants appeared to be more frequent in the AA than in the CC cohort, whereas in squamous cell lung carcinoma, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression tended to be lower in the AA than in CC group. Moreover, HGG tumors from AA patients showed a trend toward harboring more mutations of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 11 (PTPN11), than HGG tumors from the CC cohort. In contrast, mutations of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) appeared to be higher in HGG tumors in CC patients than in their AA counterparts. Our data revealed significant differences and trends in molecular signatures of the three cancer types in AA and CC cohorts. These findings imply that there may be differences in carcinogenesis between AA and CC patients and that race may be a factor that should be considered regarding cancer incidence and outcome.	4
Primary structure and processing of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase; homology with the intestinal sucrase-isomaltase complex. ||  || Lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) is essential for degradation of glycogen in lysosomes. Enzyme deficiency results in glycogenosis type II. The amino acid sequence of the entire enzyme was derived from the nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNA. The cDNA comprises 3636 nt, and hybridizes with a messenger RNA of approximately 3.6 kb, which is absent in fibroblasts of two patients with glycogenosis type II. The encoded protein has a molecular mass of 104.645 kd and starts with a signal peptide. Sites of proteolytic processing are established by identification of N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 110-kd precursor, and the 76-kd and 70-kd mature forms of the enzyme encoded by the cDNA. Interestingly, both amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal processing occurs. Sites of sugar-chain attachment are proposed. A remarkable homology is observed between this soluble lysosomal alpha-glucosidase and the membrane-bound intestinal brush border sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex. It is proposed that these enzymes are derived from the same ancestral gene. Around the putative active site of sucrase and isomaltase, 10 out of 13 amino acids are identical to the corresponding amino acids of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. This strongly suggests that the aspartic acid residue at this position is essential for catalytic function of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase.	1
CRISPR-Barcoding for Intratumor Genetic Heterogeneity Modeling and Functional Analysis of Oncogenic Driver Mutations. || Animals Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Biomarkers, Tumor CRISPR-Cas Systems Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Lineage Clone Cells DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Gene Editing Genetic Heterogeneity Genetic Predisposition to Disease HCT116 Cells HEK293 Cells High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms MCF-7 Cells Male Mice, SCID Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Oncogenes Phenotype Point Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Time Factors Tumor Microenvironment Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Intratumor genetic heterogeneity underlies the ability of tumors to evolve and adapt to different environmental conditions. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and specific DNA barcodes, we devised a strategy to recapitulate and trace the emergence of subpopulations of cancer cells containing a mutation of interest. We used this approach to model different mechanisms of lung cancer cell resistance to EGFR inhibitors and to assess effects of combined drug therapies. By overcoming intrinsic limitations of current approaches, CRISPR-barcoding also enables investigation of most types of genetic modifications, including repair of oncogenic driver mutations. Finally, we used highly complex barcodes inserted at a specific genome location as a means of simultaneously tracing the fates of many thousands of genetically labeled cancer cells. CRISPR-barcoding is a straightforward and highly flexible method that should greatly facilitate the functional investigation of specific mutations, in a context that closely mimics the complexity of cancer.	0
Rapid targeted mutational analysis of human tumours: a clinical platform to guide personalized cancer medicine. || Clinical Laboratory Techniques DNA Mutational Analysis Genotype Humans Mutation Neoplasms Polymerase Chain Reaction Precision Medicine || Targeted cancer therapy requires the rapid and accurate identification of genetic abnormalities predictive of therapeutic response. We sought to develop a high-throughput genotyping platform that would allow prospective patient selection to the best available therapies, and that could readily and inexpensively be adopted by most clinical laboratories. We developed a highly sensitive multiplexed clinical assay that performs very well with nucleic acid derived from formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) tissue, and tests for 120 previously described mutations in 13 cancer genes. Genetic profiling of 250 primary tumours was consistent with the documented oncogene mutational spectrum and identified rare events in some cancer types. The assay is currently being used for clinical testing of tumour samples and contributing to cancer patient management. This work therefore establishes a platform for real-time targeted genotyping that can be widely adopted. We expect that efforts like this one will play an increasingly important role in cancer management.	4
C-MYC overexpression is required for continuous suppression of oncogene-induced senescence in melanoma cells. || Cell Line, Tumor Cellular Senescence Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16 Disease Progression Gene Deletion Gene Expression Humans Melanocytes Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Neoplasm Metastasis Phenotype Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 ras Proteins || Malignant melanomas often harbor activating mutations in BRAF (V600E) or, less frequently, in NRAS (Q61R). Intriguingly, the same mutations have been detected at higher incidences in benign nevi, which are largely composed of senescent melanocytes. Overexpression of BRAF(V600E) or NRAS(Q61R) in human melanocytes in vitro has been shown to induce senescence, although via different mechanisms. How oncogene-induced senescence is overcome during melanoma progression remains unclear. Here, we report that in the majority of analysed BRAF(V600E)- or NRAS(Q61R)-expressing melanoma cells, C-MYC depletion induced different yet overlapping sets of senescence phenotypes that are characteristic of normal melanocytes undergoing senescence due to overexpression of BRAF(V600E) or NRAS(Q61R), respectively. These senescence phenotypes were p16(INK4A)- or p53-independent, however, several of them were suppressed by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BRAF(V600E) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways, including rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTOR-raptor in NRAS(Q61R)-expressing melanoma cells. Reciprocally, overexpression of C-MYC in normal melanocytes suppressed BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence more efficiently than NRAS(Q61R)-induced senescence, which agrees with the generally higher rates of activating mutations in BRAF than NRAS gene in human cutaneous melanomas. Our data suggest that one of the major functions of C-MYC overexpression in melanoma progression is to continuous suppress BRAF(V600E)- or NRAS(Q61R)-dependent senescence programs.	0
Is there a relationship between U-shaped audiograms and mutations in connexin 26? || Adolescent Adult Audiometry, Pure-Tone Connexin 26 Connexins Female Hearing Disorders Humans Male Middle Aged Point Mutation Severity of Illness Index || The knowledge about gene mutations causing permanent hearing impairment (HI) is rapidly increasing, offering clinicians the possibility of analysing different gene mutations in relation to various phenotypes. This study examines a possible relationship between U-shaped audiograms and mutations in the GJB2-gene, coding for Connexin 26 (Cx 26). Thirty-eight subjects at a median age of 42 years, range 18-60 years with symmetric U-shaped audiograms classified as sensorineural were included in the genetic investigation. The gender distribution was 13 males and 25 females. No subjects had any indication of syndromic HI, and any possible exogenous factor that might cause HI was excluded. Three subjects had self-reported prelingual HI and 34 subjects had self-reported postlingual HI. Thirty-five subjects had one or more family members with HI. In 19 subjects the entire Cx 26 gene was examined, whereas 19 subjects were investigated for the 35delG mutation only. One female with mild HI and postlingual onset of the HI was heterogeneous for the L9OP-mutation in the Cx 26 gene. In all other subjects no mutations in the Cx 26 gene could be identified. Mutations of the Cx 26 gene are very rare among subjects exhibiting a U-shaped phenotype of the audiogram. However the majority of the investigated subjects (35/38) had a family history of HI and it seems therefore reasonable to ascribe U-shaped hearing deficit to genetic factors which has to be searched for in alternative gene mutations.	4
Zn(II)-curc targets p53 in thyroid cancer cells. || Antineoplastic Agents Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Curcumin Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Thyroid Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc Compounds || TP53 mutation is a common event in many cancers, including thyroid carcinoma. Defective p53 activity promotes cancer resistance to therapies and a more malignant phenotype, acquiring oncogenic functions. Rescuing the function of mutant p53 (mutp53) protein is an attractive anticancer therapeutic strategy. Zn(II)-curc is a novel small molecule that has been shown to target mutp53 protein in several cancer cells, but its effect in thyroid cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether Zn(II)-curc could affect p53 in thyroid cancer cells with both p53 mutation (R273H) and wild-type p53. Zn(II)-curc induced mutp53H273 downregulation and reactivation of wild-type functions, such as binding to canonical target promoters and target gene transactivation. This latter effect was similar to that induced by PRIMA-1. In addition, Zn(II)-curc triggered p53 target gene expression in wild-type p53-carrying cells. In combination treatments, Zn(II)-curc enhanced the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs, in both mutant and wild-type-carrying cancer cells. Taken together, our data indicate that Zn(II)-curc promotes the reactivation of p53 in thyroid cancer cells, providing in vitro evidence for a potential therapeutic approach in thyroid cancers.	0
Dovitinib synergizes with oxaliplatin in suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells regardless of RAS-RAF mutation status. || Animals Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Apoptosis Benzimidazoles Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Colorectal Neoplasms Drug Synergism Female Humans Immunohistochemistry Mice Mice, Nude Mutation Oncogene Protein p21(ras) Organoplatinum Compounds Oxaliplatin Quinolones Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays raf Kinases || Cancer is the result of a multistep process of genomic alterations, including mutations in key regulatory proteins that result in loss of balanced gene expression and subsequent malignant transformation. Throughout the various stages of colorectal carcinoma (CRC), complex genetic alterations occur, of which over-expression of growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derive growth factor and their corresponding receptor tyrosine kinases, have been shown to correlate with invasiveness, tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, recurrence, and poor prognosis of colorectal cancer. To evaluate the therapeutic effect, we combined Dovitinib, an orally bioavailable, potent inhibitor of class III-V receptor tyrosine kinases with chemotherapeutic drug, oxaliplatin in preclinical models of colon cancer. Human colon cancer cells with different RAS-RAF mutation status (HCT-116, HT-29, SW-480, CaCO2 and LS174T) were treated with a combination of Dovitinib and Oxaliplatin at low dosage followed by assays to investigate the effect of the combination on cell proliferation, cell migration, cell apoptosis and signaling pathways involved in molecular mechanism of drug(s). The antitumor effects of either of the drugs were compared to the combination using human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 xenograft model. Treated vs untreated tumor sections were also compared for proliferation and angiogenesis markers by immunohistochemistry. The combination of dovitinib and oxaliplatin showed higher in vitro cytotoxicity in colon cell lines irrespective of their RAS-RAF status as compared to either of the drugs alone. Simultaneous inhibition of MAP kinase and AKT pathways and induction of apoptosis via activation of caspases 9/caspases 3 contributed to the synergistic effect of this combination therapy. In the xenograft model, the combination showed a significantly higher antitumor activity. Immunohistochemistry of post treatment tumors showed a significant decrease in proliferation and angiogenesis as compared to either of the treatments alone. This study demonstrates the synergistic antitumor activity of combination of dovitinib and oxaliplatin against colon cancer with different RAS-RAF status. The combination also showed its antitumor efficacy in a multidrug resistant phenotype xenograft model. This provides a basis for further investigation for its potential in clinical setting for colorectal cancer.	0
Genomic instability at the 13q31 locus and somatic mtDNA mutation in the D-loop site correlate with tumor aggressiveness in sporadic Brazilian breast cancer cases. || Adult Age Distribution Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Brazil Breast Neoplasms Carcinoma Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 Cohort Studies DNA, Mitochondrial Female Genes, p53 Genetic Loci Genomic Instability Humans Loss of Heterozygosity Microsatellite Repeats Middle Aged Neoplasm Grading || Genomic instability is a hallmark of malignant tissues. In this work, we aimed to characterize nuclear and mitochondrial instabilities by determining short tandem repeats and somatic mitochondrial mutations, respectively, in a cohort of Brazilian sporadic breast cancer cases. Furthermore, we performed an association analysis of the molecular findings and the clinical pathological data. We analyzed 64 matched pairs of breast cancer and adjacent non-cancerous breast samples by genotyping 13 nuclear short tandem repeat loci (namely, D2S123, TPOX, D3S1358, D3S1611, FGA, D7S820, TH01, D13S317, D13S790, D16S539, D17S796, intron 12 BRCA1 and intron 1 TP53) that were amplified with the fluorescent AmpFlSTR Identifiler Genotyping system (Applied Biosystems, USA) and by silver nitrate staining following 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Somatic mtDNA mutations in the D-loop site were assessed with direct sequencing of the hypervariable HVI and HVII mitochondrial regions. Half of the cancer tissues presented some nuclear instability. Interestingly, the D13S790 locus was the most frequently affected (36%), while the D2S123 locus presented no alterations. Forty-two percent of the cases showed somatic mitochondrial mutations, the majority at region 303-315 poly-C. We identified associations between Elston grade III, instabilities at 13q31 region (p = 0.0264) and mtDNA mutations (p = 0.0041). Furthermore, instabilities at 13q31 region were also associated with TP53 mutations in the invasive ductal carcinoma cases (p= 0.0207). Instabilities at 13q31 region and the presence of somatic mtDNA mutations in a D-loop site correlated with tumor aggressiveness.	4
Tegumentary manifestations of Noonan and Noonan-related syndromes. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Noonan Syndrome Prospective Studies Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Sex Factors Skin Skin Diseases Surveys and Questionnaires Young Adult || Noonan and Noonan-related syndromes are common autosomal dominant disorders with neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous and developmental involvement. The objective of this article is to describe the most relevant tegumentary findings in a cohort of 41 patients with Noonan or Noonan-related syndromes and to detail certain aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying ectodermal involvement. A standard questionnaire was administered. A focused physical examination and a systematic review of clinical records was performed on all patients to verify the presence of tegumentary alterations. The molecular analysis of this cohort included sequencing of the following genes in all patients: PTPN1, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, SHOC2 and BRAF. The most frequent tegumentary alterations were xeroderma (46%), photosensitivity (29%), excessive hair loss (24%), recurrent oral ulcers (22%), curly hair (20%), nevi (17%), markedly increased palmar and plantar creases (12%), follicular hyperkeratosis (12%), palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (10%), café-au-lait spots (10%) and sparse eyebrows (7%). Patients with mutations in PTPN11 had lower frequencies of palmar and plantar creases and palmar/plantar hyperkeratosis compared with the other patients. We observed that patients with mutations in genes directly involved in cell proliferation kinase cascades (SOS1, BRAF, KRAS and RAF1) had a higher frequency of hyperkeratotic lesions compared with patients with mutations in genes that have a more complex interaction with and modulation of cell proliferation kinase cascades (PTPN11).	4
A large deletion including most of GJB6 in recessive non syndromic deafness: a digenic effect? || Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Deafness Gene Deletion Genes, Recessive Humans || Congenital profound deafness has a known genetic origin in more than 50% of all cases. The majority of the non syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) show an autosomal recessive inheritance. Mutations in the GJB2 gene (connexin 26) account for more than 50% of the recessive non syndromic deafness (DFNB1) among 30 loci. Other connexin genes have been more rarely involved and attention was given here to the GJB6 gene (connexin 30). We show that homozygous deletion of a minimal 150 kb region encompassing this gene causes NSHL. More strikingly, association of this deletion in trans of the GJB2 gene 35delG or E47X mutations is also associated with NSHL.	4
Allosteric regulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase. || Allosteric Regulation Animals Humans Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phosphorylation || The liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for conversion of excess phenylalanine in the diet to tyrosine. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is activated by phenylalanine; this activation is inhibited by the physiological reducing substrate tetrahydrobiopterin. Phosphorylation of Ser16 lowers the concentration of phenylalanine for activation. This review discusses the present understanding of the molecular details of the allosteric regulation of the enzyme.	3
An infant with combination gene mutations for Monogenic Diabetes of Youth (MODY) 2 and 4, presenting with Diabetes Mellitus Requiring Insulin (DMRI) at 8 months of age. || Adult Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Family Health Female Glucokinase Homeodomain Proteins Humans Hypoglycemic Agents Infant Insulin Male Trans-Activators || Monogenic Diabetes of Youth (MODY) is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes. [Fajans SS, et al. NEJM 2001: 345: 971-980.] There are at least six different types of MODY, all of which involve a loss of function gene mutation that results in diminished insulin production. MODY2 results from a mutation in the glucokinase gene (GCK), which decreases enzyme activity. MODY4 results from a mutation in the insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) gene, a transcription factor which regulates the transcription of insulin. [Sperling M, et al. NEJM 2006: 355: 507-510.] TJ presented at 8 months of age with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin (DMRI) with negative islet autoantibodies. She had a prolonged honeymoon period, as evidenced by her insulin requirement of 0.5 units/kg/day at three years of age. Genetic testing showed combination MODY2 (c.1019+18G >A) and MODY4 (c.226G>A) gene mutations. The father was homozygous for MODY2 and the mother was heterozygous for MODY4. [Athena Diagnostics Evaluations "2007 # 839 - Monogenic Diabetes (MODY) Evaluation for the patient, the patient's father, and the patient's mother] Neither parent had diabetes mellitus. The clinical course and negative islet autoantibodies support that the combination of benign MODY2 and MODY4 gene mutations in the parents resulted in DMRI in TJ.	4
Identification of genomic DNA sequences bound by mutant p53 protein (Gly245-->Ser) in vivo. || Amino Acid Substitution Chromatin Cisplatin Cross-Linking Reagents DNA Humans Microscopy, Fluorescence Mutation, Missense Polymerase Chain Reaction Precipitin Tests Protein Binding Recombinant Proteins Sequence Analysis, DNA Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutant p53 proteins were shown to exert complex DNA-interactions in vitro, like binding to MAR-DNA, but so far it is unknown whether such interactions also occur in vivo. Therefore we analysed the binding of mutant (mut) p53 (Gly245-->Ser) in Onda 11 glioma cells to cellular DNA in vivo, using p53-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) after in vivo cross-linking of mut p53 to genomic DNA with cisplatin. We identified genomic DNA fragments to which mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) could be cross-linked in vivo. Purified recombinant mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) was able to bind specifically to such elements in PCR-EMSA in vitro, supporting the idea that this mut p53 protein interacts with genomic DNA in vivo. The genomic DNA fragments identified are vastly different in sequence, but display as a common feature a high likelihood to adopt a non B-DNA conformation. Therefore we propose that structural determinants within these DNA elements are important for their interaction with mut p53 (Gly245-->Ser) in vivo. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4178 - 4183	0
Pathogenic gene screening in 91 Chinese patients with short stature of unknown etiology with a targeted next-generation sequencing panel. ||  || Dwarfism is a common severe growth disorder, but the etiology is unclear in the majority of cases. Recombinant human growth hormone may be a treatment option, but it has limited efficacy. The currently known laboratory assays do not meet the precision requirements for clinical diagnosis. Here, we have constructed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of selected genes that are suspected to be associated with dwarfism for genetic screening. Genetic screening of 91 children with short stature of unknown etiology was performed with the help of the NGS panel. All the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of 166 genes were included in the panel. To clarify the pathogenicity of these mutations, their clinical data were reviewed and analyzed. The assay identified p.A72G, p.I282V, and p.P491S variants of the PTPN11 gene and a p.I437T variant of the SOS1 gene in 4 cases with Noonan syndrome. A frameshift mutation (p.D2407fs) of the ACAN gene was identified in a case of idiopathic short stature with moderately advanced bone age. A p.R904C variant of the COL2A1 gene was found in a patient, who was accordingly diagnosed with Stickler syndrome. Severe short stature without limb deformity was associated with a p.G11A variant of HOXD13. In addition, we evaluated evidence that a p.D401N variant of the COMP gene may cause multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Our findings suggest that syndromes, particularly Noonan syndrome, may be overlooked due to atypical clinical features. This gene panel has been verified to be effective for the rapid screening of genetic etiologies associated with short stature and for guiding precision medicine-based clinical management.	4
Mutation detection in Croatian patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. || Adult Base Sequence Croatia Female Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Middle Aged Mutation Young Adult || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the genes for LDLR, APOB or PCSK9, and identification of the causative mutation provides definitive diagnosis so that the patient can be treated, their relatives tested and, therefore, premature heart disease prevented. DNA of eight unrelated individuals with clinically diagnosed FH were analyzed using a High-Resolution Melting method (HRM) for the LDLR gene (coding region, promoter and intron/exon boundaries), the APOB gene (part exon 26) and the PCSK9 gene (exon7). Variations found were sequenced and the effect on function of confirmed variants examined using predictive algorithms. Gross deletions and insertions were analysed using MLPA. Three novel LDLR variants were found, p.(S470C), p.(C698R) and c.2312-2A>C. All were predicted to be pathogenic using predictive algorithms. Three previously reported disease-causing mutations were identified (p.(G20R), p.(N272T) and p.(S286R); the latter was also carried by a hypercholesterolaemic relative. One patient carried the pathogenic APOB variant p.(R3527Q). No large LDLR deletions nor insertions were found, neither were any PCSK9 variants identified. HRM is a sensitive method for screening for mutations. While the causative mutation has been identified in 88% of these clinically defined FH patients, there appears to be a high degree of allelic heterogeneity in Croatian patients.	4
A novel rasopathy caused by recurrent de novo missense mutations in PPP1CB closely resembles Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair. || Brain Child Child, Preschool Dandy-Walker Syndrome Diagnostic Imaging Exome Facies Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Loose Anagen Hair Syndrome Male Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Protein Phosphatase 1 Young Adult ras Proteins || Noonan syndrome is a rasopathy caused by mutations in multiple genes encoding components of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Despite its variable phenotype, limited genotype-phenotype correlations exist. Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS-LAH) is characterized by its distinctive hair anomalies, developmental differences, and structural brain abnormalities and is caused by a single recurrent missense SHOC2 mutation. SHOC2 forms a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C). Protein phosphatases counterbalance kinases and control activation of signaling proteins, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Here we report four patients with de novo missense mutations in protein phosphatase one catalytic subunit beta (PPP1CB), sharing a recognizable phenotype. Three individuals had the recurrent PPP1CB c.146G>C, p.Pro49Arg mutation, the fourth had a c.166G>C, p.Ala56Pro change. All had relative or absolute macrocephaly, low-set and posteriorly angulated ears, and developmental delay. Slow growing and/or sparse hair and/or an unruly hair texture was present in all. Three individuals had feeding difficulties requiring feeding tubes. One of two males had cryptorchidism, another had pectus excavatum. Short stature was present in three. A female with the recurrent mutation had a Dandy-Walker malformation and optic nerve hypoplasia. Mild ventriculomegaly occurred in all, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia was seen in two and progressed to Chiari 1 malformation in one individual. Based on the combination of phenotypic findings and PPP1CB's effect on RAF dephosphorylation within the RAS/MAPK pathway, this novel condition can be considered a rasopathy, most similar to NS-LAH. Collectively, these mutations meet the standardized criteria for pathogenicity. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	4
Effects of p21-activated kinase 1 inhibition on 11q13-amplified ovarian cancer cells. || Animals Cell Cycle Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Proliferation Cyclin B1 Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mice Ovarian Neoplasms Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays p21-Activated Kinases || p21-activated kinases (Paks) are Cdc42/Rac-activated serine-threonine protein kinases that regulate several key cancer-relevant signaling pathways, such as the Mek/Erk, PI3K/Akt and Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways. Pak1 is frequently overexpressed and/or hyperactivated in different human cancers, including human breast, ovary, prostate and brain cancer, due to amplification of the PAK1 gene in an 11q13 amplicon. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of Pak1 has been shown to reduce proliferation of different cancer cells in vitro and reduce tumor progression in vivo. In this work, we examined the roles of Pak1 in cellular and animal models of PAK1-amplified ovarian cancer. We found that inhibition of Pak1 leads to decreased proliferation and migration in PAK1-amplified/overexpressed ovarian cancer cells, and has no effect in cell that lack such amplification/overexpression. Further, we observed that loss of Pak1 function causes 11q13-amplified ovarian cancer cells to arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This arrest correlates with activation of p53 and p21(Cip) and decreased expression of cyclin B1. These findings suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of Pak1 may have a therapeutic role in the ~25% of ovarian cancers characterized by PAK1 gene amplification.	0
Genetic alterations of differentiated thyroid carcinoma in iodine-rich and iodine-deficient countries. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Papillary DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Rearrangement Humans Iodine Japan Male Middle Aged Mutation Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Retrospective Studies Thyroid Cancer, Papillary Thyroid Neoplasms Vietnam Young Adult ras Proteins || BRAF V600E mutation, RET rearrangements, and RAS mutations are the common genetic alterations in differentiated thyroid carcinomas derived from follicular thyroid cells. However, the relationship between these alterations and iodine intake is still controversial. To clarify the influence of iodine intake on the occurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinomas, we performed molecular analyses for two differentiated carcinomas, papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), from an iodine-rich country (Japan) and an iodine-deficient country (Vietnam). We examined 120 PTCs (67 Japanese and 53 Vietnamese) and 74 FTCs (51 Japanese and 23 Vietnamese). We carried out allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) for BRAF V600E, PCR and direct sequencing for RAS mutations (codon 12, 13, and 61 in NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS), and RT-PCR for RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3. BRAF V600E was present in 55/67 (82.1%) Japanese PTCs and 44/53 (83%) Vietnamese PTCs. RET/PTC1 was identified in only one PTC from each country, and no samples had RET/PTC3. NRAS mutation was found in 17/51 (33.3%) Japanese FTCs and 4/23 (17.4%) Vietnamese FTCs. NRAS mutation was cited in codon 61 (20 cases) and codon 12 (one case). None of FTCs had KRAS or HRAS mutations. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of BRAF V600E, RET/PTC, or RAS mutations between the two countries. Our study showed no differences in genetic alterations of thyroid cancers from iodine-rich and iodine-deficient countries, possibly suggesting that iodine intake might not affect the genetic alterations of differentiated thyroid cancer.	4
A comprehensive custom panel design for routine hereditary cancer testing: preserving control, improving diagnostics and revealing a complex variation landscape. || Early Detection of Cancer Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary Sensitivity and Specificity || We wanted to implement an NGS strategy to globally analyze hereditary cancer with diagnostic quality while retaining the same degree of understanding and control we had in pre-NGS strategies. To do this, we developed the I2HCP panel, a custom bait library covering 122 hereditary cancer genes. We improved bait design, tested different NGS platforms and created a clinically driven custom data analysis pipeline. The I2HCP panel was developed using a training set of hereditary colorectal cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and neurofibromatosis patients and reached an accuracy, analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 99%, which was maintained in a validation set. I2HCP changed our diagnostic approach, involving clinicians and a genetic diagnostics team from panel design to reporting. The new strategy improved diagnostic sensitivity, solved uncertain clinical diagnoses and identified mutations in new genes. We assessed the genetic variation in the complete set of hereditary cancer genes, revealing a complex variation landscape that coexists with the disease-causing mutation. We developed, validated and implemented a custom NGS-based strategy for hereditary cancer diagnostics that improved our previous workflows. Additionally, the existence of a rich genetic variation in hereditary cancer genes favors the use of this panel to investigate their role in cancer risk.	4
Retinal dystrophy in two boys with Costello syndrome due to the HRAS p.Gly13Cys mutation. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adult Child Costello Syndrome Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Retinal Dystrophies || Features of Costello Syndrome, a systemic disorder caused by germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS from the RAS/MAPK pathway, include failure-to-thrive, short stature, coarse facial features, cardiac defects including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, intellectual disability, and predisposition to neoplasia. Two unrelated boys with Costello syndrome and an HRAS mutation (p.Gly13Cys) are presented with their ophthalmologic findings. Both had early symptoms of nystagmus, photophobia, and vision abnormalities. Fundus examination findings of retinal dystrophy were present at age 3 years. Both boys have abnormal electroretinograms with reduced or undetectable rod responses along with reduced cone responses consistent with rod-cone dystrophy. Our observations suggest that early ophthalmic examination and re-evaluations are indicated in children with Costello syndrome.	4
Mutant p53 protects ETS2 from non-canonical COP1/DET1 dependent degradation. || A549 Cells Carrier Proteins Gene Knockdown Techniques Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-2 Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases || Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 contribute to the development of approximately half of all human cancers. One mechanism by which mutant p53 (mtp53) acts is through interaction with other transcription factors, which can either enhance or repress the transcription of their target genes. Mtp53 preferentially interacts with the erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue 2 (ETS2), an ETS transcription factor, and increases its protein stability. To study the mechanism underlying ETS2 degradation, we knocked down ubiquitin ligases known to interact with ETS2. We observed that knockdown of the constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (COP1) and its binding partner De-etiolated 1 (DET1) significantly increased ETS2 stability, and conversely, their ectopic expression led to increased ETS2 ubiquitination and degradation. Surprisingly, we observed that DET1 binds to ETS2 independently of COP1, and we demonstrated that mutation of multiple sites required for ETS2 degradation abrogated the interaction between DET1 and ETS2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mtp53 prevents the COP1/DET1 complex from ubiquitinating ETS2 and thereby marking it for destruction. Mechanistically, we show that mtp53 destabilizes DET1 and also disrupts the DET1/ETS2 complex thereby preventing ETS2 degradation. Our study reveals a hitherto unknown function in which DET1 mediates the interaction with the substrates of its cognate ubiquitin ligase complex and provides an explanation for the ability of mtp53 to protect ETS2.	0
Description and analysis of genetic variants in French hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families recorded in the UMD-BRCA1/BRCA2 databases. || Breast Neoplasms Databases, Nucleic Acid Female France Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Variation Humans Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Software || BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two main genes responsible for predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers, as a result of protein-inactivating monoallelic mutations. It remains to be established whether many of the variants identified in these two genes, so-called unclassified/unknown variants (UVs), contribute to the disease phenotype or are simply neutral variants (or polymorphisms). Given the clinical importance of establishing their status, a nationwide effort to annotate these UVs was launched by laboratories belonging to the French GGC consortium (Groupe Génétique et Cancer), leading to the creation of the UMD-BRCA1/BRCA2 databases (http://www.umd.be/BRCA1/ and http://www.umd.be/BRCA2/). These databases have been endorsed by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) and are designed to collect all variants detected in France, whether causal, neutral or UV. They differ from other BRCA databases in that they contain co-occurrence data for all variants. Using these data, the GGC French consortium has been able to classify certain UVs also contained in other databases. In this article, we report some novel UVs not contained in the BIC database and explore their impact in cancer predisposition based on a structural approach.	4
Effects of germline mutations in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway on adaptive behavior: cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Noonan syndrome. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adaptation, Psychological Adolescent Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Craniofacial Abnormalities Ectodermal Dysplasia Female Genes, ras Genetic Association Studies Germ-Line Mutation Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Infant MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Noonan Syndrome Syndrome Young Adult || Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC) and Noonan syndrome (NS) are two phenotypically overlapping genetic disorders whose underlying molecular etiologies affect a common signaling pathway. Mutations in the BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 genes cause most cases of CFC and mutations in PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, and RAF1 typically cause NS. Although both syndromes are associated with developmental delays of varying severity, the extent to which the behavioral profiles differ may shed light on the different roles these respective genes play in development of skills necessary for everyday functioning. In this study, profiles of adaptive behavior of individuals with CFC and NS who had confirmed pathogenic mutations in Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes were investigated. Patterns of strengths and weaknesses, age-related differences, and risk factors for difficulties in adaptive skills were assessed. Although genes acting more downstream in the Ras/MAPK pathway were associated with more difficulties in adaptive functioning than genes more upstream in the pathway, several inconsistencies highlight the wide spectrum of possible developmental courses in CFC and NS. Along with clinical and genetic factors, variables such as chronological age, gestational age at birth, and parental education levels accounted for significant variance in adaptive skills. Results indicate that there is wide heterogeneity in adaptive functioning in CFC and NS, but that these abilities are correlated to some extent with the specific disease-causing genes.	4
Tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in Dutch neonates. ||  || Four neonates with a positive phenylalanine screening test (Phe concentrations between 258 and 1250 micromol/L) were investigated further to differentiate between phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency and variant hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) forms. In patients 1 and 2 a tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) load caused a significant decrease of the plasma Phe levels. A combined phenylalanine/BH4 loading test was performed in patients 2, 3 and 4. In the latter two patients, plasma Phe concentrations completely normalized within 8 h after the BH4 load (20 mg/kg). Basal urinary pterins were normal in all four patients. The activity of dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) was normal in patients 1, 2 and 3 and 50% of control values in patient 4 (not in the range of DHPR-deficient patients). In patient 3 a subsequent phenylalanine loading test with concomitant analysis of plasma biopterins revealed a normal increase of biopterin, excluding a BH4 biosynthesis defect. Pterins and neurotransmitter metabolites in CSF of patients 1, 3 and 4 were normal. DNA mutations detected in the PAH gene of patients 1-4 were A313T, and L367fsinsC; V190A and R243X; A300S and A403V; R241C and A403V. The results are suggestive for mutant PAH enzymes with decreased affinity for the cofactor BH4.	1 3
Dominant-negative p53 mutant R248Q increases the motile and invasive activities of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. ||  || The tumor suppressor gene TP53 (gene) codes for a transcription factor which transactivates its target genes responsible for cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, apoptosis, and senescence. TP53 is well known to be the most frequent target of genetic mutations in nearly half of human cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Many p53 mutants including R248Q and R248W not only lose its tumor-suppressor activities, but also interfere with the functions of wild-type p53; this is so-called dominant-negative (DN) mutation. The DN p53 mutation is a predictor of poor outcome in patients with various cancers, and also a risk factor for metastatic recurrence in patients with OSCC. Recently it has been reported that DN p53 mutants acquire new oncogenic activities, which is named gain-of-function (GOF). This study aimed at determining whether R248Q and R248W were involved in OSCC cells' acquiring aggressive phenotypes, using SAS, HSC4 and Ca9-22 cell lines. First, two mutants p53, R248Q and R248W, were respectively transfected into SAS cells harboring recessive-type p53 (E336X). As a result, SAS cells expressing R248Q showed highly spreading, motile and invasive activities compared to parent or mock-transfected cells whereas those expressing R248W did not increase those activities. Secondly, in HSC4 cells harboring R248Q and Ca9-22 cells harboring R248W, expressions of the mutants p53 were inhibited by the transfection with siRNAs targeting p53. The inhibition of the mutants p53 decreased spreading, motile and invasive activities of HSC4 cells whereas it did not affect those activities of Ca9-22 cells. These findings suggest that R248Q p53 mutation, but not R248W p53 mutation, induces more motile and invasive potentials in human OSCC cells.	0
Halogen-enriched fragment libraries as leads for drug rescue of mutant p53. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Drug Discovery Drug Evaluation, Preclinical Halogens Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Protein Stability Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The destabilizing p53 cancer mutation Y220C creates a druggable surface crevice. We developed a strategy exploiting halogen bonding for lead discovery to stabilize the mutant with small molecules. We designed halogen-enriched fragment libraries (HEFLibs) as starting points to complement classical approaches. From screening of HEFLibs and subsequent structure-guided design, we developed substituted 2-(aminomethyl)-4-ethynyl-6-iodophenols as p53-Y220C stabilizers. Crystal structures of their complexes highlight two key features: (i) a central scaffold with a robust binding mode anchored by halogen bonding of an iodine with a main-chain carbonyl and (ii) an acetylene linker, enabling the targeting of an additional subsite in the crevice. The best binders showed induction of apoptosis in a human cancer cell line with homozygous Y220C mutation. Our structural and biophysical data suggest a more widespread applicability of HEFLibs in drug discovery.	0
The association between brain natriuretic peptide and tissue Doppler parameters in children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child Child, Preschool Death, Sudden, Cardiac Echocardiography, Doppler Electrocardiography Exons Female Heart Atria Humans Infant Male Mitral Valve Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Natriuretic Peptide, Brain Risk Tricuspid Valve Ventricular Dysfunction, Left Ventricular Function, Left || In this study, we investigated the association between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and tissue Doppler imaging measurements and also screening for deadly mutations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We enrolled 20 patients diagnosed with HCM (age:10.7±5 years (1-17), 85% male, weight:42.25±23.10 kg, height:141.80±32.45 cm) and 20 age, gender and body weight-matched control subjects. We performed electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and tissue Doppler echocardiography in each group, as well as genetic tests (for Arg403Gln, Arg453Cys, Arg719Trp and Arg719Gln mutations in MYH7 Exons 13, 14, 19) and BNP in the patients. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (Group 1) or absence (Group 2) of left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction. QTc dispersion and the LV ejection fraction and left atrial (LA) volume index were increased in Group 1. The LA volume index and the mitral and septal E/Ea ratio and septum Z-score were increased while the mitral lateral annulus and septal annulus Ea wave velocities and the mitral and tricuspid E/A ratio were decreased in patients with high levels of BNP compared to those with normal BNP levels. There were no mutations that are associated with increased risk of sudden death found in patients included in this study. In the light of our data, we conclude that such parameters BNP levels above the 98 pg/mL, septal thickness Z-score ˃6, and higher mitral and septal E/Ea ratios can be used for management of patients with HCM according to life-threatening conditions.	4
Mutation analysis of GJB2 and GJB6 genes in Southeastern Brazilians with hereditary nonsyndromic deafness. || Adolescent Adult Brazil Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation || In developed countries deafness has a genetic cause in over 60% of the cases. Contrastingly, in Brazil, it is estimated that only 16% of all deafnesses are caused by genetic factors. Among hereditary hearing deficiencies, approximately half is caused by mutations in the Gap Junction Protein Beta-2 (GJB2) gene, which encodes the protein Connexin 26 (Cx26). There are four mutations in this gene that present high prevalence in specific ethnical groups, namely, 35delG, 167delT, 235delC, and W24X. The 35delG mutation is the most frequent one, occurring in homozygosity or in compound heterozygosity with mutations in the GJB2 and GJB6 genes. This study aims to determine the prevalence of GJB2-35delG, GJB2-167delT, GJB2-235delC, GJB2-W24X, del (GJB6-D13S1830), and del (GJB6-D13S1854) mutations in patients with nonsyndromic deafness in the Espirito Santo State, Brazil. A total of 77 individuals were evaluated, from which 88.3% presented normal genotypes for all analyzed mutations, 1.3% were compound heterozygotes for 35delG-GJB2/D13S1830-GJB6, 1.3% were compound heterozygotes for 35delG/D13S1854-GJB6, 3.9% were homozygotes for the 35delG mutation and 5.2% were heterozygotes for 35delG/GJB2. The frequency of mutant alleles 35delG/GJB2, del (D13S1830/GJB6), and del (D13S1854/GJB6) was 7.8, 0.65, and 0.65%, respectively. Mutations 167delT, 235delC, and W24X were not detected. Determining the prevalence of specific mutations related to inherited deafness in a population can contribute to the development of more efficient and affordable molecular diagnostic protocols, and help in the genetic counseling of patients and their families.	4
Systematic analysis of mitochondrial genes associated with hearing loss in the Japanese population: dHPLC reveals a new candidate mutation. || Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Hearing Loss Humans Japan Male Middle Aged Pedigree || Variants of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been evaluated for their association with hearing loss. Although ethnic background affects the spectrum of mtDNA variants, systematic mutational analysis of mtDNA in Japanese patients with hearing loss has not been reported. Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography combined with direct sequencing and cloning-sequencing, Japanese patients with prelingual (N = 54) or postlingual (N = 80) sensorineural hearing loss not having pathogenic mutations of m.1555A > G and m.3243A > G nor GJB2 were subjected to mutational analysis of mtDNA genes (12S rRNA, tRNALeu(UUR), tRNASer(UCN), tRNALys, tRNAHis, tRNASer(AGY), and tRNAGlu). We discovered 15 variants in 12S rRNA and one homoplasmic m.7501A > G variant in tRNASer(UCN); no variants were detected in the other genes. Two criteria, namely the low frequency in the controls and the high conservation among animals, selected the m.904C > T and the m.1105T > C variants in 12S rRNA as candidate pathogenic mutations. Alterations in the secondary structures of the two variant transcripts as well as that of m.7501A > G in tRNASer(UCN) were predicted. The m.904C > T variant was found to be a new candidate mutation associated with hearing loss. The m.1105T > C variant is unlikely to be pathogenic. The pathogenicity of the homoplasmic m.7501T > A variant awaits further study.	4
Genetic Screening of GJB2 and SLC26A4 in Korean Cochlear Implantees: Experience of Soree Ear Clinic. ||  || Genetic hearing loss is highly heterogeneous and more than 100 genes are predicted to cause this disorder in humans. In spite of this large genetic heterogeneity, mutations in SLC26A4 and GJB2 genes are primarily responsible for the major etiologies of genetic hearing loss among Koreans. The purpose of this study is to investigate the genetic cause of deafness in Korean cochlear implantees by performing a genetic screening of the SLC26A4 and GJB2 genes. The study cohort included 421 unrelated Korean patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and who had received cochlear implants (CI) at Soree Ear Clinic from July 2002 to December 2010. Among 421 CI patients, we studied 230 cases who had received the genetic screening for SLC26A4 or GJB2 genes. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All patients had severe to profound, bilateral hearing loss. For 56 patients who showed enlarged vestibular aqueduct on their computed tomography (CT) scan, we analyzed SLC26A4. For 174 CT negative patients, GJB2 gene was sequenced. For the 56 SLC26A4 patients, 32 (57.1%) had two pathogenic recessive mutations in SLC26A4. A single recessive SLC26A4 mutation was identified in 14 patients (25%). H723R and IVS7-2A>G were the most commonly found mutations, accounting for 60.3% (47/78) and 30.8% (24/78) of the mutated alleles, respectively. For the 174 GJB2 patients, 20 patients (11.5%) had two pathogenic recessive mutations in GJB2. 235delC was the most common mutation, accounting for 43.0% (31/72) of mutant alleles. The two major genes, SLC26A4 and GJB2, contribute major causes of deafness in CI patients. Continuous studies are needed to identify new genes that can cause hearing loss to Korean CI patients.	1
[The research of combining high resolution melting with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technology in the mutation scanning for PAH gene]. ||  || To explore the value of combining high resolution melting (HRM) with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detecting mutations underlying phenylketonuria. HRM was used for detecting small mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) of 26 phenylketonuria patients. The results were verified with DNA sequencing. MLPA was used for detecting potential deletions/duplications in the PAH gene. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis was performed for additional potential mutations. A total of 21 mutations were found in 44/52 alleles (84.62%), which included a dupEx4. Among the 21 types of mutation, 19 were reported previously, and the remaining two were novel mutations: c.584_585insA and IVS10+1G>T. In addition, the mutation of R243Q (25%) was the most common type in China. The study showed that the combination of HRM and MLPA could increase the detection rate for mutation in PKU. The study has added new information to the human mutation database of PAH and provided a basis for clinical diagnosis and prenatal counseling.	3
Insights into the Effect of the G245S Single Point Mutation on the Structure of p53 and the Binding of the Protein to DNA. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Molecular Dynamics Simulation Point Mutation Protein Binding Structure-Activity Relationship Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The transcription factor p53 is a potent tumor suppressor dubbed as the "guardian of the genome" because of its ability to orchestrate protective biological outputs in response to a variety of oncogenic stresses. Mutation and thus inactivation of p53 can be found in 50% of human tumors. The majority are missense mutations located in the DNA binding region. Among them, G245S is known to be a structural hotspot mutation. To understand the behaviors and differences between the wild-type and mutant, both a dimer of the wild type p53 (wt-p53) and its G245S mutant (G245S-mp53), complexed with DNA, were simulated using molecular dynamics for more than 1 μs. wt-p53 and G245S-mp53 apo monomers were simulated for 1 μs as well. Conformational analyses and binding energy evaluations performed underline important differences and therefore provide insights to understand the G245S-mp53 loss of function. Our results indicate that the G245S mutation destabilizes several structural regions in the protein that are crucial for DNA binding when found in its apo form and highlight differences in the mutant-DNA complex structure compared to the wt protein. These findings not only provide means that can be applied to other p53 mutants but also serve as structural basis for further studies aimed at the development of cancer therapies based on restoring the function of p53.	0
Comprehensive BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation analyses and review of French Canadian families with at least three cases of breast cancer. || Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Canada Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm European Continental Ancestry Group Female Founder Effect Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Middle Aged Polymerase Chain Reaction Risk Factors || Few studies have reported on the comprehensive BRCA1/2 mutation analyses of hereditary breast cancer (HBC) families of French Canadian descent. Here we report the investigation of 82 families with at least 3 cases of breast cancer evaluated for mutations by DNA sequencing and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. DNA sequencing identified pathogenic mutations in 37 (45.1%) families, of which 70.2% were one of three recurring mutations (BRCA1:R1443X, BRCA2:8765delAG, and BRCA2:E1953X) frequently reported in this founder population; and variants of uncertain clinical significance in 7 (8.5%) families of which two harbored BRCA2:E3002K. MLPA analysis of the 38 DNA sequence-negative families did not reveal any large rearrangements in BRCA1/2. A phenotypic characterization of the cancer families based on pathogenic mutation status revealed that there were significantly fewer very young age at diagnosis breast cancer cases (<36 years) in mutation-negative families (5.9%, 9 of 153) than in BRCA1 (22.8%, 13 of 57; P = 0.0003) or BRCA2 (22.9%, 27 of 118; P < 1× 10E5) mutation-positive families. There were significantly more mutation-positive families (29 of 36, 80.6%) with a very young age of onset of breast cancer case than those that did not (8 of 39, 20.5%) (P < 10E6). The comprehensive mutation analysis of BRCA1/2 suggests that genomic rearrangements are unlikely to account for sequence-negative HBC families and affirms that the presence of a very young age of diagnosis of breast cancer is strongly predictive of mutation carrier status of French Canadian HBC families.	4
Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of TERT Are Associated with Inferior Outcome in Adolescent and Young Adult Patients with Melanoma. || Adolescent Adult Child DNA Methylation Epigenesis, Genetic Female Gene Expression Humans Male Melanoma Promoter Regions, Genetic Survival Analysis Telomerase Treatment Outcome Up-Regulation Young Adult || Progression of melanoma to distant sites in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) is not reliably predicted by clinicopathologic criteria. TERT promoter mutations when combined with BRAF/NRAS mutations correlate with adverse outcome in adult melanoma. To determine the prognostic value of TERT alterations in AYA melanoma, we investigated the association of TERT promoter mutations, as well as promoter methylation, an epigenetic alteration also linked to TERT upregulation, with TERT mRNA expression and outcome using a well-characterized cohort of 27 patients with melanoma (ages 8-25, mean 20). TERT mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in tumors harboring TERT promoter mutation and/or hypermethylation than those without either aberration (P = 0.046). TERT promoter mutations alone did not predict adverse outcomes (P = 0.50), but the presence of TERT promoter methylation, alone or concurrent with promoter mutations, correlated with reduced recurrence-free survival (P = 0.001). These data suggest that genetic and epigenetic alterations of TERT are associated with TERT upregulation and may predict clinical outcomes in AYA melanoma. A more exhaustive understanding of the different molecular mechanisms leading to increased TERT expression may guide development of prognostic assays to stratify AYA melanoma patients according to clinical risk.	4
Comprehensive Genetic Analysis of Japanese Autosomal Dominant Sensorineural Hearing Loss Patients. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group Female Genes, Dominant Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Testing Genotyping Techniques Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Japan Male || In general, autosomal dominant inherited hearing loss does not have a founder mutation, with the causative mutation different in each family. For this reason, there has been a strong need for efficient diagnosis methods for autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss (ADSNHL) patients. This study sought to verify the effectiveness of our analysis algorithm for the screening of ADSNHL patients as well as the usefulness of the massively parallel DNA sequencing (MPS). Seventy-five Japanese ADSNHL patients from 53 ENT departments nationwide participated in this study. We conducted genetic analysis of 75 ADSNHL patients using the Invader assay, TaqMan genotyping assay and MPS-based genetic screening. A total of 46 (61.3%) ADSNHL patients were found to have at least one candidate gene variant. We were able to achieve a high mutation detection rate through the combination of the Invader assay, TaqMan genotyping assay and MPS. MPS could be used to successfully identify mutations in rare deafness genes.	4
MassARRAY-based simultaneous detection of hotspot somatic mutations and recurrent fusion genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma: the PTC-MA assay. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles DNA, Neoplasm Female Gene Fusion Gene Rearrangement Humans Male Mass Spectrometry Microarray Analysis Middle Aged Mutation Paraffin Embedding Point Mutation Thyroid Cancer, Papillary Thyroid Neoplasms Young Adult || We exploited the MassARRAY (MA) genotyping platform to develop the "PTC-MA assay", which allows the simultaneous detection of 13 hotspot mutations, in the BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, TERT, AKT1, PIK3CA, and EIF1AX genes, and six recurrent genetic rearrangements, involving the RET and TRK genes in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). The assay was developed using DNA and cDNA from 12 frozen and 11 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples from 23 PTC cases, together with positive and negative controls. The PTC-MA assay displays high sensitivity towards point mutations and gene rearrangements, detecting their presence at frequencies as low as 5%. Moreover, this technique allows quantification of the mutated alleles identified at each tested locus. The PTC-MA assay is a novel MA test, which is able to detect fusion genes generated by genomic rearrangements concomitantly with the analysis of hotspot point mutations, thus allowing the evaluation of key diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers of PTC in a single experiment without any informatics analysis. As the assay is sensitive, robust, easily achievable, and affordable, it is suitable for the diagnostic practice. Finally, the PTC-MA assay can be easily implemented and updated by adding novel genetic markers, according to clinical requirements.	4
CDKN2B Loss Promotes Progression from Benign Melanocytic Nevus to Melanoma. || Animals Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Chromatin Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15 DNA Mutational Analysis Disease Models, Animal Disease Progression Epigenesis, Genetic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Heterografts Humans Immunohistochemistry Melanocytes Melanoma Mice Mutation Nevus Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Signal Transduction Transcriptional Activation Transforming Growth Factor beta || Deletion of the entire CDKN2B-CDKN2A gene cluster is among the most common genetic events in cancer. The tumor-promoting effects are generally attributed to loss of CDKN2A-encoded p16 and p14ARF tumor suppressors. The degree to which the associated CDKN2B-encoded p15 loss contributes to human tumorigenesis is unclear. Here, we show that CDKN2B is highly upregulated in benign melanocytic nevi, contributes to maintaining nevus melanocytes in a growth-arrested premalignant state, and is commonly lost in melanoma. Using primary melanocytes isolated directly from freshly excised human nevi naturally expressing the common BRAF(V600E)-activating mutation, nevi progressing to melanoma, and normal melanocytes engineered to inducibly express BRAF(V600E), we show that BRAF activation results in reversible, TGFβ-dependent, p15 induction that halts proliferation. Furthermore, we engineer human skin grafts containing nevus-derived melanocytes to establish a new, architecturally faithful, in vivo melanoma model, and demonstrate that p15 loss promotes the transition from benign nevus to melanoma. Although BRAF(V600E) mutations cause melanocytes to initially proliferate into benign moles, mechanisms responsible for their eventual growth arrest are unknown. Using melanocytes from human moles, we show that BRAF activation leads to a CDKN2B induction that is critical for restraining BRAF oncogenic effects, and when lost, contributes to melanoma.	0

Enzyme responsible for this process is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that maintains an altered methylation pattern by copying it from parent to daughter DNA strands after replication. Aberrant methylation of the promoter regions of genes critical for normal cellular functions is potentially reversible. Therefore, inactivation of DNMT1 seems to be a valuable target for the development of cancer therapies. Currently, the most popular DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) are cytidine analogues like 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside (zebularine). In colorectal cancer, epigenetic modifications play an essential role at each step of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we have addressed the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors may potentiate inhibitory effects of classical chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), commonly used in colorectal cancer therapy. Here, our report shows that DNMTi can have positive interactions with standard chemotherapeutics in colorectal cancer treatment. Using pharmacological models for the drug-drug interaction analysis, we have revealed that the combination of decitabine with 5-FU or oxaliplatin shows the most attractive interaction (synergism), whereas the effect of zebularine in combinations with chemotherapeutics is moderate and may be depended on genetic/epigenetic background of a cell line or secondary drug used in combination. Our results suggest that DNMTi administered in combination with standard chemotherapeutics might improve the treatment of patients with colorectal cancers.	0

BRCA genetic screening in Middle Eastern and North African: mutational spectrum and founder BRCA1 mutation (c.798_799delTT) in North African. || Africa, Northern Breast Neoplasms Female Gene Frequency Genes, BRCA1 Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Middle East Mutation || The contribution of BRCA1 mutations to both hereditary and sporadic breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) has not yet been thoroughly investigated in MENA. To establish the knowledge about BRCA1 mutations and their correlation with the clinical aspect in diagnosed cases of HBOC in MENA populations. A systematic review of studies examining BRCA1 in BC women in Cyprus, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia was conducted. Thirteen relevant references were identified, including ten studies which performed DNA sequencing of all BRCA1 exons. For the latter, 31 mutations were detected in 57 of the 547 patients ascertained. Familial history of BC was present in 388 (71%) patients, of whom 50 were mutation carriers. c.798_799delTT was identified in 11 North African families, accounting for 22% of total identified BRCA1 mutations, suggesting a founder allele. A broad spectrum of other mutations including c.68_69delAG, c.181T>G, c.5095C>T, and c.5266dupC, as well as sequence of unclassified variants and polymorphisms, was also detected. The knowledge of genetic structure of BRCA1 in MENA should contribute to the assessment of the necessity of preventive programs for mutation carriers and clinical management. The high prevalence of BC and the presence of frequent mutations of the BRCA1 gene emphasize the need for improving screening programs and individual testing/counseling.	4
Genetic advances in sarcomeric cardiomyopathies: state of the art. || Animals Cardiomyopathies Computational Biology DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genetic Therapy Humans Mutation Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Risk Factors Sarcomeres || Genetic studies in the 1980s and 1990s led to landmark discoveries that sarcomere mutations cause both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Sarcomere mutations also likely play a role in more complex phenotypes and overlap cardiomyopathies with features of hypertrophy, dilation, diastolic abnormalities, and non-compaction. Identification of the genetic cause of these important conditions provides unique opportunities to interrogate and characterize disease pathogenesis and pathophysiology, starting from the molecular level and expanding from there. With such insights, there is potential for clinical translation that may transform management of patients and families with inherited cardiomyopathies. If key pathways for disease development can be identified, they could potentially serve as targets for novel disease-modifying or disease-preventing therapies. By utilizing gene-based diagnostic testing, we can identify at-risk individuals prior to the onset of clinical disease, allowing for disease-modifying therapy to be initiated early in life, at a time that such treatment may be most successful. In this section, we review the current application of genetics in clinical management, focusing on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a paradigm; discuss state-of-the-art genetic testing technology; review emerging knowledge of gene expression in sarcomeric cardiomyopathies; and discuss both the prospects, as well as the challenges, of bringing genetics to medicine.	4
SHP-2 is a novel target of Abl kinases during cell proliferation. || Animals G1 Phase Humans Mice NIH 3T3 Cells Phosphorylation Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl S Phase Signal Transduction || Previously, we showed that Abl family tyrosine kinases are activated by growth factors, and Abl is required for transition from G1 to S phase during PDGF-mediated proliferation. Here, we show that the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, which acts to promote proliferation in response to cytokines and growth factors, is a novel substrate of endogenous Abl kinases during growth factor-mediated cellular proliferation. Using a pharmacological inhibitor and RNAi, we show that endogenous Abl kinases phosphorylate SHP-2 on Y580, and induce sustained activation of ERK kinases in response to growth factor stimulation in fibroblasts. Consistent with these data, SHP-2 is required for Abl-dependent PDGF-mediated proliferation since expression of an activated form of SHP-2 rescues the ability of Abl-Arg null fibroblasts to transit from G1 to S phase, whereas inhibition of SHP-2 signaling reduces the ability of Abl kinases to rescue the proliferation defect. Abl kinases also indirectly mediate phosphorylation of SHP-2 on Y63 and Y279, which are frequent sites of germline mutation in two cancer susceptibility syndromes. Significantly, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of SHP-2 on Y279 downregulates growth factor-induced sustained ERK activation and proliferation, supporting a role for Abl kinases not only in potentiating growth factor-mediated SHP-2 signaling, but also in negative-feedback regulation.	0
Hypercholesterolemia, low density lipoprotein receptor and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9. ||  || Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. Plasma levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are positively correlated with the risk of atherosclerosis. High plasma LDL concentrations in patients with hypercholesterolemia lead to build-up of LDL in the inner walls of the arteries, which becomes oxidized and promotes the formation of foam cells, consequently initiating atherosclerosis. Plasma LDL is mainly cleared through the LDL receptor (LDLR) pathway. Mutations in the LDLR cause familiar hypercholesterolemia and increase the risk of premature coronary heart disease. The expression of LDLR is regulated at the transcriptional level via the sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) and at the posttranslational levels mainly through proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) and inducible degrader of the LDLR (IDOL). In this review, we summarize the latest advances in the studies of PCSK9.	4
Peptide and small molecules rescue the functional activity and agonist potency of dysfunctional human melanocortin-4 receptor polymorphisms. || Amino Acid Sequence Cell Line Humans Ligands Molecular Sequence Data Peptides Polymorphism, Genetic Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Structural Homology, Protein alpha-MSH || The melanocortin pathway, specifically the melanocortin-4 receptor and the cognate endogenous agonist and antagonist ligands, have been strongly implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and satiety. Genetic studies of morbidly obese human patients and normal weight control patients have resulted in the discovery of over 70 human melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) polymorphisms observed as both heterozygous and homozygous forms. A number of laboratories have been studying these hMC4R polymorphisms attempting to understand the molecular mechanism(s) that might explain the obese human phenotype. Herein, we have studied 13 polymorphic hMC4Rs that have been identified to possess statistically significant decreased endogenous agonist potency with synthetic peptides and small molecules attempting to identify ligands that can pharmacologically rescue the hMC4R polymorphic agonist response. The ligands examined in this study include NDP-MSH, MTII, Ac-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-NH2 (JRH887-9), Ac-Anc-DPhe-Arg-Trp-NH2 (amino-2-naphtylcarboxylic acid, Anc, JRH420-12), Ac-His-(pI)DPhe-Arg-Trp-NH2 (JRH322-18), chimeric AGRP-melanocortin based ligands (Tyr-c[Cys-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]-Tyr-NH2, AMW3-130 and Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)-hAGRP-NH2, AMW3-106), and the small molecules JB25 and THIQ. The hMC4R polymorphisms included in this study are S58C, N97D, I102S, L106P, S127L, T150I, R165Q, R165W, L250Q, G252S, C271Y, Y287Stop, and I301T. These studies resulted in the NDP-MSH, MTII, AMW3-130, THIQ, and AMW3-106 ligands possessing nanomolar to subnanomolar agonist potency at the hMC4R polymorphisms examined in this study. Thus, these ligands could generically rescue the potency and stimulatory response of the abnormally functioning hMC4Rs studied and may provide tools to further clarify the molecular mechanism(s) involving these receptor modifications.	0
[Study of mtDNA 12S rRNA A1555G, GJB2, GJB3 gene mutation in Uighur and Han people with hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss in Xinjiang]. ||  || To study mtDNA, GJB2, GJB3 and determine gene mutation situs and frequency in Uighur and Han people with hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss, and to compare the differences of gene mutation situs and frequency between Uighur and Han people. Blood samples were obtained from 93 patients (43 Uygur and 50 Han) with hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss and 110 normal people (56 Uygur and 54 Han). Genomic DNA was extracted from isolated leukocytes, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products of GJB3 were sequenced directly; while PCR products of mitochondrial DNA 12S rRNA A1555G point mutations were analyzed by PCR-Alw26I digestion, and positive ones were further sequenced. GJB2 genes of 83 patients (43 Uygur and 40 Han) with hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss and 98 normal people (46 Uygur and 52 Han) were directly sequenced. Among GJB3 genes of 93 patients, 2 cases of 33C-T, 2 cases of of 766G-A, 7 cases of 357C-T, and 4 cases of 798C-T were detected. Mitochondrial DNA 12SrRNA A1555G mutation was detected in 8 patients (2 Uygur and 6 Han). Nine kinds of base changes of GJB2 were detected: 109G-A, 233-235delC, 79G-A, 196G-A, 341A-G, 564G-A, 380G-A, 71G-A, and 35delG. In the control group, detected GJB3 mutations included 4 cases of 357C-T, 5 cases of 798C-T, and 2 cases of 93C-T; while 9 kinds of base changes of GJB2 were detected: 341A-G, 380G-A, 457G-A, 79-GA, 109G-A, 281A-G, 21G-T, 171G-T, and 368C-A. For mtDNA 12SrRNA A1555G, the difference between study group of and control group of Han people was statistically significant (P < 0.05). For GJB2 mutation 79G-A, the difference between study group and control group was statistically significant (P < 0.05) in both Uygur and Han people; while for GJB2 mutation 341A-G, the difference in study group between Uygur and Han people was statistically significant (P < 0.05). And for GJB3 mutation 798C-T, the difference was statistically significant both between study group and control group, and between Uygur and Han people (P < 0.05). In Xinjiang, mutation rate was high for mtDNA 12SRNA A1555G. while GJB3 gene mutations were not the main cause of the hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss. There were certain ethnic and geographical characteristics of GJB2and GJB3 mutations.	4
Inhibition of radiation-induced G2 delay potentiates cell death by apoptosis and/or the induction of giant cells in colorectal tumor cells with disrupted p53 function. || Adenoma Amino Acid Substitution Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Death Cell Survival Cesium Radioisotopes Colorectal Neoplasms G2 Phase Genes, p53 Giant Cells Humans Point Mutation Radiation, Ionizing Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We have previously identified a p53-independent apoptotic response that is delayed until 48-72 h after irradiation of colorectal adenoma and carcinoma cells. Because the delay appears to be in part due to a transient G2 cell cycle arrest, the importance of this checkpoint in the mechanism of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced death of colorectal tumor cells was investigated. An adenoma cell line with (282Arg-->Trp) mutant p53 (S/RG/C2) and a carcinoma cell line (PC/JW/FI) lacking p53 protein treated with 5 Gy IR in the presence of 1.5 mm caffeine (CAF) reduced IR-induced G2 arrest and increased the level of apoptosis (1.5-1.6-fold) 24 h after treatment. Increased IR apoptotic cell death with CAF significantly reduced IR cell survival over a 7-day period in S/RG/C2 and PC/JW/FI. To investigate whether CAF radiosensitization correlated with lack of wild-type (wt) p53, we studied transfected derivatives of an adenoma-derived cell line (PC/AA/C1), in which the endogenous wt p53 activity was disrupted by the expression of a dominant negative (273Arg-->His) p53 mutant protein (designated AA/273p53/B). This p53-defective cell line was also radiosensitized by CAF, whereas the vector control (AA/PCMV/D), which retained wt p53 activity, was not. In addition, as with the S/RG/C2 and PC/JW/FI cell lines, the 7-day IR cell survival was reduced significantly in AA/273p53/B compared with the vector control cell line. This suggests that radiosensitization by CAF and increased cell death is dependent on loss of wt p53 function. Interestingly, radiosensitization of the AA/273p53/B cell line was not associated with accelerated apoptosis but correlated with increased polyploid giant cells, which have been associated with disruption of cell cycle checkpoints and genomic instability. These results demonstrate that G2 checkpoint inhibition with CAF leads to preferential IR cell killing in cell lines in which wt p53 is inactivated and that this increased cell killing is not necessarily dependent on increased IR-induced apoptosis.	0
Connexin-26 gene analysis in hearing-impaired newborns. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Deafness Female Genetic Testing Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Rhode Island Sequence Deletion || The efficacy and utility of the Connexin-26 (Cx-26) gene (also called GJB2) analysis from DNA isolated from Guthrie newborn screening cards is demonstrated. This analysis precisely defined a major cause of prelingual nonsyndromic deafness in those children requiring amplification in our study. Guthrie cards were obtained from 49 deaf children requiring amplification identified over the last 5 years by the Rhode Island Newborn Screening Program. Children with syndromes or other recognizable causes of hearing loss were excluded. DNA was extracted from the Guthrie cards and analyzed sequentially for the Cx-26 35delG mutation and then for the 167delT mutation followed by gene sequencing on remaining heterozygotes. Three of 42 children were 35delG homozygotes; 2/42 children were 35delG/167delT compound heterozygotes. One child was identified as being a 35delG heterozygote with no other mutation found by sequencing. Nine Guthrie cards yielded no amplification or uninterpretable results. Cx-26 mutations were identified as causing 11.9% of the deafness in the children studied. In conclusion, Cx-26 analysis is an important test that identifies a major cause of prelingual nonsyndromic deafness. Molecular analysis of hearing-impaired newborns will be important for genetic counseling in these families. Failures with Guthrie cards may make use of other collection methods preferable.	4
Merging perspectives: genotype-directed molecular therapy for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) and E-cadherin-EGFR crosstalk. ||  || Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline mutations of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1; NM_004360). Male CDH1 germline mutation carriers have by the age of 80 years an estimated 70% cumulative incidence of gastric cancer, females of 56% for gastric and of 42% for lobular breast cancer. Metastatic HDGC has a poor prognosis which is worse than for sporadic gastric cancer. To date, there have been no treatment options described tailored to this molecular subtype of gastric cancer. Here we review recent differential drug screening and gene expression results in c.1380del CDH1-mutant HDGC cells which identified drug classes targeting PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), FAK (focal adhesion kinase), PKC (protein kinase C), and TOPO2 (topoisomerase II) as selectively more effective in cells with defective CDH1 function. ERK1-ERK2 (extracellular signal regulated kinase) signaling measured as top enriched network in c.1380delA CDH1-mutant cells. We compared these findings to synthetic lethality and pharmacological screening results in isogenic CDH1-/- MCF10A mammary epithelial cells with and without CDH1 expression and current knowledge of E-cadherin/catenin-EGFR cross-talk, and suggest different rationales how loss of E-cadherin function activates PI3K, mTOR, EGFR, or FAK signaling. These leads represent molecularly selected treatment options tailored to the treatment of CDH1-deficient familial gastric cancer.	4
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) pseudogene expression in endometrial cancer: a conserved regulatory mechanism important in tumorigenesis? || Cell Line, Tumor Endometrial Neoplasms Female Humans MicroRNAs PTEN Phosphohydrolase Pseudogenes RNA, Messenger Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The PTEN pseudogene, PTENP1, was recently shown to play a role in cell proliferation in a prostate cancer model. In the present study, we sought to determine whether PTENP1 is expressed in endometrial cancer (EMCA) cell lines and primary tumors along with the microRNAs (miRNAs) that are predicted to regulate PTEN and PTENP1 transcript levels. RNA was prepared from six EMCA cell lines, three normal endometrial samples, and 61 primary tumors. TaqMan® RT-PCR was used to quantitate PTEN expression in all specimens and PTENP1 expression in cell lines, and normal endometrial (NE) samples. PTENP1 expression was evaluated using conventional RT-PCR in primary tumors. MicroRNA profiling was undertaken using NanoString(TM) technology in AN3CA and KLE cell lines. The relationship between PTEN transcript levels, PTENP1 expression, and PTEN mutation status was investigated. All NE samples, cell lines, and primary tumors expressed PTEN. PTENP1 transcript was expressed in NE, cell lines, and 34/61 (56%) primary tumors. The median relative PTEN level was 2.9 arbitrary expression units in PTENP1-positive tumors and 2.3 in PTENP1-negative tumors (p=0.09). PTEN levels in wild-type and haploinsufficient tumors were variable compared to PTEN-null tumors (p=0.015). Four microRNAs predicted to bind PTEN/PTENP1 ranked in the top 20 most abundant microRNA subtypes in the AN3CA and KLE cell lines. PTENP1 is expressed in NE and EMCA cell lines, as are PTEN/PTENP1 targeting inhibitory miRNAs (cell lines). Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of PTEN/PTENP1/miRNA interactions on tumorigenesis regulation in EMCA.	0
C.35delG/ GJB2 and del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutations in Croatians with prelingual non-syndromic hearing impairment. ||  || C.35delG/GJB2 mutation is the most frequent genetic cause of deafness in Caucasians. Another frequent mutation in some Caucasian populations is del(GJB6-D13S1830). Both GJB2 and GJB6 genes belong to the same DFNB1 locus and when the two mutations are found in combination in a hearing-impaired person, a digenic pattern of inheritance is suggested. We examined 63 Croatian subjects (25 familial and 38 sporadic cases) with prelingual non-syndromic hearing impairment by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the c.35delG/GJB2 and the del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutations. Of the 63 unrelated hearing-impaired subjects, the mutation c.35delG/GJB2 was found in 21 subjects (33.3%). In 5 of them the mutation was found in the heterozygous state, all of them being compound heterozygotes, as sequencing revealed a second mutation within the coding region of the gene in 3 subjects, and a splice site mutation in 2 subjects. The del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutation was not found in the investigated hearing-impaired Croatian subjects. Our results contribute to the knowledge of geographic distribution and population genetics of the GJB2 and GJB6 mutations in the Europeans.	4
Exome-wide association study reveals novel susceptibility genes to sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy. || Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Exome Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Mutation, Missense Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure with a strong familial component. We performed an exome-wide array-based association study (EWAS) to assess the contribution of missense variants to sporadic DCM. 116,855 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 2796 DCM patients and 6877 control subjects from 6 populations of European ancestry. We confirmed two previously identified associations with SNVs in BAG3 and ZBTB17 and discovered six novel DCM-associated loci (Q-value<0.01). The lead-SNVs at novel loci are common and located in TTN, SLC39A8, MLIP, FLNC, ALPK3 and FHOD3. In silico fine mapping identified HSPB7 as the most likely candidate at the ZBTB17 locus. Rare variant analysis (MAF<0.01) demonstrated significant association for TTN variants only (P = 0.0085). All candidate genes but one (SLC39A8) exhibit preferential expression in striated muscle tissues and mutations in TTN, BAG3, FLNC and FHOD3 are known to cause familial cardiomyopathy. We also investigated a panel of 48 known cardiomyopathy genes. Collectively, rare (n = 228, P = 0.0033) or common (n = 36, P = 0.019) variants with elevated in silico severity scores were associated with DCM, indicating that the spectrum of genes contributing to sporadic DCM extends beyond those identified here. We identified eight loci independently associated with sporadic DCM. The functions of the best candidate genes at these loci suggest that proteostasis regulation might play a role in DCM pathophysiology.	4
Target 5000: Target Capture Sequencing for Inherited Retinal Degenerations. ||  || There are an estimated 5000 people in Ireland who currently have an inherited retinal degeneration (IRD). It is the goal of this study, through genetic diagnosis, to better enable these 5000 individuals to obtain a clearer understanding of their condition and improved access to potentially applicable therapies. Here we show the current findings of a target capture next-generation sequencing study of over 750 patients from over 520 pedigrees currently situated in Ireland. We also demonstrate how processes can be implemented to retrospectively analyse patient datasets for the detection of structural variants in previously obtained sequencing reads. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were detected in 68% of pedigrees tested. We report nearly 30 novel mutations including three large structural variants. The population statistics related to our findings are presented by condition and credited to their respective candidate gene mutations. Rediagnosis rates of clinical phenotypes after genotyping are discussed. Possible causes of failure to detect a candidate mutation are evaluated. Future elements of this project, with a specific emphasis on structural variants and non-coding pathogenic variants, are expected to increase detection rates further and thereby produce an even more comprehensive representation of the genetic landscape of IRDs in Ireland.	4
Genetic basis of cardiomyopathy and the genotypes involved in prognosis and left ventricular reverse remodeling. || Adult Aged Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Connectin Female Heart Ventricles Humans Lamin Type A Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Ventricular Remodeling || Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. Cardiac function is improved after treatment in some cardiomyopathy patients, but little is known about genetic predictors of long-term outcomes and myocardial recovery following medical treatment. To elucidate the genetic basis of cardiomyopathy in Japan and the genotypes involved in prognosis and left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR), we performed targeted sequencing on 120 DCM (70 sporadic and 50 familial) and 52 HCM (15 sporadic and 37 familial) patients and integrated their genotypes with clinical phenotypes. Among the 120 DCM patients, 20 (16.7%) had TTN truncating variants and 13 (10.8%) had LMNA variants. TTN truncating variants were the major cause of sporadic DCM (21.4% of sporadic cases) as with Caucasians, whereas LMNA variants, which include a novel recurrent LMNA E115M variant, were the most frequent in familial DCM (24.0% of familial cases) unlike Caucasians. Of the 52 HCM patients, MYH7 and MYBPC3 variants were the most common (12 (23.1%) had MYH7 variants and 11 (21.2%) had MYBPC3 variants) as with Caucasians. DCM patients harboring TTN truncating variants had better prognosis than those with LMNA variants. Most patients with TTN truncating variants achieved LVRR, unlike most patients with LMNA variants.	4
Use of dedicated gene panel sequencing using next generation sequencing to improve the personalized care of lung cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Middle Aged Precision Medicine || Advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have improved the ability to detect potentially targetable mutations. However, the integration of NGS into clinical management in an individualized manner remains challenging. In this single-center observational study, we performed a dedicated NGS panel studying 41 cancer-related genes in 50 consecutive patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer between May 2012 and October 2014. Molecular analysis could be performed in 48 patients with a good quality check. One hundred and thirty-three mutations, whose twenty-four unique mutations, were detected. At least one mutation was found in 46 patients. In 58% of cases, the Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) was able to recommend treatment with a targeted agent based on the evaluation of the tumor genetic profile and treatment history. Nine patients (18%) were subsequently treated with a MTB-recommended targeted therapy; four patients experienced a clinical benefit with a partial response or stabilization lasting more than 4 months. In this case series involving patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, we show that including integrative clinical sequencing data into routine clinical management was feasible and could impact on patient therapeutic proposal.	4
Regulation of cytotoxic T-cell responses by p53 in cancer. ||  || An intriguing aspect of the tumor suppressor p53 is its ability to communicate to the adaptive immune system and control the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to cancer cells. Wild-type p53 (wtp53) communicates with CTLs through proteins involved in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation pathway [e.g., transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) and endoplasmic reticulum amino peptidase 1 (ERAP1)], the apoptosis signal receptor Fas/APO-1, and the inhibitory immune-checkpoint programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The presence of wtp53 in cancer cells ultimately promotes effector CTL-induced tumor cell death. Analogously, wtp53 in tumors unleashes the CTL response via inhibition of PD-L1 and enhances their effectiveness by upregulating Fas/APO-1 and MHC I. Given that p53 is mutated in approximately 50% of human cancers and also impacts the immunoreactivity of cancer cells, a significant number of patients can be affected by the impaired CTL response that results from non-functional p53. An attenuated CTL response due to p53 mutations could decrease response rates to immunotherapeutic drugs, leading to poor patient prognoses. This review article will summarize how p53 can regulate the cell-mediated adaptive immune response to cancer.	0
[Genotype and phenotype correlation of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency among patients from Henan]. ||  || To delineate the mutation spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene among patients affected with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAHD) in Henan Province of China, and to explore the correlation between the genotype and the phenotype. A total of 155 affected children were recruited. Potential mutation of the PAH gene were analyzed by direct sequencing. The genotype-phenotype correlation was analyzed by matching the expected and observed phenotypes. Over 72 mutations and 108 genotypes have been identified. There were 7 homozygous mutations, including 1 case with EX6-96A>G/EX6-96A>G, 1 with R241C/R241C, 1 with R413P/R413P, and 4 with R243Q/R243Q. Among these, 6 patients have presented classic PKU phenotypes, except for a R241C/R241C genotype which has led to mild PKU. In 104 patients carrying compound PAH mutations, 52 were classic, 34 were mild and 39 had mild HPA. Patients who were heterozygous for EX6-96A>G/R241C, R243Q/A434D, EX6-96A>G/R413P and EX6-96A>G/ R241C were found with both the classic PKU and mild PKU phenotypes. Common mutations associated with mild HPA have included R53H, R243Q, V399V and H107R. The common mutations associated with mild PKU included R243Q, R241C, EX6-96A>G, and IVS4-1G>A. The prevalent mutations in classic PKU were R243Q, EX6-96A>G and V399V. The consistency between prediction of the biochemical genotype and observed phenotype was 77.78%, especially in classic PKU, the consistency was up to 82.14%. Significant correlations were disclosed between pretreatment levels of phenylalanine and AV sum (r=-0.6729, P < 0.01). The mutation spectrum of PAH gene in Henan seems to differ from that of other regions. Independent assortment of mutant alleles may result in a complex genotype-phenotype correlation, but the genotypes of PAHD patients have correlated with the phenotype.	1 3
A rare coding allele in IFIH1 is protective for psoriatic arthritis. || Alleles Arthritis, Psoriatic Case-Control Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1 Logistic Models Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Principal Component Analysis Protective Factors || Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis. While many common risk alleles have been reported for association with PsA as well as psoriasis, few rare coding alleles have yet been identified. To identify rare coding variation associated with PsA risk or protection, we genotyped 41 267 variants with the exome chip and investigated association within an initial cohort of 1980 PsA cases and 5913 controls. Genotype data for an independent cohort of 2234 PsA cases and 5708 controls was also made available, allowing for a meta-analysis to be performed with the discovery dataset. We identified an association with the rare variant rs35667974 (p=2.39x10-6, OR=0.47), encoding an Ile923Val amino acid change in theIFIH1 gene protein product. The association was reproduced in our independent cohort, which reached a high level of significance on meta-analysis with the discovery and replication datasets (p=4.67x10-10). We identified a strong association withIFIH1 when performing multiple-variant analysis (p=6.77x10-6), and found evidence of independent effects between the rare allele and the common PsA variant at the same locus. For the first time, we report a rare coding allele in IFIH1 to be protective for PsA. This rare allele has also been identified to have the same direction of effect on type I diabetes and psoriasis. While this association further supports existing evidence forIFIH1 as a causal gene for PsA, mechanistic studies will need to be pursued to confirm thatIFIH1 is indeed causal.	4
Clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes associated with TP53 and BRAFNon-V600 mutations in cutaneous melanoma patients. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Child DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Melanoma Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Mutation Rate Neoplasm Staging Phenotype Prognosis Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Tumor Burden Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || BRAFV600 , NRAS, TP53, and BRAFNon-V600 are among the most common mutations detected in non-acral cutaneous melanoma patients. Although several studies have identified clinical and pathological features associated with BRAFV600 and NRAS mutations, limited data are available regarding the correlates and significance of TP53 and BRAFNon-V600 mutations. This study analyzed the patient demographics, primary tumor features, and clinical outcomes of a large cohort of non-acral cutaneous melanoma patients who had undergone clinically indicated molecular testing (n = 926). The prevalence of BRAFV600 , NRAS, TP53, and BRAFNon-V600 mutations was 43%, 21%, 19%, and 7%, respectively. The presence of a TP53 mutation was associated with older age (P = .019), a head and neck primary tumor site (P = .0001), and longer overall survival (OS) from the diagnosis of stage IV disease in univariate (P = .039) and multivariate analyses (P = .015). BRAFNon-V600 mutations were associated with older age (P = .005) but not with primary tumor features or OS from stage IV. Neither TP53 nor BRAFNon-V600 mutations correlated significantly with OS with frontline ipilimumab treatment, and the TP53 status was not significantly associated with outcomes with frontline BRAF inhibitor therapy. Eleven patients with BRAFNon-V600 mutations were treated with a BRAF inhibitor. Three patients were not evaluable for a response because of treatment cessation for toxicities; the remaining patients had disease progression as the best response to therapy. These results add to the understanding of the clinical features associated with TP53 and BRAFNon-V600 mutations in advanced cutaneous melanoma patients, and they support the rationale for evaluating the prognostic significance of TP53 in other cohorts of melanoma patients.

Transfection of wild-type but not mutant p53 induces early monocytic differentiation in HL60 cells and increases their sensitivity to stress. || Antigens, Surface Base Sequence Blood Proteins Cell Differentiation Cell Division Culture Media Dimethyl Sulfoxide Etoposide HL-60 Cells Humans Molecular Sequence Data Monocytes Sensitivity and Specificity Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || HL60 cells, which lack the p53 gene due to a deletion, were used as an in vitro model system to study the effect of wild-type p53 gene expression on hematopoietic differentiation. We transfected HL60 cells with wild-type p53 and two mutant p53 cDNAs encoding the Val to Ala mutation at codon 143 and the Arg to Trp mutation at codon 248. Flow cytometry, growth, and cytochemical analysis for alpha-napthyl butyrate esterase activity and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction indicated that wild-type p53 but not mutant p53 induced early monocytic differentiation in the transfected HL60 cells without terminal growth arrest. The wild-type p53 transfectants did not differentiate along the granulocytic pathway, even when induced with 1.25% DMSO for 6 days; rather, these cells resembled monocytic cells, confirming that wild-type p53 transfection caused these cells to become committed to differentiate along the monocytic pathway. HL60 cells transfected with wild-type p53 were more sensitive to stress, such as growth in serum-depleted medium and exposure to a chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide.	0
Longitudinal copy number, whole exome and targeted deep sequencing of 'good risk' IGHV-mutated CLL patients with progressive disease. || Adolescent Adult Aged Clone Cells Cytogenetic Analysis Disease Progression Exome Gene Dosage Genetic Heterogeneity High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell Longitudinal Studies Middle Aged Mutation Risk Young Adult || The biological features of IGHV-M chronic lymphocytic leukemia responsible for disease progression are still poorly understood. We undertook a longitudinal study close to diagnosis, pre-treatment and post relapse in 13 patients presenting with cMBL or Stage A disease and good-risk biomarkers (IGHV-M genes, no del(17p) or del(11q) and low CD38 expression) who nevertheless developed progressive disease, of whom 10 have required therapy. Using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number analysis together with whole exome, targeted deep- and Sanger sequencing at diagnosis, we identified mutations in established chronic lymphocytic leukemia driver genes in nine patients (69%), non-coding mutations (PAX5 enhancer region) in three patients and genomic complexity in two patients. Branching evolutionary trajectories predominated (n=9/13), revealing intra-tumoural epi- and genetic heterogeneity and sub-clonal competition before therapy. Of the patients subsequently requiring treatment, two had sub-clonal TP53 mutations that would not be detected by standard methodologies, three qualified for the very-low-risk category defined by integrated mutational and cytogenetic analysis and yet had established or putative driver mutations and one patient developed progressive, therapy-refractory disease associated with the emergence of an IGHV-U clone. These data suggest that extended genomic and immunogenetic screening may have clinical utility in patients with apparent good-risk disease.	4
Molecular spectrum of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in France. ||  || Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia (ADH), characterized by isolated elevation of plasmatic LDL cholesterol and premature cardiovascular complications, is associated with mutations in 3 major genes: LDLR (LDL receptor), APOB (apolipoprotein B) and PCSK9(proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9). Through the French ADH Research Network, we collected molecular data from 1358 French probands from eleven different regions in France.Mutations in the LDLR gene were identified in 1003 subjects representing 391 unique events with 46.0% missense, 14.6% frameshift, 13.6% splice, and 11.3% nonsense mutations, 9.7% major rearrangements, 3.8% small in frame deletions/insertions, and 1.0% UTR mutations. Interestingly,175 are novel mutational events and represent 45% of the unique events we identified, highlighting a specificity of the LDLR mutation spectrum in France. Furthermore, mutations in the APOB gene were identified in 89 probands and in the PCSK9 gene in 10 probands. Comparison of available clinical and biochemical data showed a gradient of severity for ADH-causing mutations:FH=PCSK9>FDB>«Others» genes. The respective contribution of each known gene to ADH inthis French cohort is: LDLR 73.9%, APOB 6.6%, PCSK9 0.7%. Finally, in 19.0% of the probands,no mutation was found, thus underscoring the existence of ADH mutations located in still unknown genes.	4
CD56 antigen expression and hemophagocytosis of leukemic cells in acute myeloid leukemia with t(16;21)(p11;q22). || Adult CD56 Antigen Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16 Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21 Cytophagocytosis Female Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Male Middle Aged Prognosis Translocation, Genetic Young Adult || The translocation t(16;21)(p11;q22) is rare, occurs with an incidence of 1%, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), forming TLS/FUS-ERG fusion transcript, and it is known to cause the hemophagocytosis and vacuolation of leukemic cells. As previously reported cases numbered less than 60, we aimed to identify the clinical and genetic aspects of AML with t(16;21). Among 1,277 patients diagnosed with de novo and secondary AML, 12 AML patients with t(16;21) were retrospectively evaluated (0.94%, 12/1,277). AML with t(16;21) expressed CD56 with a median value of 45% (7.8-87%), and the rate of hemophagocytosis plus vacuolation of leukemic cells was 2.9% (2.0-9.0%). CD56 antigen expression showed a correlation with the total rate of hemophagocytosis plus vacuolation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.663 (P = 0.019). AML with t(16;21) expressed CD13, CD33, CD34, CD117, CD56, HLA-DR, and cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase. RUNX1, which regulates a gene for hematopoiesis, is frequently mutated in AML and, in this study, one out of three patients showed the mutation R174Q in RUNX1. All of these 3 patients showed the fusion transcript TLS/FUS-ERG, which was detected by multiplex or nested PCR. AML with t(16;21) showed a very low rate of complete remission after induction chemotherapy (8.3%), and high relapse (75%) and mortality (75%) rates. AML with t(16;21) exhibited a distinct morphology with frequent CD56 expression and a poor prognosis.	4
The high frequency of GJB2 gene mutation c.313_326del14 suggests its possible origin in ancestors of Lithuanian population. || Alleles Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Cross-Sectional Studies European Continental Ancestry Group Female Gene Deletion Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Genetic Loci Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Lithuania Logistic Models Male Mutation Sequence Analysis, DNA || Congenital hearing loss (CHL) is diagnosed in 1 - 2 newborns in 1000, genetic factors contribute to two thirds of CHL cases in industrialised countries. Mutations of the GJB2 gene located in the DFNB1 locus (13q11-12) are a major cause of CHL worldwide. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the contribution of the DFNB1 locus containing the GJB2 and GJB6 genes in the development of early onset hearing loss in the affected group of participants, to determine the population-specific mutational profile and DFNB1-related HL burden in Lithuanian population. Clinical data were obtained from a collection of 158 affected participants (146 unrelated probands) with early onset non-syndromic HL. GJB2 and GJB6 gene sequencing and GJB6 gene deletion testing were performed. The data of GJB2 and GJB6 gene sequencing in 98 participants in group of self-reported healthy Lithuanian inhabitants were analysed. Statistic summary, homogeneity tests, and logistic regression analysis were used for the assessment of genotype-phenotype correlation. Our findings show 57.5% of affected participants with two pathogenic GJB2 gene mutations identified. The most prevalent GJB2 mutations were c.35delG, p. (Gly12Valfs*2) (rs80338939) and c.313_326del14, p. (Lys105Glyfs*5) (rs111033253) with allele frequencies 64.7% and 28.3% respectively. GJB6 gene mutations were not identified in the affected group of participants. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences between GJB2(-) and GJB2(+) groups in disease severity (p = 0.001), and family history (p = 0.01). The probability of identification of GJB2 mutations in patients with various HL characteristics was estimated. The carrier rate of GJB2 gene mutations - 7.1% (~1 in 14) was identified in the group of healthy participants and a high frequency of GJB2-related hearing loss was estimated in our population. The results show a very high proportion of GJB2-positive individuals in the research group affected with sensorineural HL. The allele frequency of c.35delG mutation (64.7 %) is consistent with many previously published studies in groups of affected individuals of Caucasian populations. The high frequency of the c.313_326del14 (28.3 % of pathogenic alleles) mutation in affected group of participants was an unexpected finding in our study suggesting not only a high frequency of carriers of this mutation in our population but also its possible origin in Lithuanian ancestors. The high frequency of carriers of the c.313_326del14 mutation in the entire Lithuanian population is supported by it being identified twice in the ethnic Lithuanian group of healthy participants (a frequency 2.0 % of carriers in the study group). Analysis of the allele frequency of GJB2 gene mutations revealed a high proportion of c. 313_326del14 (rs111033253) mutations in the GJB2-positive group suggesting its possible origin in Lithuanian forebears. The high frequency of carriers of GJB2 gene mutations in the group of healthy participants corresponds to the substantial frequency of GJB2-associated HL in Lithuania. The observations of the study indicate the significant contribution of GJB2 gene mutations to the pathogenesis of the disorder in the Lithuanian population and will contribute to introducing principles to predict the characteristics of the disease in patients.	4
Cancer-derived p53 mutants suppress p53-target gene expression--potential mechanism for gain of function of mutant p53. || Apoptosis Binding Sites Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Down-Regulation Enzyme Inhibitors Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Humans Hydroxamic Acids Mutation Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA Interference Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumour-derived p53 mutants are thought to have acquired 'gain-of-function' properties that contribute to oncogenicity. We have tested the hypothesis that p53 mutants suppress p53-target gene expression, leading to enhanced cellular growth. Silencing of mutant p53 expression in several human cell lines was found to lead to the upregulation of wild-type p53-target genes such as p21, gadd45, PERP and PTEN. The expression of these genes was also suppressed in H1299-based isogenic cell lines expressing various hot-spot p53 mutants, and silencing of mutant p53, but not TAp73, abrogated the suppression. Consistently, these hot-spot p53 mutants were able to suppress a variety of p53-target gene promoters. Analysis using the proto-type p21 promoter construct indicated that the p53-binding sites are dispensable for mutant p53-mediated suppression. However, treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A resulted in relief of mutant p53-mediated suppression, suggesting that mutant p53 may induce hypo-acetylation of target gene promoters leading to the suppressive effects. Finally, we show that stable down-regulation of mutant p53 expression resulted in reduced cellular colony growth in human cancer cells, which was found to be due to the induction of apoptosis. Together, the results demonstrate another mechanism through which p53 mutants could promote cellular growth.	0
Retrospective mutational analysis of NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 and LAMB2 in children with steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis - a single-centre experience. || Adolescent Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Female Genes, Wilms Tumor Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental Humans Infant Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Laminin Male Membrane Proteins Mutation Retrospective Studies Sex Factors WT1 Proteins || The aim of our study was to examine NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 and LAMB2 mutations, previously reported in two thirds of patients with nephrotic syndrome with onset before the age of one year old. Genomic DNA samples from Polish children (n=33) with Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS) due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), manifesting before the age of 13 years old, underwent retrospective analysis of NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1 (exons 8, 9 and adjacent exon/intron boundaries) and LAMB2. No pathogenic NPHS1 or LAMB2 mutations were found in our FSGS cohort. SRNS-causing mutations of NPHS2 and WT1 were detected in 7 of 33 patients (21%), including those with nephrotic syndrome manifesting before one year old: five of seven patients. Four patients had homozygous c.413G>A (p.Arg138Gln) NPHS2 mutations; one subject was homozygous for c.868G>A (p.Val290Met) NPHS2. A phenotypic female had C>T transition at position +4 of the WT1 intron 9 (c.1432+4C>T) splice-donor site, and another phenotypic female was heterozygous for G>A transition at position +5 (c.1432+5G>A). Genotyping revealed a female genotypic gender (46, XX) for the first subject and male (46, XY) for the latter. In addition, one patient was heterozygous for c.104dup (p.Arg36Profs*34) NPHS2; two patients carried a c.686G>A (p.Arg229Gln) NPHS2 non-neutral variant. Results indicate possible clustering of causative NPHS2 mutations in FSGS-proven SRNS with onset before age one year old, and provide additional evidence that patients with childhood steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis should first undergo analysis of NPHS2 coding sequence and WT1 exons 8 and 9 and surrounding exon/intron boundary sequences, followed by gender genotyping.	4
Validation and Application of a Custom-Designed Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Panel for the Diagnostic Mutational Profiling of Solid Tumors. || High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Limit of Detection Mutation Neoplasms Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity || The inevitable switch from standard molecular methods to next-generation sequencing for the molecular profiling of tumors is challenging for most diagnostic laboratories. However, fixed validation criteria for diagnostic accreditation are not in place because of the great variability in methods and aims. Here, we describe the validation of a custom panel of hotspots in 24 genes for the detection of somatic mutations in non-small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma and malignant melanoma starting from FFPE sections, using 14, 36 and 5 cases, respectively. The targeted hotspots were selected for their present or future clinical relevance in solid tumor types. The target regions were enriched with the TruSeq approach starting from limited amounts of DNA. Cost effective sequencing of 12 pooled libraries was done using a micro flow cell on the MiSeq and subsequent data analysis with MiSeqReporter and VariantStudio. The entire workflow was diagnostically validated showing a robust performance with maximal sensitivity and specificity using as thresholds a variant allele frequency >5% and a minimal amplicon coverage of 300. We implemented this method through the analysis of 150 routine diagnostic samples and identified clinically relevant mutations in 16 genes including KRAS (32%), TP53 (32%), BRAF (12%), APC (11%), EGFR (8%) and NRAS (5%). Importantly, the highest success rate was obtained when using also the low quality DNA samples. In conclusion, we provide a workflow for the validation of targeted NGS by a custom-designed pan-solid tumor panel in a molecular diagnostic lab and demonstrate its robustness in a clinical setting.	4
Correlation between audiometric data and the 35delG mutation in ten patients. || Adolescent Adult Audiometry Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Cross-Sectional Studies Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Phenotype Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index || Mutations in the connexin 26 gene seem to be extremely common in non-syndromic hereditary deafness genesis, especially the 35delG, but there are still only a few studies that describe the audiometric characteristics of patients with these mutations. to analyze the audiometric characteristics of patients with mutations in the connexin 26 gene in order to outline genotype-phenotype correlation. Tonal audiometries of 33 index cases of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated and eight affected relatives. Specific molecular tests were carried out to analyze mutations in the connexin 26 gene. Retrospective, cross-sectional study. A 27.3% prevalence of mutation 35delG was found in the index cases and 12.5% among the relatives affected. In relation to hearing loss degree, 41.5% of the patients were found with profound hearing loss, 39% with severe HL and 19.5% with moderate HL with homozygote and heterozygote patients for the 35delG predominating in the severe-moderate hearing losses. Our results suggest that the audiometric data associated with the molecular diagnose of hearing loss helped us to outline a genotype-phenotype correlation in ten patients with 35delG mutation. However, it is still necessary to run multicentric studies to verify the real phenotypic expression in the Brazilian population, as far as the 35delG mutation is concerned.	4
Aggregation tendencies in the p53 family are modulated by backbone hydrogen bonds. || Amino Acid Sequence Humans Hydrogen Bonding Multigene Family Pressure Protein Aggregates Protein Denaturation Protein Domains Protein Stability Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 family of proteins is comprised of p53, p63 and p73. Because the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD) is naturally unstable and possesses an amyloidogenic sequence, it is prone to form amyloid fibrils, causing loss of functions. To develop p53 therapies, it is necessary to understand the molecular basis of p53 instability and aggregation. Light scattering, thioflavin T (ThT) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) assays showed that p53 DBD aggregates faster and to a greater extent than p63 and p73 DBDs, and was more susceptible to denaturation. The aggregation tendencies of p53, p63, and p73 DBDs were strongly correlated with their thermal stabilities. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations indicated specific regions of structural heterogeneity unique to p53, which may be promoted by elevated incidence of exposed backbone hydrogen bonds (BHBs). The results indicate regions of structural vulnerability in the p53 DBD, suggesting new targetable sites for modulating p53 stability and aggregation, a potential approach to cancer therapy.	0
Prenatal molecular diagnosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: report of the first case. ||  || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant disease that may cause premature sudden death, especially in teenagers and young adults. The recent progress in the molecular genetics of the disease has made genetic testing sometimes available in clinical practice. We report the case of a couple who still requested prenatal molecular testing after detailed information had been given through a multidisciplinary consultation. Prenatal diagnosis in HCM is associated with complex medical and psychological implications, in addition to general ethical considerations, as the potential value of the diagnosis is counterbalanced by the highly variable expression of the disease and the difficulty in predicting its evolution. The R403L mutation in the MYH7 gene had been previously identified in this family, characterized by a malignant form of HCM. In the specific context of this case, we decided to agree to the request of the parents and performed the prenatal diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a prenatal molecular diagnosis performed in the context of HCM.	4
Evaluation of an Actinomycin D/VX-680 aurora kinase inhibitor combination in p53-based cyclotherapy. || Aneugens Aneuploidy Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Aurora Kinases Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cytoprotection Dactinomycin Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Gene Knockout Techniques Genes, p53 HCT116 Cells Humans Imidazoles Neoplasms Piperazines Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases || p53-Based cyclotherapy is proving to be a promising approach to palliate undesired effects of chemotherapy in patients with tumours carrying p53 mutations. For example, pre-treatment of cell cultures with Nutlin-3, a highly-selective inhibitor of the p53-mdm2 interaction, has been successfully used as a cytostatic agent to protect normal cells, but not p53-defective cells, from subsequent treatment with mitotic poisons or S-phase specific drugs. Here we sought to evaluate whether low doses of Actinomycin D (LDActD), a clinically-approved drug and potent p53 activator, could substitute Nutlin-3 in p53-based cyclotherapy. We found that pre-treatment with LDActD before adding the aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 protects normal fibroblasts from polyploidy and nuclear morphology abnormalities induced by VX-680. However, and although to a lower extent than normal fibroblasts, tumour cell lines bearing p53 mutations were also protected by LDActD (but not Nutlin-3) from VX-680-induced polyploidy. We also report that a difference between the response of p53 wild-type cells and p53-defective cells to the LDActD/VX-680 sequential combination is that only the former fail to enter S-phase and therefore accumulate in G1/G0. We propose that drugs that incorporate into DNA during S-phase may perform better as second drugs than mitotic poisons in cyclotherapy approaches using LDActD as a cytostatic agent.	0
Immunohistochemistry as a potential tool for routine detection of the NRAS Q61R mutation in patients with metastatic melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antibodies, Monoclonal Cohort Studies Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Retrospective Studies Skin Neoplasms || It can be useful to assess the NRAS mutation status in patients with metastatic melanoma because NRAS-activating mutations confer resistance to RAF inhibitors, and NRAS-mutated patients appear to be sensitive to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of an immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach using a novel anti-NRAS (Q61R) monoclonal antibody on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients with metastatic melanoma. We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study on 170 patients with metastatic melanoma. The automated IHC assay was performed using the SP174 clone, and compared with results of the molecular testing. Evaluation of a test cohort with knowledge of the mutation status established a specific IHC pattern for the mutation. In the independent blinded analysis of the remaining cases, the anti-NRAS (Q61R) antibody accurately identified all NRAS Q61R-mutated tumors, and demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity. Limitations include retrospective design and lack of multicenter interobserver reproducibility. The NRAS (Q61R) IHC assay is reliable and specific for the evaluation of the Q61R mutation status in metastatic melanoma and may be an alternative to molecular biology in evaluation of metastatic melanoma in routine practice.	4
Mutation Analysis in Classical Phenylketonuria Patients Followed by Detecting Haplotypes Linked to Some PAH Mutations. ||  || Deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme and elevation of phenylalanine in body fluids cause phenylketonuria (PKU). The gold standard for confirming PKU and PAH deficiency is detecting causal mutations by direct sequencing of the coding exons and splicing involved sequences of the PAH gene. Furthermore, haplotype analysis could be considered as an auxiliary approach for detecting PKU causative mutations before direct sequencing of the PAH gene by making comparisons between prior detected mutation linked-haplotypes and new PKU case haplotypes with undetermined mutations. In this study, 13 unrelated classical PKU patients took part in the study detecting causative mutations. Mutations were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing in all patients. After that, haplotype analysis was performed by studying VNTR and PAHSTR markers (linked genetic markers of the PAH gene) through application of PCR and capillary electrophoresis (CE). Mutation analysis was performed successfully and the detected mutations were as follows: c.782G>A, c.754C>T, c.842C>G, c.113-115delTCT, c.688G>A, and c.696A>G. Additionally, PAHSTR/VNTR haplotypes were detected to discover haplotypes linked to each mutation. Mutation detection is the best approach for confirming PAH enzyme deficiency in PKU patients. Due to the relatively large size of the PAH gene and high cost of the direct sequencing in developing countries, haplotype analysis could be used before DNA sequencing and mutation detection for a faster and cheaper way via identifying probable mutated exons.	1 3
Fully automated sample preparation microsystem for genetic testing of hereditary hearing loss using two-color multiplex allele-specific PCR. || Alleles Connexins DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Equipment Design Genetic Testing Hearing Loss Humans Lab-On-A-Chip Devices Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction || A fully automated microsystem consisting of a disposable DNA extraction and PCR microchip, as well as a compact control instrument, has been successfully developed for genetic testing of hereditary hearing loss from human whole blood. DNA extraction and PCR were integrated into a single 15-μL reaction chamber, where a piece of filter paper was embedded for capturing genomic DNA, followed by in-situ PCR amplification without elution. Diaphragm microvalves actuated by external solenoids together with a "one-way" fluidic control strategy operated by a modular valve positioner and a syringe pump were employed to control the fluids and to seal the chamber during thermal cycling. Fully automated DNA extractions from as low as 0.3-μL human whole blood followed by amplifications of 59-bp β-actin fragments can be completed on the microsystem in about 100 min. Negative control tests that were performed between blood sample analyses proved the successful elimination of any contamination or carryover in the system. To more critically test the microsystem, a two-color multiplex allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) assay for detecting c.176_191del16, c.235delC, and c.299_300delAT mutations in GJB2 gene that accounts for hereditary hearing loss was constructed. Two allele-specific primers, one labeled with TAMRA for wild type and the other with FAM for mutation, were designed for each locus. DNA extraction from blood and ASPCR were performed on the microsystem, followed by an electrophoretic analysis on a portable microchip capillary electrophoresis system. Blood samples from a healthy donor and five persons with genetic mutations were all accurately analyzed with only two steps in less than 2 h.	4
The first Mongolian cases of phenylketonuria in selective screening of inborn errors of metabolism. ||  || Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are rare genetic disorders in which a single gene defect causes a clinically significant block in a metabolic pathway. Clinical problems arise due to either accumulation of substrates that are toxic or interfere with normal function, or deficiency of the products that are used to synthesize essential compounds. There is no report of screening results or confirmed cases of IEM in Mongolia. Only pilot study of newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism was implemented in Mongolia, where the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is calculated to be 1:3057 in Mongolia. Two hundred twenty-three Mongolian patients, who had developmental delay, psychomotor retardation with unknown cause, seizures, hypotonia or liver dysfunction, were studied. Urinary organic acid analysis was performed in all cases using gas chromatography mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis. Blood amino acids and acylcarnitines were checked in the patients who had abnormal GC/MS analyses. Mutation analysis was done in the patients, who were suspected having specific inborn errors of metabolism by mass spectrometric analysis. One hundred thirty-nine children had normal urinary organic acid analyses. Thirty one had metabolites of valproic acid, 17 had non- or hypoketotic dicarboxylic aciduria, 14 had tyrosiluria, 12 had ketosis, 4 had elevation of lactate and pyruvate, 3 had increased excretion of urinary glycerol or methylmalonic acids, respectively, and 2 had elevation of phenylacetate and phenyllactate. We checked blood amino acids and acylcarnitines in 38 patients, which revealed phenylketonuria (PKU) in 2 patients, and one with suspected citrin deficiency. Mutation analysis in PAH was done in 2 patients with PKU, and previously reported p.R243Q, p.Y356X, p.V399V, p.A403V mutations were detected. In conclusion, these were the first genetically confirmed cases of PKU in Mongolia, and the study suggested that the newborn screening program for PKU was significant because it enabled early treatment dietary restriction, specialized formulas and other medical management for prevention of neurological handicaps in these children.	1 3
Tailoring Chemotherapy for the African-Centric S47 Variant of TP53. ||  || The tumor suppressor TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and serves to restrict tumor initiation and progression. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) inTP53 andp53 pathway genes can have a marked impact on p53 tumor suppressor function, and some have been associated with increased cancer risk and impaired response to therapy. Approximately 6% of Africans and 1% of African Americans express a p53 allele with a serine instead of proline at position 47 (Pro47Ser). This SNP impairs p53-mediated apoptosis in response to radiation and genotoxic agents and is associated with increased cancer risk in humans and in a mouse model. In this study, we compared the ability of wild-type (WT) and S47 p53 to suppress tumor development and respond to therapy. Our goal was to find therapeutic compounds that are more, not less, efficacious in S47 tumors. We identified the superior efficacy of two agents, cisplatin and BET inhibitors, on S47 tumors compared with WT. Cisplatin caused dramatic decreases in the progression of S47 tumors by activating the p53/PIN1 axis to drive the mitochondrial cell death program. These findings serve as important proof of principle that chemotherapy can be tailored to p53 genotype.Significance: A rare African-derived radioresistant p53 SNP provides proof of principle that chemotherapy can be tailored to TP53 genotype.Cancer Res; 78(19); 5694-705. ©2018 AACR.	0
The rare Costello variant HRAS c.173C>T (p.T58I) with severe neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Abnormalities, Multiple Alleles Biomarkers Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Costello Syndrome DNA Mutational Analysis Echocardiography Genetic Association Studies Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Radiography, Thoracic Severity of Illness Index || We report a 10-year-old girl presenting with severe neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), feeding difficulties, mildly abnormal facial features, and progressive skeletal muscle symptoms but with normal cognitive development. Targeted oligonucleotide-selective sequencing of 101 cardiomyopathy genes revealed the genetic diagnosis, and the mutation was verified by Sanger sequencing in the patient and her parents. To offer insights into the potential mechanism of patient mutation, protein structural analysis was performed using the resolved structure of human activated HRAS protein with bound GTP analogue (PDB id 5P21) in Discovery Studio 4.5 (Dassault Systèmes Biovia, San Diego, CA). The patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and normal cognitive development was diagnosed with an HRAS mutation c.173C>T (p.T58I), a milder variant of Costello syndrome affecting a highly conserved amino acid, threonine 58. Our analysis suggests that the p.G12 mutations slow GTP hydrolysis rendering HRAS unresponsive to GTPase activating proteins, and resulting in permanently active state. The p.T58I mutation likely affects binding of guanidine-nucleotide-exchange factors, thereby promoting the active state but also allowing for slow inactivation. Patients with the HRAS mutation c.173C>T (p.T58I) might go undiagnosed because of the milder phenotype compared with other mutations causing Costello syndrome. We expand the clinical and molecular picture of the rare HRAS mutation by reporting the first case in Europe and the fourth case in the literature. Our protein structure analysis offers insights into the mechanism of the mildly activating p.T58I mutation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	4
Spatio-temporal mutation profiles of case-matched colorectal carcinomas and their metastases reveal unique de novo mutations in metachronous lung metastases by targeted next generation sequencing. || Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Library Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Liver Neoplasms Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) has become part of molecular pathology diagnostics for determining RAS mutation status in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients as predictive tool for decision on EGFR-targeted therapy. Here, we investigated mutation profiles of case-matched tissue specimens throughout the disease course of CRC, to further specify RAS-status dynamics and to identify de novo mutations associated with distant metastases. Case-matched formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) resection specimens (n = 70; primary tumours, synchronous and/or metachronous liver and/or lung metastases) of 14 CRC cases were subjected to microdissection of normal colonic epithelial, primary and metastatic tumour cells, their DNA extraction and an adapted library protocol for limited DNA using the 48 gene TruSeq Amplicon Cancer PanelTM, MiSeq sequencing and data analyses (Illumina). By tNGS primary tumours were RAS wildtype in 5/14 and mutated in 9/14 (8/9 KRAS exon 2; 1/9 NRAS Exon 3) of cases. RAS mutation status was maintained in case-matched metastases throughout the disease course, albeit with altered allele frequencies. Case-matched analyses further identified a maximum of three sequence variants (mainly in APC, KRAS, NRAS, TP53) shared by all tumour specimens throughout the disease course per individual case. In addition, further case-matched de novo mutations were detected in synchronous and/or metachronous liver and/or lung metastases (e.g. in APC, ATM, FBXW7, FGFR3, GNAQ, KIT, PIK3CA, PTEN, SMAD4, SMO, STK11, TP53, VHL). Moreover, several de novo mutations were more frequent in synchronous (e.g. ATM, KIT, PIK3CA, SMAD4) or metachronous (e.g. FBXW7, SMO, STK11) lung metastases. Finally, some de novo mutations occurred only in metachronous lung metastases (CDKN2A, FGFR2, GNAS, JAK3, SRC). Together, this study employs an adapted FFPE-based tNGS approach to confirm conservation of RAS mutation status in primary and metastatic tissue specimens of CRC patients. Moreover, it identifies genes preferentially mutated de novo in late disease stages of metachronous CRC lung metastases, several of which might be actionable by targeted therapies.	4
HDACi inhibits liposarcoma via targeting of the MDM2-p53 signaling axis and PTEN, irrespective of p53 mutational status. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Humans Hydroxamic Acids Imidazoles Indoles Liposarcoma Molecular Targeted Therapy PTEN Phosphohydrolase Panobinostat Piperazines Point Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Signal Transduction Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The MDM2-p53 pathway plays a prominent role in well-differentiated liposarcoma (LPS) pathogenesis. Here, we explore the importance of MDM2 amplification and p53 mutation in LPS independently, to determine whether HDACi are therapeutically useful in LPS. We demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of MDM2 and p53 in p53-mutant LPS lines resulted in increased apoptosis, anti-proliferative effects, and cell cycle arrest, as compared to either intervention alone. HDACi treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and depletion of MDM2 and p53 without affecting CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in MDM2-amplified LPS. In control mesothelioma cell lines, HDACi treatment resulted in down-regulation of p53 in the p53 mutant cell line JMN1B, but resulted in no changes of MDM2 and p53 in two mesothelioma lines with normal MDM2 and wild-type p53. HDACi treatment substantially decreased LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival, and was associated with upregulation of PTEN and p21, and inactivation of AKT. Our findings indicate that wild-type p53 depletion by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. These findings underscore the importance of targeting both MDM2 and p53 in LPS and other cancers harboring p53 mutations. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effect of HDACi warrants further evaluation as a therapeutic strategy in MDM2-amplified LPS.	0
A fluorescent multiplex ARMS method for rapid mutation analysis. || Alleles Base Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Fluorescent Dyes Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Testing Humans Molecular Sequence Data Northern Ireland Phenylalanine Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid || The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) is a powerful technique for the identification of mutations. We present a modification of this technique involving coamplification of normal and mutant alleles with primers that differ in length by three to five bases. Fluorescent labelling allows exact sizing of the amplification products on an automated DNA fragment analyser. We have used the fluorescent multiplex ARMS method for the identification of common phenylketonuria mutations in Northern Ireland (R408W, 165T and F39L) together with the analysis of a polymorphic short tandem repeat site at the human phenylalanine hydroxylase locus. This provides an efficient and inexpensive first step for diagnostic mutation analysis in our population.	3
A genotype-phenotype correlation in Sicilian patients with GJB2 biallelic mutations. || Audiometry Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Genetic Association Studies Genotype Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Severity of Illness Index Sicily Young Adult || The aim of this work was to study the genotype distribution of Sicilian patients with biallelic GJB2 mutations; to correlate genotype classes and/or specific mutations of GJB2 gene (35delG-non-35delG) with audiologic profiles. A total of 10 different mutations and 11 different genotypes were evidenced in 73 SNHL subjects; 35delG (90.36 % of cases) and IVS1+1 (13.69 %) were the most common mutations found in the cohort with a significant difference in the distribution between North and South Sicily. Audiological evaluation revealed a severe (16/73) to profound (47/73) hearing loss (HL) in 86.13 % of cases without significant difference between the degree of HL and the province of origin of the subjects (P = 0.727). The homozygous truncating (T/T) genotype was the most widespread (89.04 % of cases), with a severe-to-profound hearing impairment in 90.36 % of T/T class with respect to truncating/non-truncating (T/NT) and non-truncating/non-truncating (NT/NT) genotypes (P = 0.012). From the comparison of homozygous 35delG and 35delG/non-35delG genotypes, a more profound HL in the homozygous 35delG than in compound heterozygous 35delG/non-35delG (p < 0.0001) resulted. This study confirms that 35delG is the most common mutation in the Mediterranean area with a heterogeneous distribution of the genotypes between North and South Sicily; probands homozygotes for 35delG or presenting a T/T genotype are more apt to have a severe-to-profound HL.	4
Analysis of neurodegenerative Mendelian genes in clinically diagnosed Alzheimer Disease. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Case-Control Studies Female Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Mutation Parkinson Disease Pedigree Presenilin-1 Protein Kinases || Alzheimer disease (AD), Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson disease (PD) have a certain degree of clinical, pathological and molecular overlap. Previous studies indicate that causative mutations in AD and FTD/ALS genes can be found in clinical familial AD. We examined the presence of causative and low frequency coding variants in the AD, FTD, ALS and PD Mendelian genes, in over 450 families with clinical history of AD and over 11,710 sporadic cases and cognitive normal participants from North America. Known pathogenic mutations were found in 1.05% of the sporadic cases, in 0.69% of the cognitively normal participants and in 4.22% of the families. A trend towards enrichment, albeit non-significant, was observed for most AD, FTD and PD genes. Only PSEN1 and PINK1 showed consistent association with AD cases when we used ExAC as the control population. These results suggest that current study designs may contain heterogeneity and contamination of the control population, and that current statistical methods for the discovery of novel genes with real pathogenic variants in complex late onset diseases may be inadequate or underpowered to identify genes carrying pathogenic mutations.	4
Disease modeling and lentiviral gene transfer in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells from late-onset Pompe disease patient. ||  || Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disease caused by deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA). Glycogen accumulation is seen in the affected organ such as skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is frequently seen in the infantile onset Pompe disease. On the other hand, cardiovascular complication of the late-onset Pompe disease is considered as less frequent and severe than that of infantile onset. There are few investigations which show cardiovascular complication of late onset Pompe disease due to the shortage of appropriate disease model. We have generated late-onset Pompe disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and differentiated them into cardiomyocytes. Differentiated cardiomyocyte shows glycogen accumulation and lysosomal enlargement. Lentiviral GAA rescue improves GAA enzyme activity and glycogen accumulation in iPSC. The efficacy of gene therapy is maintained following the cardiomyocyte differentiation. Lentiviral GAA transfer ameliorates the disease-specific change in cardiomyocyote. It is suggested that Pompe disease iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte is replicating disease-specific changes in the context of disease modeling, drug screening, and cell therapy.	1
Frequent inactivating germline mutations in DNA repair genes in patients with Ewing sarcoma. ||  || Ewing sarcoma is a small round blue cell tumor that is highly malignant and predominantly affects the adolescent and young adult population. It has long been suspected that a genetic predisposition exists for this cancer, but the germ-line genetic underpinnings of this disease have not been well established. We performed germline variant analysis of whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing of samples from 175 patients affected by Ewing sarcoma. We discovered pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations in 13.1% of our cohort. Pathogenic mutations were highly enriched for genes involved with DNA damage repair and for genes associated with cancer predisposition syndromes. Our findings reported here have important clinical implications for patients and families affected by Ewing sarcoma. Genetic counseling should be considered for patients and families affected by this disease to take advantage of existing risk management strategies. Our study also highlights the importance of germline sequencing for patients enrolled in precision-medicine protocols.Genet Med advance online publication 26 January 2017.	4
Regulation of CEACAM1 Protein Expression by the Transcription Factor ETS-1 in BRAF-Mutant Human Metastatic Melanoma Cells. || Antigens, CD Cell Adhesion Molecules Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Down-Regulation Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Indoles MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf RNA, Messenger Sulfonamides T-Lymphocytes Transcription Factors Vemurafenib || BRAF becomes constitutively activated in 50% to 70% of melanoma cases. CEACAM1 has a dual role in melanoma, including facilitation of cell proliferation and suppression of infiltrating lymphocytes, which are consistent with its value as a marker for poor prognosis in melanoma patients. Here we show that BRAFV600E melanoma cells treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (MAPKi) downregulate CEACAM1 mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and exposure time-dependent manners. Indeed, there is a significant correlation between the presence of BRAFV600E and CEACAM1 expression in melanoma specimens obtained from 45 patients. Vemurafenib-resistant cell systems reactivate the MAPK pathway and restore basal CEACAM1 mRNA and protein levels. These combined results suggest transcriptional regulation. Indeed, luciferase reporting assays show that CEACAM1 promoter (CEACAM1p) activity is significantly reduced by MAPKi. Importantly, we show that the MAPK-driven CEACAM1p activity is mediated by ETS1, a major transcription factor and downstream effector of the MAPK pathway. Phosphorylation mutant ETS1T38A shows a dominant negative effect over CEACAM1 expression. The data are consistent with independent RNAseq data from serial biopsies of melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors, which demonstrate similar CEACAM1 downregulation. Finally, we show that CEACAM1 downregulation by MAPKi renders the cells more sensitive to T-cell activation. These results provide a new view on a potential immunological mechanism of action of MAPKi in melanoma, as well as on the aggressive phenotype observed in drug-resistant cells.	0

Determination of the carrier frequency of the common GJB2 (connexin-26) 35delG mutation in the Greek Cypriot population. || Adult Connexin 26 Connexins Cyprus Deafness Frameshift Mutation Genetics, Population Heterozygote Humans Poisson Distribution || Mutations in the GJB2 (connexin-26) gene are responsible for more than half of all cases of prelingual recessive inherited non-syndromic deafness in Europe. One specific mutation 35delG, accounts for up to 70% of the mutations detected in European populations and is one of the most frequent disease mutations identified so far. The aim of this study is to determine the percentage of carriers of this mutation in the Greek Cypriot population. Genomic DNA was isolated from a total of 405 healthy unrelated Greek Cypriot adults. Screening for the frameshift 35delG mutation was performed by using an allele-specific PCR protocol. Moreover, using the Poisson probability distribution, we compared the carrier frequencies of the 35delG mutation of the Greek Cypriot population to the various European and Middle Eastern populations. The carrier frequency in the Greek Cypriot population was estimated to be 2.5% and is similar to that observed in other European populations. The variance estimate for 35delG mutation produces slightly wider intervals with the Poisson model when compared with Binomial probability variance estimate.	4
Mutants of the tumour suppressor p53 L1 loop as second-site suppressors for restoring DNA binding to oncogenic p53 mutations: structural and biochemical insights. || Cell Cycle Proteins DNA Humans Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Oncogene Proteins Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Stability Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || To assess the potential of mutations from the L1 loop of the tumour suppressor p53 as second-site suppressors, the effect of H115N and S116M on the p53 'hot spot' mutations has been investigated using the double-mutant approach. The effects of these two mutants on the p53 hot spots in terms of thermal stability and DNA binding were evaluated. The results show that: (i) the p53 mutants H115N and S116M are thermally more stable than wild-type p53; (ii) H115N but not S116M is capable of rescuing the DNA binding of one of the most frequent p53 mutants in cancer, R248Q, as shown by binding of R248Q/H115N to gadd45 (the promoter of a gene involved in cell-cycle arrest); (iii) the double mutant R248Q/H115N is more stable than wild-type p53; (iv) the effect of H115N as a second-site suppressor to restore DNA-binding activity is specific to R248Q, but not to R248W; (v) molecular-dynamics simulations indicate that R248Q/H115N has a conformation similar to wild-type p53, which is distinct from that of R248Q. These findings could be exploited in designing strategies for cancer therapy to identify molecules that could mimic the effect of H115N in restoring function to oncogenic p53 mutants.	0
Neonatal diabetes caused by activating mutations in the sulphonylurea receptor. ||  || Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in pancreatic β-cells play a crucial role in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. These channels are composed of two subunits: a pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2) and a regulatory subunit (sulphonylurea receptor-1). Recent studies identified large number of gain of function mutations in the regulatory subunit of the channel which cause neonatal diabetes. Majority of mutations cause neonatal diabetes alone, however some lead to a severe form of neonatal diabetes with associated neurological complications. This review focuses on the functional effects of these mutations as well as the implications for treatment.	4

A Designed Inhibitor of p53 Aggregation Rescues p53 Tumor Suppression in Ovarian Carcinomas. || Animals Cell Line Cell Proliferation Cells, Cultured Disease Models, Animal Female Humans Mice, Transgenic Ovarian Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Half of all human cancers lose p53 function by missense mutations, with an unknown fraction of these containing p53 in a self-aggregated amyloid-like state. Here we show that a cell-penetrating peptide, ReACp53, designed to inhibit p53 amyloid formation, rescues p53 function in cancer cell lines and in organoids derived from high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC), an aggressive cancer characterized by ubiquitous p53 mutations. Rescued p53 behaves similarly to its wild-type counterpart in regulating target genes, reducing cell proliferation and increasing cell death. Intraperitoneal administration decreases tumor proliferation and shrinks xenografts in vivo. Our data show the effectiveness of targeting a specific aggregation defect of p53 and its potential applicability to HGSOCs.	0
Inherited breast cancer predisposition in Asians: multigene panel testing outcomes from Singapore. ||  || Genetic testing for germline mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes can potentially identify individuals at a high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. There is a paucity of such mutational information for Asians. Panel testing of 25 cancer susceptibility genes and BRCA1/2 deletion/duplication analysis was performed for 220 Asian breast cancer patients or their family members referred for genetics risk assessment. All 220 participants had at least one high-risk feature: having a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in first- and/or second-degree relatives; having breast and ovarian cancer in the same individual or bilateral breast cancer; having early-onset breast cancer or ovarian cancer (⩽40 years of age). We identified 67 pathogenic variants in 66 (30.0%) patients. Of these, 19 (28.3%) occurred inBRCA1, 16 (23.9%) inBRCA2, 7 (10.4%) inPALB2, 6 (9.0%) inTP53, 2 (3.0%) inPTEN, 2 (3.0%) inCDH1 and 15 (22.4%) in other predisposition genes. Notably, 47.8% of pathogenic variants were in non-BRCA1/2 genes. Of the 66 patients with pathogenic mutations, 63.6% (42/66) were under the age of 40 years. Family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer is enriched in patients withBRCA1/2 pathogenic variants but less predictive for non-BRCA1/2 related pathogenic variations. We detected a median of three variants of unknown significance (VUS) per gene (range 0-21). Custom gene panel testing is feasible and useful for the detection of pathogenic mutations and should be done in the setting of a formal clinical cancer genetics service given the rate of VUS.	4
Genetic evaluation of American minority pediatric cochlear implant recipients. || Adolescent African Americans Caribbean Region Child Child, Preschool Cochlear Implantation Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Hispanic Americans Humans Infant Male Mutation Retrospective Studies Young Adult || To review the results of genetic evaluation of American minority pediatric cochlear implant recipients over a 5-year period. Case series review of pediatric cochlear implant recipients of Caribbean Hispanic and African American admixture descent with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss at a tertiary care children's hospital. Out of 28 patients receiving cochlear implants, 14 were of Caribbean Hispanic or African American admixture ancestry. Six (43%) had environmental risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss. Eight (57%) patients had presumed genetic sensorineural hearing loss; two of whom were syndromic and six non-syndromic. Patients with no clear etiology for hearing loss were tested for Gap Junction Beta 2 (GJB2) mutations. Within this admixture group, we found no biallelic mutations in GJB2, while two patients, both with environmental risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss, had monoallelic GJB2 variants. One patient of mixed ethnicity (Caribbean Hispanic, Turkish, Macedonian), not included as part of the 14, had the common Caucasian founder mutation, 35delG, along with a heterozygous polymorphism in the GJB2 gene. This extends previous data showing a paucity of GJB2 mutations in these admixture populations. We found no biallelic GJB2 mutations in our admixture cochlear implant population, and two sequence variants of the gene, only one of which was disease causing. This suggests that the incidence of GJB2 mutations in these admixture populations is low. Hence, there may be low cost-benefit of GJB2 mutation analysis in these admixture populations with severe to profound non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss.	4
[Analysis of deafness gene mutations by gene chip and its clinical significance]. ||  || To analyze deafness gene mutations by genechip. The peripheral blood samples were obtained and DNA templates were extracted by extraction kits. The deafness gene mutations were distinguished by genechip. Among 42 patients with non-syndromic hearing loss, GJB2 235delC was found in 11 cases (7 cases were homozygosis, 4 cases were heterozygosis); 4 cases were shown to carry the PDS IVS7-2A>G mutation. The incidence of GJB2 gene and PDS IVS7-2A>G mutations among the deaf- mute children in Guiyang city is 38.10%. Molecular genetic screening for these mutations and genetic counseling are effective methods to prevent the occurrence of hereditary hearing loss.	4
The genetic landscape and clinical implications of vertebral anomalies in VACTERL association. || Anal Canal Animals Esophagus Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Kidney Limb Deformities, Congenital Nervous System Malformations Phenotype Spine Trachea || VACTERL association is a condition comprising multisystem congenital malformations, causing severe physical disability in affected individuals. It is typically defined by the concurrence of at least three of the following component features: vertebral anomalies (V), anal atresia (A), cardiac malformations (C), tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TE), renal dysplasia (R) and limb abnormalities (L). Vertebral anomaly is one of the most important and common defects that has been reported in approximately 60-95% of all VACTERL patients. Recent breakthroughs have suggested that genetic factors play an important role in VACTERL association, especially in those with vertebral phenotypes. In this review, we summarised the genetic studies of the VACTERL association, especially focusing on the genetic aetiology of patients with vertebral anomalies. Furthermore, genetic reports of other syndromes with vertebral phenotypes overlapping with VACTERL association are also included. We aim to provide a further understanding of the genetic aetiology and a better evidence for genetic diagnosis of the association and vertebral anomalies.	4
Aggregation-primed molten globule conformers of the p53 core domain provide potential tools for studying p53C aggregation in cancer. || Humans Models, Molecular Neoplasms Protein Aggregates Protein Aggregation, Pathological Protein Conformation Protein Denaturation Protein Domains Protein Folding Protein Stability Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The functionality of the tumor suppressor p53 is altered in more than 50% of human cancers, and many individuals with cancer exhibit amyloid-like buildups of aggregated p53. An understanding of what triggers the pathogenic amyloid conversion of p53 is required for the further development of cancer therapies. Here, perturbation of the p53 core domain (p53C) with subdenaturing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride and high hydrostatic pressure revealed native-like molten globule (MG) states, a subset of which were highly prone to amyloidogenic aggregation. We found that MG conformers of p53C, probably representing population-weighted averages of multiple states, have different volumetric properties, as determined by pressure perturbation and size-exclusion chromatography. We also found that they bind the fluorescent dye 4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS) and have a native-like tertiary structure that occludes the single Trp residue in p53. Fluorescence experiments revealed conformational changes of the single Trp and Tyr residues before p53 unfolding and the presence of MG conformers, some of which were highly prone to aggregation. p53C exhibited marginal unfolding cooperativity, which could be modulated from unfolding to aggregation pathways with chemical or physical forces. We conclude that trapping amyloid precursor states in solution is a promising approach for understanding p53 aggregation in cancer. Our findings support the use of single-Trp fluorescence as a probe for evaluating p53 stability, effects of mutations, and the efficacy of therapeutics designed to stabilize p53.	0
Identification of potentially oncogenic alterations from tumor-only samples reveals Fanconi anemia pathway mutations in bladder carcinomas. ||  || Cancer is caused by germline and somatic mutations, which can share biological features such as amino acid change. However, integrated germline and somatic analysis remains uncommon. We present a framework that uses machine learning to learn features of recurrent somatic mutations to (1) predict somatic variants from tumor-only samples and (2) identify somatic-like germline variants for integrated analysis of tumor-normal DNA. Using data from 1769 patients from seven cancer types (bladder, glioblastoma, low-grade glioma, lung, melanoma, stomach, and pediatric glioma), we show that "somatic-like" germline variants are enriched for autosomal-dominant cancer-predisposition genes (p < 4.35 × 10-15), includingTP53. Our framework identifies germline and somatic nonsense variants inBRCA2 and other Fanconi anemia genes in 11% (11/100) of bladder cancer cases, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition in these patients. The bladder carcinoma patients with Fanconi anemia nonsense variants display aBRCA-deficiency somatic mutation signature, suggesting treatment targeted to DNA repair.	4
Diagnostic Clues for the Diagnosis of Nonsarcomeric Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (Phenocopies): Amyloidosis, Fabry Disease, and Mitochondrial Disease. || Amyloidosis Fabry disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common known inherited heart disorder, with a prevalence of 1:500 of the adult population. Etiology of HCM can be heterogeneous, with sarcomeric gene disease as the leading cause in up to 60% of the patients, and with a number of possible different diseases (phenocopies) in about 10%-15% of the patients. Early diagnosis of storage and infiltrative disorders, particularly those with specific treatments (i.e., Fabry disease and/or amyloidosis), means early management and treatment, with a significant impact on patients prognosis. Here, we report on four different cases of HCM, highlighting difficulties to make differential diagnosis of different forms of cardiomyopathies, and their potential impact on the management.	4
The genetic landscape of cardiomyopathy and its role in heart failure. || Animals Cardiomyopathies Heart Failure Humans || Heart failure is highly influenced by heritability, and nearly 100 genes link to familial cardiomyopathy. Despite the marked genetic diversity that underlies these complex cardiovascular phenotypes, several key genes and pathways have emerged. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by increased contractility and a greater energetic cost of cardiac output. Dilated cardiomyopathy is often triggered by mutations that disrupt the giant protein titin. The energetic consequences of these mutations offer molecular targets and opportunities for new drug development and gene correction therapies.	4
The p53 core domain is a molten globule at low pH: functional implications of a partially unfolded structure. || Acids Breast Neoplasms Cell Compartmentation Cell Line, Tumor Female Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular Protein Folding Protein Structure, Secondary Protein Structure, Tertiary Solvents Transfection Tryptophan Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a transcription factor that maintains genome integrity, and its function is lost in 50% of human cancers. The majority of p53 mutations are clustered within the core domain. Here, we investigate the effects of low pH on the structure of the wild-type (wt) p53 core domain (p53C) and the R248Q mutant. At low pH, the tryptophan residue is partially exposed to the solvent, suggesting a fluctuating tertiary structure. On the other hand, the secondary structure increases, as determined by circular dichroism. Binding of the probe bis-ANS (bis-8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate) indicates that there is an increase in the exposure of hydrophobic pockets for both wt and mutant p53C at low pH. This behavior is accompanied by a lack of cooperativity under urea denaturation and decreased stability under pressure when p53C is in acidic pH. Together, these results indicate that p53C acquires a partially unfolded conformation (molten-globule state) at low pH (5.0). The hydrodynamic properties of this conformation are intermediate between the native and denatured conformation. (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR spectroscopy confirms that the protein has a typical molten-globule structure at acidic pH when compared with pH 7.2. Human breast cells in culture (MCF-7) transfected with p53-GFP revealed localization of p53 in acidic vesicles, suggesting that the low pH conformation is present in the cell. Low pH stress also tends to favor high levels of p53 in the cells. Taken together, all of these data suggest that p53 may play physiological or pathological roles in acidic microenvironments.	0
Effects of common cancer mutations on stability and DNA binding of full-length p53 compared with isolated core domains. || Cell Cycle Proteins DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Mutation Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Protein Conformation Protein Denaturation Temperature Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Common cancer mutations of p53 tend either to lower the stability or distort the core domain of the protein or weaken its DNA binding affinity. We have previously analyzed in vitro the effects of mutations on the core domain of p53. Here, we extend those measurements to full-length p53, using either the wild-type protein or a biologically active superstable construct that is more amenable to accurate biophysical measurements to assess the possibilities of rescuing different types of mutations by anticancer drugs. The tetrameric full-length proteins had similar apparent melting temperatures to those of the individual domains, and the structural mutations lowered the melting temperature by similar amounts. The thermodynamic stability of tetrameric p53 is thus dictated by its core domain. We determined that the common contact mutation R273H weakened binding to the gadd45 recognition sequence by approximately 700-1000 times. Many mutants that have lowered melting temperatures should be good drug targets, although the common R273H mutant binds response elements too weakly for simple rescue.	0

We studied the PAH gene by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and/or sequencing techniques to identify pathogenic mutations in 71 PKU subjects. We classified the phenotype according to Guldberg predicted value. We identified 26 different mutations in 134 of the 142 alleles studied (94.4%), 88.7% of the subjects had biallelic pathogenic mutations while 11.3% had only one pathogenic mutation identified. Compound heterozygous represented 85.9% of the cases. Exon 7 included the majority of mutations (26.9%) and 50% of mutations were missense. The most frequent mutations were c.1066-11G > A, c.442-?_509+?del and p.Val388Met. The majority of subjects (52.3%) had the classic phenotype. The most frequent mutations in our Chilean PKU population were p.Val388Met, c.442?_509+?del and c.1066-11G > A. It is possible to predict phenotype by detecting the genotype, and use this information to determine disease prognosis and adjust patient's medical and nutritional management accordingly.	1 3
Modelling sarcomeric cardiomyopathies in the dish: from human heart samples to iPSC cardiomyocytes. || Animals Cardiomyopathies Cell Differentiation Cells, Cultured Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Models, Cardiovascular Mutation Myocytes, Cardiac Phenotype Sarcomeres Translational Medical Research || One of the obstacles to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of human cardiomyopathies has been poor availability of heart-tissue samples at early stages of disease development. This has possibly changed by the advent of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) from which cardiomyocytes can be derived in vitro. The main promise of hiPSC technology is that by capturing the effects of thousands of individual gene variants, the phenotype of differentiated derivatives of these cells will provide more information on a particular disease than simple genotyping. This article summarizes what is known about the 'human cardiomyopathy or heart failure phenotype in vitro', which constitutes the reference for modelling sarcomeric cardiomyopathies in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The current techniques for hiPSC generation and cardiac myocyte differentiation are briefly reviewed and the few published reports of hiPSC models of sarcomeric cardiomyopathies described. A discussion of promises and challenges of hiPSC-modelling of sarcomeric cardiomyopathies and individualized approaches is followed by a number of questions that, in the view of the authors, need to be answered before the true potential of this technology can be evaluated.	4
Identical mutations in three different fibroblast growth factor receptor genes in autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndromes. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Amino Acid Sequence Craniofacial Dysostosis Craniosynostoses DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genes, Dominant Humans Male Molecular Sequence Data Pedigree Point Mutation Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor Syndrome || Pfeiffer syndrome (PS; McKusick MIM 101,600) is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome with characteristic craniofacial anomalies and broad thumbs and big toes. We have previously demonstrated genetic heterogeneity in PS and mapped a gene to chromosome 8 (ref. 3) and a second to chromosome 10 (ref. 4). The gene on chromosome 8 is the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) with a common mutation (C755G) predicting a Pro252Arg substitution. The gene on chromosome 10 is FGFR2 with several different mutations causing sporadic and familial PS (Table 1). We report a recurrent single point mutation in the FGFR3 gene, located on chromosome 4p, in ten unrelated families with craniosynostosis syndromes. This mutation (C749G) predicts a Pro250Arg amino acid substitution in the extracellular domain of the FGFR3 protein. Interestingly, this common mutation occurs precisely at the analogous position within the FGFR3 protein as the mutations in FGFR1 (Pro252Arg) and FGFR2 (Pro253Arg) previously reported in Pfeiffer and Apert syndromes, respectively.	4
Carrier frequencies of hearing loss variants in newborns of China: A meta-analysis. ||  || The objective of this study was to review the carrier frequencies of hearing loss gene variants, such as GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1 in newborns of China. PubMed, Embase, BioCentral, CNKI, WanFang, and VIP databases were used for searching relevant literature studies published during the period of January 2007 and January 2016. Meta-analysis was performed by using the R software. The estimated rate and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the relevant indexes in newborns were collected and calculated using a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model when appropriate. In total, 35 of 958 published literature studies in Chinese and English were selected. The overall results showed that in newborns of China, the carrier frequencies of GJB2 variants (235 delC, 299 delAT) were 1.64% (95% CI 1.52% to 1.77%) and 0.33% (95% CI 0.19% to 0.51%); SLC26A4 variants (IVS7-2 A > G, 2168 A > G) were 1.02% (95% CI 0.91% to 1.15%) and 0.14% (95% CI 0.06% to 0.25%); MT-RNR1 variants (1555 A > G, 1449 C > T) were 0.20% (95% CI 0.17% to 0.23%) and 0.03% (95% CI 0.02% to 0.05%). There are high carrier frequencies of GJB2 variants among newborns in China, followed by SLC26A4 and MT-RNR1 variants. In order to achieve "early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment" and reduce the incidence of hereditary hearing loss in offspring, a comprehensive combination of neonatal hearing screening and deafness gene detection should be recommended and implemented in China.	4
Mutant p53 proteins bind DNA in a DNA structure-selective mode. || DNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Mutation Nucleic Acid Conformation Protein Array Analysis Protein Binding Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Despite the loss of sequence-specific DNA binding, mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins can induce or repress transcription of mutp53-specific target genes. To date, the molecular basis for transcriptional modulation by mutp53 is not understood, but increasing evidence points to the possibility that specific interactions of mutp53 with DNA play an important role. So far, the lack of a common denominator for mutp53 DNA binding, i.e. the existence of common sequence elements, has hampered further characterization of mutp53 DNA binding. Emanating from our previous discovery that DNA structure is an important determinant of wild-type p53 (wtp53) DNA binding, we analyzed the binding of various mutp53 proteins to oligonucleotides mimicking non-B DNA structures. Using various DNA-binding assays we show that mutp53 proteins bind selectively and with high affinity to non-B DNA. In contrast to sequence-specific and DNA structure-dependent binding of wtp53, mutp53 DNA binding to non-B DNA is solely dependent on the stereo-specific configuration of the DNA, and not on DNA sequence. We propose that DNA structure-selective binding of mutp53 proteins is the basis for the well-documented interaction of mutp53 with MAR elements and for transcriptional activities mediates by mutp53.	0
Hearing impairment in Dutch patients with connexin 26 (GJB2) and connexin 30 (GJB6) mutations. || Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Sequence Audiometry Child Child, Preschool Connexins Female Follow-Up Studies Genotype Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Netherlands Polymorphism, Genetic Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index || Despite the identification of mutations in the connexin 26 (GJB2) gene as the most common cause of recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, the pattern of hearing impairment with these mutations remains inconsistent. Recently a deletion encompassing the GJB6 gene was identified and hypothesized to also contribute to hearing loss. We hereby describe the hearing impairment in Dutch patients with biallelic connexin 26 (GJB2) and GJB2+connexin 30 (GJB6) mutations. The audiograms of patients who were screened for GJB2 and GJB6 mutations were analysed retrospectively. Standard statistical testing was done for symmetry and shape, while repeated measurement analysis was used to assess the relation between mutation and severity. Progression was also studied via linear regression analysis. Of 222 hearing-impaired individuals, 35 exhibited sequence variations; of these 19 had audiograms for study. Hearing loss in patients with biallelic "radical" (i.e. deletions, nonsense and splice site) mutations was significantly worse than in the wild type and heterozygotes (SAS proc GENMOD, p=0.013). The presence of at least one missense mutation in compound heterozygotes tends to lead to better hearing thresholds compared to biallelic radical mutations (p=0.08). One patient with the [35delG]+[del(GJB6-D13S1830)] genotype was severely impaired. Non-progressive hearing impairment was demonstrated in five 35delG homozygotes in individual longitudinal analyses. However a patient with the [299A>C]+[416G>A] genotype showed significant threshold progression in the lower frequencies. Findings on asymmetry and shape were inconclusive. Our data support the hypothesis that severity is a function of genotype and its effect on the amino acid sequence. A bigger cohort is required to establish non-progressivity more definitively.	4
Targeting Oncogenic Mutant p53 for Cancer Therapy. ||  || Among genetic alterations in human cancers, mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 gene are the most common, occurring in over 50% of human cancers. The majority of p53 mutations are missense mutations and result in the accumulation of dysfunctional p53 protein in tumors. These mutants frequently have oncogenic gain-of-function activities and exacerbate malignant properties of cancer cells, such as metastasis and drug resistance. Increasing evidence reveals that stabilization of mutant p53 in tumors is crucial for its oncogenic activities, while depletion of mutant p53 attenuates malignant properties of cancer cells. Thus, mutant p53 is an attractive druggable target for cancer therapy. Different approaches have been taken to develop small-molecule compounds that specifically target mutant p53. These include compounds that restore wild-type conformation and transcriptional activity of mutant p53, induce depletion of mutant p53, inhibit downstream pathways of oncogenic mutant p53, and induce synthetic lethality to mutant p53. In this review article, we comprehensively discuss the current strategies targeting oncogenic mutant p53 in cancers, with special focus on compounds that restore wild-type p53 transcriptional activity of mutant p53 and those reducing mutant p53 levels.	0
Gemcitabine treatment induces endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress and subsequently upregulates urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) to block mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in Panc-1 cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). || Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Deoxycytidine Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Heat-Shock Proteins Humans Mitochondria Neoplastic Stem Cells Pancreas Pancreatic Neoplasms Pyrimidines Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator || Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor survival rates. The presence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is believed to be among the underlying reasons for the aggressiveness of PDAC, which contributes to chemoresistance and recurrence. However, the mechanisms that induce chemoresistance and inhibit apoptosis remain largely unknown. We used serum-free medium to enrich CSCs from panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells and performed sphere formation testing, flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and semi-quantitative western blotting to confirm the stemness of panc-1 CSCs. Hallmarks of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including IRE1, PERK, ATF4, ATF6α, GRP78 and uPA expression, were detected after gemcitabine treatment. Effects of gemcitabine-induced uPA expression on cell invasion, sphere formation, colony formation and gemcitabine sensitivity were detected. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to detect interaction between the uPA mRNA 3'-UTR and mutant p53-R273H expressed by panc-1 CSCs. The effects of upregulated uPA by gemcitabine on apoptosis were detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and the impact of uPA on small molecule CP-31398-restored mutant p53 transcriptional activity was measured by a luciferase reporter assay. Enriched panc-1 CSCs expressing high levels of CD44 and CD133 also produced significantly higher amounts of Oct4 and Nanog. Compared with panc-1 cells, panc-1 CSCs presented chemoresistance to gemcitabine. ER stress gene detections demonstrated effects of gemcitabine-induced ER stress on both the pro-apoptotic and pro-survival branches. ER stress-induced ATF6α upregulated level of uPA by transcriptionally activating GRP78. Gemcitabine-induced uPA promoted invasion, sphere formation and colony formation and attenuated apoptosis induced by gemcitabine in panc-1 CSCs, depending on interaction with mutant p53-R273H. Upregulation of uPA abolished CP-31398-mediated restoration of mutant p53 transcriptional activity in panc-1 CSCs. Gemcitabine treatment induced ER stress and promoted mutant p53-R273H stabilization via transcriptionally activated uPA which may contribute to chemoresistance to gemcitabine. Notably, upregulation of uPA by gemcitabine treatment may lead to the failure of CP-31398; thus, a novel strategy for modulating mutant p53 function needs to be developed.	0
Spectrum and Frequency of the GJB2 Gene Pathogenic Variants in a Large Cohort of Patients with Hearing Impairment Living in a Subarctic Region of Russia (the Sakha Republic). || Adolescent Adult Arctic Regions Connexins Exons Female Gene Frequency Hearing Loss Humans Male Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Russia Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene, encoding connexin 26, are known to be a major cause of hearing impairment (HI). More than 300 allelic variants have been identified in the GJB2 gene. Spectrum and allelic frequencies of the GJB2 gene vary significantly among different ethnic groups worldwide. Until now, the spectrum and frequency of the pathogenic variants in exon 1, exon 2 and the flanking intronic regions of the GJB2 gene have not been described thoroughly in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), which is located in a subarctic region in Russia. The complete sequencing of the non-coding and coding regions of the GJB2 gene was performed in 393 patients with HI (Yakuts-296, Russians-51, mixed and other ethnicities-46) and in 187 normal hearing individuals of Yakut (n = 107) and Russian (n = 80) populations. In the total sample (n = 580), we revealed 12 allelic variants of the GJB2 gene, 8 of which were recessive pathogenic variants. Ten genotypes with biallelic recessive pathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene (in a homozygous or a compound heterozygous state) were found in 192 out of 393 patients (48.85%). We found that the most frequent GJB2 pathogenic variant in the Yakut patients was c.-23+1G>A (51.82%) and that the second most frequent was c.109G>A (2.37%), followed by c.35delG (1.64%). Pathogenic variants с.35delG (22.34%), c.-23+1G>A (5.31%), and c.313_326del14 (2.12%) were found to be the most frequent among the Russian patients. The carrier frequencies of the c.-23+1G>A and с.109G>A pathogenic variants in the Yakut control group were 10.20% and 2.80%, respectively. The carrier frequencies of с.35delG and c.101T>C were identical (2.5%) in the Russian control group. We found that the contribution of the GJB2 gene pathogenic variants in HI in the population of the Sakha Republic (48.85%) was the highest among all of the previously studied regions of Asia. We suggest that extensive accumulation of the c.-23+1G>A pathogenic variant in the indigenous Yakut population (92.20% of all mutant chromosomes in patients) and an extremely high (10.20%) carrier frequency in the control group may indicate a possible selective advantage for the c.-23+1G>A carriers living in subarctic climate.	4
HER3 and downstream pathways are involved in colonization of brain metastases from breast cancer. || Blotting, Western Brain Neoplasms Breast Neoplasms Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases ErbB Receptors Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Immunohistochemistry Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Receptor, ErbB-3 Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Metastases to the brain from breast cancer have a high mortality, and basal-like breast cancers have a propensity for brain metastases. However, the mechanisms that allow cells to colonize the brain are unclear. We used morphology, immunohistochemistry, gene expression and somatic mutation profiling to analyze 39 matched pairs of primary breast cancers and brain metastases, 22 unmatched brain metastases of breast cancer, 11 non-breast brain metastases and 6 autopsy cases of patients with breast cancer metastases to multiple sites, including the brain. Most brain metastases were triple negative and basal-like. The brain metastases over-expressed one or more members of the HER family and in particular HER3 was significantly over-expressed relative to matched primary tumors. Brain metastases from breast and other primary sites, and metastases to multiple organs in the autopsied cases, also contained somatic mutations in EGFR, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS or PIK3CA. This paralleled the frequent activation of AKT and MAPK pathways. In particular, activation of the MAPK pathway was increased in the brain metastases compared to the primary tumors. Deregulated HER family receptors, particularly HER3, and their downstream pathways are implicated in colonization of brain metastasis. The need for HER family receptors to dimerize for activation suggests that tumors may be susceptible to combinations of anti-HER family inhibitors, and may even be effective in the absence of HER2 amplification (that is, in triple negative/basal cancers). However, the presence of activating mutations in PIK3CA, HRAS, KRAS and NRAS suggests the necessity for also specifically targeting downstream molecules.	4
Prevalence of Fabry's disease within hemodialysis patients in Spain. ||  || To identify patients with Fabry's disease (FD) within patients with kidney dysfunction, submitted to hemodialysis. Patients under hemodialysis were screened using a combined enzymatic α-Gal A assay and dried blood spot samples to determine GLA genotype. A total of 3,650 samples (18.5% of all patients under hemodialysis in Spain) were tested and 11 new unrelated FD patients (4 males and 7 females) were diagnosed. 66 relatives of 11 patients were tested and 23 new FD patients were identified. This study allowed the diagnosis of 34 FD patients. Among the 11 unrelated FD patients, 5 presented the same R118C mutation and one novel mutation was detected: D109G. This study reveals the need for screening for FD in all patients under hemodialysis for unknown causes and indicates that the incidence and prevalence of FD are underestimated so far.	4
Is hearing loss due to mutations in the Connexin 26 gene progressive? || Adult Audiometry, Pure-Tone Auditory Threshold Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Disease Progression Female Follow-Up Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Homozygote Humans Infant Male Mutation Phenotype Risk Factors Time Factors || Serial audiograms were analysed for seven subjects, who were homozygous for the 35delG GJB2 mutation. The criterion for determining progression of hearing loss was at least a 1-dB loss in air conduction pure-tone average-3 (ACPTA-3) or ACPTA-4 per year for 2 to 10 years, with a minimum change of 10 dB ACPTA 3 or 4. Bilateral progression of hearing loss was found in 43% (3/7) of the subjects. A meta-analysis of seven studies with non-overlapping data sets and similar ascertainment criteria indicated that 19% of DFNB1 subjects with GJB2 mutations have progressive hearing loss. These data suggest that it may be incorrect to assume that congenital hearing loss due to this mutation is stable. We recommend rigorous audiologic surveillance for individuals with DFNB1.	4
Absence of BRAFV600E mutation in odontogenic keratocysts. || Adolescent Adult Aged Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome Brazil Carcinoma Child DNA Female Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Odontogenic Cysts Odontogenic Tumors Patched-1 Receptor Receptors, Cell Surface Young Adult || Mutations in the patched 1 (PTCH1) gene are the main genetic alteration reported in sporadic and nevoid basal cell carcinoma-associated odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). Oncogenic mutations, including BRAFV600E, previously considered exclusive of malignant neoplasms have been reported in odontogenic tumors. Recently, a high frequency of BRAFV600E mutation has been reported in OKC. Because of the considerable recurrence rate of OKC, the identification of druggable genetic mutations can be relevant in the management of extensive lesions. A set of 28 OKCs was included in this work. Initially, 10 sporadic and eight OKC samples from four NBCCS patients (a pair of lesions from each syndromic patient) were submitted to targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 2800 different mutations in 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, including BRAF. Ten extra sporadic OKC samples were included to assess BRAFV600E mutation using TaqMan allele-specific qPCR. The following missense mutations occurred in one case each: ATM p.Ser333Phe, SMO p.Gly416Glu, PIK3CA p.Ser326Phe, FBXW7 p.Ser438Phe, JAK2 p.Ser605Phe, PTEN p.Arg173His, ATM p.Cys353Arg, PTEN p.Ser294Arg, MET p.His1112Tyr. None of the 18 samples showed the BRAFV600E (or any other V600) mutation in the NGS. BRAFV600E mutation was detected by qPCR in one of the 10 OKC. Collectively, our results show BRAFV600E mutation in 1 of 28 OKC cases. On the basis of our results, OKCs do not present recurrent hotspot mutations in these 50 genes commonly mutated in cancer. In addition, BRAFV600E does not play a central role in OKC pathogenesis.	4

The Arg59Trp variant in ANGPTL8 (betatrophin) is associated with total and HDL-cholesterol in American Indians and Mexican Americans and differentially affects cleavage of ANGPTL3. || Adult Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Angiopoietin-like Proteins Arginine Blood Glucose Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19 Cohort Studies Coronary Disease Diabetes Mellitus Female Genome-Wide Association Study Hep G2 Cells Humans Indians, North American Insulin Male Mexican Americans Middle Aged Peptide Hormones Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Tryptophan || We previously identified a locus linked to total cholesterol (TC) concentration in Pima Indians on chromosome 19p. To characterize this locus, we genotyped >2000 SNPs in 1838 Pimas and assessed association with log(TC). We observed evidence for association with log(TC) with rs2278426 (3.5% decrease/copy of the T allele; P=5.045×10(-6)) in the ANGPTL8 (angiopoietin-like 8) gene. We replicated this association in 2413 participants of the San Antonio Mexican American Family Study (SAMAFS: 2.0% decrease per copy of the T allele; P=0.005842). In a meta-analysis of the combined data, we found the strongest estimated effect with rs2278426 (P=2.563×10(-7)). The variant T allele at rs2278426 predicts an Arg59Trp substitution and has previously been associated with LDL-C and HDL-C. In Pimas and SAMAFS participants, the T allele of rs2278426 was associated with reduced HDL-C levels (P=0.000741 and 0.00002, respectively), and the combined estimated effect for the two cohorts was -3.8% (P=8.526×10(-8)). ANGPTL8 transcript and protein levels increased in response to both glucose and insulin. The variant allele was associated with increased levels of cleaved ANGPTL3. We conclude that individuals with the variant allele may have lower TC and HDL-C levels due to increased activation of ANGPTL3 by ANGPTL8.	4
Impaired surface expression and conductance of the KCNQ4 channel lead to sensorineural hearing loss. || Cell Membrane Electrophysiology Gene Expression Regulation Genes, Dominant HEK293 Cells HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins Hair Cells, Auditory Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans KCNQ Potassium Channels Membrane Potentials Microscopy, Fluorescence Molecular Chaperones Mutation Surface Properties || KCNQ4, a voltage-gated potassium channel, plays an important role in maintaining cochlear ion homoeostasis and regulating hair cell membrane potential, both essential for normal auditory function. Mutations in the KCNQ4 gene lead to DFNA2, a subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic deafness that is characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss across all frequencies. Despite recent advances in the identification of pathogenic KCNQ4 mutations, the molecular aetiology of DFNA2 remains unknown. We report here that decreased cell surface expression and impaired conductance of the KCNQ4 channel are two mechanisms underlying hearing loss in DFNA2. In HEK293T cells, a dramatic decrease in cell surface expression was detected by immunofluorescent microscopy and confirmed by Western blot for the pathogenic KCNQ4 mutants L274H, W276S, L281S, G285C, G285S, G296S and G321S, while their overall cellular levels remained normal. In addition, none of these mutations affected tetrameric assembly of KCNQ4 channels. Consistent with these results, all mutants showed strong dominant-negative effects on the wild-type (WT) channel function. Most importantly, overexpression of HSP90β, a key component of the molecular chaperone network that controls the KCNQ4 biogenesis, significantly increased cell surface expression of the KCNQ4 mutants L281S, G296S and G321S. KCNQ4 surface expression was restored or considerably improved in HEK293T cells mimicking the heterozygous condition of these mutations in DFNA2 patients. Finally, our electrophysiological studies demonstrated that these mutations directly compromise the conductance of the KCNQ4 channel, since no significant change in KCNQ4 current was observed after KCNQ4 surface expression was restored or improved.	0
Re-engineered p53 activates apoptosis in vivo and causes primary tumor regression in a dominant negative breast cancer xenograft model. || Animals Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Dependovirus Female Genetic Therapy Genetic Vectors HEK293 Cells Heterografts Humans Mice Mice, Nude Neoplasm Transplantation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Inactivation of p53 pathway is reported in more than half of all human tumors and can be correlated to malignant development. Missense mutation in the DNA binding region of p53 is the most common mechanism of p53 inactivation in cancer cells. The resulting tumor-derived p53 variants, similar to wild-type (wt) p53, retain their ability to oligomerize via the tetramerization domain. Upon hetero-oligomerization, mutant p53 enforces a dominant negative effect over active wt-p53 in cancer cells. To overcome this barrier, we have previously designed a chimeric superactive p53 (p53-CC) with an alternative oligomerization domain capable of escaping transdominant inhibition by mutant p53 in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate the superior tumor suppressor activity of p53-CC and its ability to cause tumor regression of the MDA-MB-468 aggressive p53-dominant negative breast cancer tumor model in vivo. In addition, we illustrate the profound effects of the dominant negative effect of endogenous mutant p53 over wt-p53 in cancer cells. Finally, we investigate the underlying differential mechanisms of activity for p53-CC and wt-p53 delivered using viral-mediated gene therapy approach in the MDA-MB-468 tumor model.	0
[Detection of the mutational gene in phenylketonuria and prenatal diagnoses by using single strand conformation polymorphism methods]. || Exons Female Fetal Diseases Humans Male Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis || To establish rapid methods for the detection of gene mutations and prenatal diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). The single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) combined with silver staining technique were used to screen the mutations in the four exons of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. After the polymerase chain reaction, the DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel containing glycerol and visualized by silver staining. Three known missense mutations which are R243Q (E7)[CGA(Arg243)-->CAA (Gln)], R413P(E12) [CGC(Arg413)-->CCC(Pro)] and Y356X(E11)[TAC(Tyr156)-->TAA(Ter)] were detected in 21 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 7 degrees C. Three kinds of unknown abnormal DNA bands in exon 10 were detected in 21 degrees C. The mutations of 13 PKU families have been detected. Prenatal gene diagnoses were successfully performed in 5 pregnancies at risk with PKU. The method is very useful for detecting the mutations and prenatal diagnoses of PKU families.	3
A common SLC26A4-linked haplotype underlying non-syndromic hearing loss with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct. || Alleles Child Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7 Cohort Studies Female Genetic Variation Genotype Haplotypes Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Male Membrane Transport Proteins Microsatellite Repeats Sequence Analysis, DNA Sulfate Transporters Vestibular Aqueduct || Enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is the most common radiological abnormality in children with sensorineural hearing loss. Mutations in coding regions and splice sites of the SLC26A4 gene are often detected in Caucasians with EVA. Approximately one-fourth of patients with EVA have two mutant alleles (M2), one-fourth have one mutant allele (M1) and one-half have no mutant alleles (M0). The M2 genotype is correlated with a more severe phenotype. We performed genotype-haplotype analysis and massively parallel sequencing of the SLC26A4 region in patients with M1 EVA and their families. We identified a shared novel haplotype, termed CEVA (Caucasian EVA), composed of 12 uncommon variants upstream of SLC26A4. The presence of the CEVA haplotype on seven of ten 'mutation-negative' chromosomes in a National Institutes of Health M1 EVA discovery cohort and six of six mutation-negative chromosomes in a Danish M1 EVA replication cohort is higher than the observed prevalence of 28 of 1006 Caucasian control chromosomes (p<0.0001 for each EVA cohort). The corresponding heterozygous carrier rate is 28/503 (5.6%). The prevalence of CEVA (11 of 126) is also increased among M0 EVA chromosomes (p=0.0042). The CEVA haplotype causally contributes to most cases of Caucasian M1 EVA and, possibly, some cases of M0 EVA. The CEVA haplotype of SLC26A4 defines the most common allele associated with hereditary hearing loss in Caucasians. The diagnostic yield and prognostic utility of sequence analysis ofSLC26A4 exons and splice sites will be markedly increased by addition of testing for the CEVA haplotype.	1
[MODY 3 correlations between the genotype and clinical manifestations of diabetes]. ||  || We analyzed the mutations identified in a family affected by Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY3), and searched for correlations between the genotype and clinical manifestations of diabetes. In 4 of 9 subjects we have demonstrated a heterozygous missense mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alfa (HNF1α). The missense mutation, caused by a G>A transition at nucleotide 815 of exon 4 (c.815G>A), resulted in the substitution of arginine with histidine at codon 272 (p.Arg272His). This mutation occurs in the DNA binding domain of HNF1α. Heterogenity of clinical characteristic in patients was evident. Variability in age of onset, presence of obesity and evolution time was present. In conclusion, clinical presentation of diabetes is otherwise atipical for the assumed etiology. Thus, the diagnosis of MODY should be raised in various clinical circumstances. Molecular diagnosis has important consequences in terms of prognosis, family screening, and therapy.	4

Mutations in p53 have been observed in over 60% of all human cancers. Certain classes of mutant p53 proteins maintain some of their activities or acquire novel activities and thus may contribute to the transformed phenotype. By carrying out an analysis of differential gene expression using cDNA expression arrays, we compared the expression patterns of cells expressing no p53 to isogenic lines expressing the codon 248 Arg to Trp mutant p53 allele (R248W). In this report, we show that the R248W and D281G p53 mutants, two of the more commonly occurring mutations, as well as wild type p53, repress transcription of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases type 3 (TIMP-3) gene by greater than tenfold. TIMP-3 expression has been observed to be repressed in many tumors and its reduced expression is thought to contribute to tumor metastasis and invasiveness by allowing increased activity of metalloproteinases in the extracellular matrix. Since mutant forms of p53 tend to be expressed at greatly elevated levels in many human tumors, the retention of their ability to repress TIMP-3 illustrate one mechanism by which mutant forms of the p53 gene may contribute to tumorigenesis.	0
RADIA: RNA and DNA integrated analysis for somatic mutation detection. || Adenocarcinoma Endometrial Neoplasms Female Genome, Human Humans Lung Neoplasms Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA Sequence Analysis, RNA Software || The detection of somatic single nucleotide variants is a crucial component to the characterization of the cancer genome. Mutation calling algorithms thus far have focused on comparing the normal and tumor genomes from the same individual. In recent years, it has become routine for projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to also sequence the tumor RNA. Here we present RADIA (RNA and DNA Integrated Analysis), a novel computational method combining the patient-matched normal and tumor DNA with the tumor RNA to detect somatic mutations. The inclusion of the RNA increases the power to detect somatic mutations, especially at low DNA allelic frequencies. By integrating an individual's DNA and RNA, we are able to detect mutations that would otherwise be missed by traditional algorithms that examine only the DNA. We demonstrate high sensitivity (84%) and very high precision (98% and 99%) for RADIA in patient data from endometrial carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma from TCGA. Mutations with both high DNA and RNA read support have the highest validation rate of over 99%. We also introduce a simulation package that spikes in artificial mutations to patient data, rather than simulating sequencing data from a reference genome. We evaluate sensitivity on the simulation data and demonstrate our ability to rescue back mutations at low DNA allelic frequencies by including the RNA. Finally, we highlight mutations in important cancer genes that were rescued due to the incorporation of the RNA.	4
A Rapid, High-Quality, Cost-Effective, Comprehensive and Expandable Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Assay for Inherited Heart Diseases. || Base Sequence Cost-Benefit Analysis Gene Targeting Heart Diseases High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Molecular Sequence Data Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Time Factors || Thousands of mutations across >50 genes have been implicated in inherited cardiomyopathies. However, options for sequencing this rapidly evolving gene set are limited because many sequencing services and off-the-shelf kits suffer from slow turnaround, inefficient capture of genomic DNA, and high cost. Furthermore, customization of these assays to cover emerging targets that suit individual needs is often expensive and time consuming. We sought to develop a custom high throughput, clinical-grade next-generation sequencing assay for detecting cardiac disease gene mutations with improved accuracy, flexibility, turnaround, and cost. We used double-stranded probes (complementary long padlock probes), an inexpensive and customizable capture technology, to efficiently capture and amplify the entire coding region and flanking intronic and regulatory sequences of 88 genes and 40 microRNAs associated with inherited cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease, and cardiac development. Multiplexing 11 samples per sequencing run resulted in a mean base pair coverage of 420, of which 97% had >20× coverage and >99% were concordant with known heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms. The assay correctly detected germline variants in 24 individuals and revealed several polymorphic regions in miR-499. Total run time was 3 days at an approximate cost of $100 per sample. Accurate, high-throughput detection of mutations across numerous cardiac genes is achievable with complementary long padlock probe technology. Moreover, this format allows facile insertion of additional probes as more cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease genes are discovered, giving researchers a powerful new tool for DNA mutation detection and discovery.	4
Target sequencing of 307 deafness genes identifies candidate genes implicated in microtia. ||  || Microtia is a congenital malformation of the external ear caused by genetic and/or environmental factors. However, no causal genetic mutations have been identified in isolated microtia patients. In this study, we utilized targeted genomic capturing combined with next-generation sequencing to screen for mutations in 307 deafness genes in 32 microtia patients. Forty-two rare heterozygous mutations in 25 genes, including 22 novel mutations in 24 isolated unilateral microtia cases were identified. Pathway analysis found five pathways especially focal adhesion pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway were significantly associated with microtia. The low-frequency variants association study was used and highlighted several strong candidate genes MUC4, MUC6, COL4A4, MYO7A, AKAP12, COL11A1, DSPP, ESPN, GPR98, PCDH15, BSN, CACNA1D, TPRN, andUSH1C for microtia (P = 2.51 × 10-4). Among these genes,COL4A4 andCOL11A1 may lead to microtia through focal adhesion pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway which are connected to the downstreamWnt signaling pathway. The present results indicate that certain genes may affect both external/middle and inner ear development, and demonstrate the benefits of using a capture array in microtia patients.	4
Three assays show differences in binding of wild-type and mutant p53 to unique gene sequences. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus DNA Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Nuclear Proteins Protein Binding Sequence Analysis, DNA Streptavidin Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cancer-associated mutations in the p53 gene often change amino acids in the protein's DNA binding domain. We used three different binding assays specifically gel shift, DNA binding scintillation proximity assay and a streptavidin magnetic bead assay to analyze the DNA binding of the tumor suppressor p53 from 4 human cell lines with different DNA sequences from the mdm2, p21 and cyclin G genes and a mutant form of the cyclin G sequence. Treatment of MCF-7 cells having wild-type p53 with hydrogen peroxide increased the binding of p53 to DNA as detected using all three assays, but to different extents. The p53 proteins from the thyroid cancer cell lines with different p53 mutations (ARO, WRO and NPA) have comparable binding reactions in the three assays, but show different specificities for the sequences. Here we show that multiple different binding assays allow us to generate a more complete picture of the function of DNA transcription factors in diseases such as cancer.	0
TERT promoter mutations in ocular melanoma distinguish between conjunctival and uveal tumours. || Aged Cohort Studies Conjunctival Neoplasms Diagnosis, Differential Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Association Studies Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mutation Promoter Regions, Genetic Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Telomerase Uveal Neoplasms || Recently, activating mutations in the TERT promoter were identified in cutaneous melanoma. We tested a cohort of ocular melanoma samples for similar mutations. The TERT promoter region was analysed by Sanger sequencing in 47 uveal (ciliary body or choroidal) melanomas and 38 conjunctival melanomas. Mutations of the TERT promoter were not identified in uveal melanomas, but were detected in 12 (32%) conjunctival melanomas. Mutations had a UV signature and were identical to those found in cutaneous melanoma. Mutations of TERT promoter with UV signatures are frequent in conjunctival melanomas and favour a pathogenetic kinship with cutaneous melanomas. Absence of these mutations in uveal melanomas emphasises their genetic distinction from cutaneous and conjunctival melanomas.	4
Targeted next-generation sequencing helps to decipher the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Adult Aged Arrhythmias, Cardiac Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child Child, Preschool Exons High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Myofibrils Phenotype Syndrome Young Adult || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is mainly associated with myosin, heavy chain 7 (MYH7) and myosin binding protein C, cardiac (MYBPC3) mutations. In order to better explain the clinical and genetic heterogeneity in HCM patients, in this study, we implemented a target-next generation sequencing (NGS) assay. An Ion AmpliSeq™ Custom Panel for the enrichment of 19 genes, of which 9 of these did not encode thick/intermediate and thin myofilament (TTm) proteins and, among them, 3 responsible of HCM phenocopy, was created. Ninety-two DNA samples were analyzed by the Ion Personal Genome Machine: 73 DNA samples (training set), previously genotyped in some of the genes by Sanger sequencing, were used to optimize the NGS strategy, whereas 19 DNA samples (discovery set) allowed the evaluation of NGS performance. In the training set, we identified 72 out of 73 expected mutations and 15 additional mutations: the molecular diagnosis was achieved in one patient with a previously wild-type status and the pre-excitation syndrome was explained in another. In the discovery set, we identified 20 mutations, 5 of which were in genes encoding non-TTm proteins, increasing the diagnostic yield by approximately 20%: a single mutation in genes encoding non-TTm proteins was identified in 2 out of 3 borderline HCM patients, whereas co-occuring mutations in genes encoding TTm and galactosidase alpha (GLA) altered proteins were characterized in a male with HCM and multiorgan dysfunction. Our combined targeted NGS-Sanger sequencing-based strategy allowed the molecular diagnosis of HCM with greater efficiency than using the conventional (Sanger) sequencing alone. Mutant alleles encoding non-TTm proteins may aid in the complete understanding of the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of HCM: co-occuring mutations of genes encoding TTm and non-TTm proteins could explain the wide variability of the HCM phenotype, whereas mutations in genes encoding only the non-TTm proteins are identifiable in patients with a milder HCM status.	4
Seven novel mutations in the long isoform of the USH2A gene in Chinese families with nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome Type II. ||  || To describe the clinical and genetic findings in one Chinese family with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) and in three unrelated Chinese families with Usher syndrome type II (USH2). One family (FR1) with arRP and three unrelated families (F6, F7, and F8) with Usher syndrome (USH), including eight affected members and seven unaffected family individuals were examined clinically. The study included 100 normal Chinese individuals as normal controls. After obtaining informed consent, peripheral blood samples from all participants were collected and genomic DNA was extracted. Genotyping and haplotyping analyses were performed on the known genetic loci for arRP with a panel of polymorphic markers in family FR1. In all four families, the coding region (exons 2-72), including the intron-exon boundary of the USH2A (Usher syndrome type -2A protein) gene, was screened by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Whenever substitutions were identified in a patient, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, or high resolution melt curve analysis (HRM) was performed on all available family members and on the 100 normal controls. The affected individuals presented with typical fundus features of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), including narrowing of the vessels, bone-spicule pigmentation, and waxy optic discs. The electroretinogram (ERG) wave amplitudes of the available probands were undetectable. Audiometric tests in the affected individuals in family FR1 were normal, while indicating moderate to severe sensorineural hearing impairment in the affected individuals in families F6, F7, and F8. Vestibular function was normal in all patients from all four families. The disease-causing gene in family FR1 was mapped to the USH2A locus on chromosome 1q41. Seven novel mutations (two missenses, one 7-bp deletion, two small deletions, and two nonsenses) were detected in the four families after sequencing analysis of USH2A. The results further support that mutations of USH2A are also responsible for non-syndromic RP. The mutation spectrum among Chinese patients might differ from that among European Caucasians.	1
Wrapping effects within a proposed function-rescue strategy for the Y220C oncogenic mutation of protein p53. || Binding Sites Carbazoles Drug Design Humans Hydrogen Bonding Molecular Docking Simulation Mutation Protein Binding Protein Folding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Structure, Secondary Static Electricity Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Water || Soluble proteins must protect their structural integrity from water attack by wrapping interactions which imply the clustering of nonpolar residues around the backbone hydrogen bonds. Thus, poorly wrapped hydrogen bonds constitute defects which have been identified as promoters of protein associations since they favor the removal of hydrating molecules. More specifically, a recent study of our group has shown that wrapping interactions allow the successful identification of protein binding hot spots. Additionally, we have also shown that drugs disruptive of protein-protein interfaces tend to mimic the wrapping behavior of the protein they replace. Within this context, in this work we study wrapping three body interactions related to the oncogenic Y220C mutation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Our computational results rationalize the oncogenic nature of the Y220C mutation, explain the binding of a drug-like molecule already designed to restore the function of p53 and provide clues to help improve this function-rescue strategy and to apply in other drug design or re-engineering techniques.	0
Autophagy is required for cell survival under L-asparaginase-induced metabolic stress in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Asparaginase Autophagy Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Fluorescent Antibody Technique Humans Mice Mice, Inbred NOD Mice, SCID Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Stress, Physiological || L-asparaginase has been used for more than three decades in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and remains an essential drug in the treatment of ALL. Poor response to L-asparaginase is associated with increased risk of therapeutic failure in ALL. However, both the metabolic perturbation and molecular context of L-asparaginase-treated ALL cells has not been fully elucidated. Here we identify that treatment with L-asparaginase results in metabolic shutdown via the reduction of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by mitochondrial damage and activation of autophagy. The autophagy is involved in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by eliminating injured mitochondria. Inhibition of autophagy enhances L-asparaginase-induced cytotoxicity and overcomes the acquired resistance to L-asparaginase in ALL cells. The ROS-p53-positive feedback loop is an essential mechanism of this synergistic cytotoxicity. Thus, our findings provide the rationale for the future development of combined treatment of L-asparaginase and anti-autophagy drug in ALL patients.	0
The cytotoxic effects of regorafenib in combination with protein kinase D inhibition in human colorectal cancer cells. || Apoptosis Blotting, Western Cell Proliferation Colorectal Neoplasms Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Drug Synergism Humans Immunoenzyme Techniques Phenylurea Compounds Protein Kinase C Pyridines RNA, Small Interfering Signal Transduction Tumor Cells, Cultured || Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a major public health problem, and diagnosis of metastatic disease is usually associated with poor prognosis. The multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib was approved in 2013 in the U.S. for the treatment of mCRC patients who progressed after standard therapies. However, the clinical efficacy of regorafenib is quite limited. One potential strategy to improve mCRC therapy is to combine agents that target key cellular signaling pathways, which may lead to synergistic enhancement of antitumor efficacy and overcome cellular drug resistance. Protein kinase D (PKD), a family of serine/threonine kinases, mediates key signaling pathways implicated in multiple cellular processes. Herein, we evaluated the combination of regorafenib with a PKD inhibitor in several human CRC cells. Using the Chou-Talalay model, the combination index values for this combination treatment demonstrated synergistic effects on inhibition of cell proliferation and clonal formation. This drug combination resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by flow cytometry, increased PARP cleavage, and decreased activation of the anti-apoptotic protein HSP27. This combination also yielded enhanced inhibition of ERK, AKT, and NF-κB signaling. Taken together, PKD inhibition in combination with regorafenib appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of mCRC.	0
TP53 Mutations in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Their Impact on Disease Progression and Treatment Response. || Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Disease Progression Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans Mutation Prognosis Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Recent studies describing the mutational landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) on a genomic scale by our group and others, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, have provided unprecedented perspective for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of HNSCC progression and response to treatment. These studies confirmed that mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene were the most frequent of all somatic genomic alterations in HNSCC, alluding to the importance of the TP53 gene in suppressing the development and progression of this disease. Clinically, TP53 mutations are significantly associated with short survival time and tumor resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in HNSCC patients, which makes the TP53 mutation status a potentially useful molecular factor for risk stratification and predictor of clinical response in these patients. In addition to loss of wild-type p53 function and the dominant-negative effect on the remaining wild-type p53, some p53 mutants often gain oncogenic functions to promote tumorigenesis and progression. Different p53 mutants may possess different gain-of-function properties. Herein, we review the most up-to-date information about TP53 mutations available via The Cancer Genome Atlas-based analysis of HNSCC and discuss our current understanding of the potential tumor-suppressive role of p53, focusing on gain-of-function activities of p53 mutations. We also summarize our knowledge regarding the use of the TP53 mutation status as a potential evaluation or stratification biomarker for prognosis and a predictor of clinical response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in HNSCC patients. Finally, we discuss possible strategies for targeting HNSCCs bearing TP53 mutations. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 2682-2692, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	0
Connexin 26 mutation 35delG: prevalence of carriers in various regions in France. || Adult Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female France Gene Deletion Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genotype Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Prevalence || Mutation 35delG in the connexin 26 gene is the main cause of recessive deafness in Europe. The prevalence of carriers varies, with a mean value proportion of 1/30 in Mediterranean countries. The aim of this study is to determinate the percentage of carriers in several regions of the Mediterranean coast in France. This study has been carried out on the genomic DNAs out of a total of 1584 healthy subjects, originating from five French towns or regions, genotyped by Taqman assays. the approximate carrier proportions of the 35delG mutation are 1/50 in Perpignan, 1/65 in Montpellier, 1/66 in Toulon, 1/53 in Grasse. This carrier proportion is 1/31 for the region of Marseilles, a value near the maximal value already obtained in France for Corsica.	4
Long-term follow-up in patients with Pendred syndrome: vestibular, auditory and other phenotypes. || Adolescent Adult Auditory Threshold Chi-Square Distribution Child Child, Preschool Female Follow-Up Studies Goiter Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation, Missense Nystagmus, Pathologic Phenotype Retrospective Studies Sulfate Transporters Syndrome Vertigo Vestibular Aqueduct || Fourteen patients with a Pendred syndrome gene (Pds) mutation and three patients without the mutation were studied to evaluate long-term vestibular and auditory manifestations among patients with bilateral enlarged vestibular aqueducts (EVA). Charts were reviewed retrospectively for age, gender, otological history, presence or absence of vertigo, results of magnetic resonance imaging, relevant gene mutations and perchlorate discharge test. A missense mutation, His 723 Arg (H723R), was identified in the homozygous state in six patients and in the heterozygous state in seven patients. Another missense mutation, Tyr 410 Met (T410 M), was identified in the heterozygous state in one patient. Patients with vertigo tended to have hearing fluctuation, compared with the patients without vertigo. Patients homozygous for H723R tended to have more episodes of vertigo than the heterozygous individuals. Only one patient who was homozygous for H723R had goiter. The long-term outcome of hearing level in patients with the H723R mutation was significantly better compared with published results for patients with a Pds mutation, but not for those with the H723R mutation. Whether environmental factors or a subtype of the Pds mutation H723R are related to the long-term outcome for these patients must be clarified.	1
Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) induces cell migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition through WNK1/snail in non-small cell lung cancer. ||  || The extracellular matrix is a component of physiological microenvironment and a regulator of cellular processes such as migration and proliferation. Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC/osteonectin) is an extracellular matrix-associated glycoprotein involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell migration in several types of cancers. However, the role of SPARC in lung cancer is paradoxical and details of the regulatory mechanism are not well-known. In this study, we investigated novel SPARC-mediated signaling pathways. Treatment of SPARC increased cell proliferation, migration, and mesenchymal phenotype in two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, CL1-5 and H1299. We found that these phenotypes were not regulated by focal adhesion kinase and Src kinase, but were mediated by with no lysine (K) kinase 1 (WNK1). Suppression of WNK1 expression decreased the expression of SPARC-induced N-cadherin and smooth muscle actin. Moreover, Snail, an important transcription factor for regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is also involved in SPARC/WNK1 pathway. In a murine tumor model, SPARC treatment significantly induced phosphorylation of Akt and WNK1 in lung tumor nodules when compared to control mice. In conclusion, these data suggest that WNK1 is a novel molecule in SPARC-mediated mesenchymal signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.	0
Differential mechanisms of asparaginase resistance in B-type acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant natural killer cell lines. || Apoptosis Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Asparaginase Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase Cell Line, Tumor Humans Killer Cells, Natural Lymphoma Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Multiprotein Complexes Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Signal Transduction TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases eIF-2 Kinase || Bacterial L-asparaginase (ASNase), hydrolyzing L-asparagine (Asn), is an important drug for treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma. Although different native or pegylated ASNase-based chemotherapy are efficient, disease relapse is frequently observed, especially in adult patients. The neo-synthesis of Asn by asparagine synthetase (AsnS) following ASNase treatment, which involves the amino acid response and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, is believed to be the basis of ASNase-resistance mechanisms. However, AsnS expression has not emerged as an accurate predictive factor for ASNase susceptibility. The aim of this study was to identify possible ASNase sensitivity/resistance-related genes or pathways using a new asparaginase, namely a pegylated r-crisantaspase, with a focus on classic Asn-compensatory responses and cell death under conditions of Asn/L-glutamine limitation. We show that, for B-ALL cell lines, changes in the expression of apoptosis-regulatory genes (especially NFκB-related genes) are associated with ASNase susceptibility. The response of malignant NK cell lines to ASNase may depend on Asn-compensatory mechanisms and other cellular processes such as cleavage of BCL2A1, a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 protein family. These results suggest that according to cellular context, factors other than AsnS can influence ASNase susceptibility.	0
Resistance and gain-of-resistance phenotypes in cancers harboring wild-type p53. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Neoplasms Phosphorylation Protein Processing, Post-Translational Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Chemotherapy is the bedrock for the clinical management of cancer, and the tumor suppressor p53 has a central role in this therapeutic modality. This protein facilitates favorable antitumor drug response through a variety of key cellular functions, including cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. These functions essentially cease once p53 becomes mutated, as occurs in ∼50% of cancers, and some p53 mutants even exhibit gain-of-function effects, which lead to greater drug resistance. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that resistance is also seen in cancers harboring wild-type p53. In this review, we discuss how wild-type p53 is inactivated to render cells resistant to antitumor drugs. This may occur through various mechanisms, including an increase in proteasomal degradation, defects in post-translational modification, and downstream defects in p53 target genes. We also consider evidence that the resistance seen in wild-type p53 cancers can be substantially greater than that seen in mutant p53 cancers, and this poses a far greater challenge for efforts to design strategies that increase drug response in resistant cancers already primed with wild-type p53. Because the mechanisms contributing to this wild-type p53 "gain-of-resistance" phenotype are largely unknown, a concerted research effort is needed to identify the underlying basis for the occurrence of this phenotype and, in parallel, to explore the possibility that the phenotype may be a product of wild-type p53 gain-of-function effects. Such studies are essential to lay the foundation for a rational therapeutic approach in the treatment of resistant wild-type p53 cancers.	0
Mechanistic differences in the transcriptional activation of p53 by 14-3-3 isoforms. || 14-3-3 Proteins Binding Sites Cell Line DNA Humans Protein Isoforms Protein Structure, Tertiary Thermodynamics Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 maintains genome integrity by initiating the transcription of genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis and DNA repair. The activity of p53 is regulated by both post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. p53 that has been phosphorylated at S366, S378 and T387 binds 14-3-3 proteins in vitro. Here, we show that these sites are potential 14-3-3 binding sites in vivo. Epsilon (epsilon) and gamma (gamma) isoforms required phosphorylation at either of these sites for efficient interaction with p53, while for sigma (sigma) and tau (tau) these sites are dispensable. Further, sigma and tau bound more weakly to p53 C-terminal phosphopeptides than did epsilon and gamma. However, the four isoforms bound tightly to di-phosphorylated p53 C-terminal peptides than did the mono-phosphorylated counterparts. Interestingly, all the isoforms studied transcriptionally activated wild-type p53. sigma and tau stabilized p53 levels in cells, while epsilon and gamma stimulated p53-DNA binding activity in vitro. Overall, the results suggest that structurally and functionally similar 14-3-3 isoforms may exert their regulatory potential on p53 through different mechanisms. We discuss the isoform-specific roles of 14-3-3 in p53 stabilization and activation of specific-DNA binding.	0
Regulation of ASPP2 interaction with p53 core domain by an intramolecular autoinhibitory mechanism. || Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Binding Sites Fluorescence Polarization Gene Expression Regulation Humans Microscopy, Fluorescence Models, Molecular NF-kappa B Peptides Proline Protein Structure, Tertiary Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 src Homology Domains || ASPP2 is a key protein in regulating apoptosis both in p53-dependent and-independent pathways. The C-terminal part of ASPP2 contains four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain (Ank-SH3) that mediate the interactions of ASPP2 with apoptosis related proteins such as p53, Bcl-2 and the p65 subunit of NFκB. p53 core domain (p53CD) binds the n-src loop and the RT loop of ASPP2 SH3. ASPP2 contains a disordered proline rich domain (ASPP2 Pro) that forms an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction with the Ank-SH3 domains. Here we show how this intramolecular interaction affects the intermolecular interactions of ASPP2 with p53, Bcl-2 and NFkB. We used biophysical methods to obtain better understanding of the relationship between ASPP2 and its partners for getting a comprehensive view on ASPP2 pathways. Fluorescence anisotropy competition experiments revealed that both ASPP2 Pro and p53CD competed for binding the n-src loop of the ASPP2 SH3, indicating regulation of p53CD binding to this loop by ASPP2 Pro. Peptides derived from the ASPP2-binding interface of Bcl-2 did not compete with p53CD or NFkB peptides for binding the ASPP2 n-src loop. However, p53CD displaced the NFκB peptide (residues 303-332) from its complex with ASPP2 Ank-SH3, indicating that NFκB 303-332 and p53CD bind a partly overlapping site in ASPP2 SH3, mostly in the RT loop. These results are in agreement with previous docking studies, which showed that ASPP2 Ank-SH3 binds Bcl-2 and NFκB mostly via distinct sites from p53. However they show some overlap between the binding sites of p53CD and NFkB in ASPP2 Ank-SH3. Our results provide experimental evidence that the intramolecular interaction in ASPP2 regulates its binding to p53CD and that ASPP2 Ank-SH3 binds Bcl-2 and NFκB via distinct sites.	0
[Study on the causes of deafness in a consanguineous marriage family using DNA microarray]. || Connexin 26 Connexins Consanguinity Deafness Female Heterozygote Humans Male Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Pedigree Young Adult || To determine the possible gene mutation and its different sites that leads to hearing loss in a consanguineous marriage pedigree. Blood samples from a Changchun pedigree were obtained with informed consent. Their genomic DNA were extracted from peripheral blood and PCR was performed. Nine of hot spot mutations in four most common deafness pathologic gene were detected with the DNA microarray, including GJB2, GJB3, PDS and mtDNA 12S RNA gene. At the same time, the results were confirmed with the traditional methods of sequencing. GJB2 gene of 235 delC and 299-300 delAT compound heterozygous mutation was found in propositus. His father was 299-300 delAT homozygous mutation and mother was 235 delC homozygous mutation. In the relatives on the paternal side, the affected patients all were 299-300 delAT homozygous mutation and normal hearing member was 299-300 delAT heterozygous carrier. This GJB2 mutation come from grandparents of consanguineous marriage. GJB2 gene mutation played on an important role in this deafness family. It is essential approach for genetic diagnosis of non - syndromic sensorineural hearing loss.	4
Hyperphenylalaninemia in the Czech Republic: genotype-phenotype correlations and in silico analysis of novel missense mutations. || Computational Biology Computer Simulation Czech Republic Genetic Association Studies Genotype Humans Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation, Missense Phenotype Phenylketonurias || Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders caused by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). HPA is associated with mutations in the PAH gene, which leads to reduced protein stability and/or impaired catalytic function. Currently, almost 700 different disease-causing mutations have been described. The impact of mutations on enzyme activity varies ranging from classical PKU, mild PKU, to non-PKU HPA phenotype. We provide results of molecular genetic diagnostics of 665 Czech unrelated HPA patients, structural analysis of missense mutations associated with classical PKU and non-PKU HPA phenotype, and prediction of effects of 6 newly discovered HPA missense mutations using bioinformatic approaches and Molecular Dynamics simulations. Ninety-eight different types of mutations were indentified. Thirteen of these were novel (6 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 splicing, and 4 small gene rearrangements). Structural analysis revealed that classical PKU mutations are more non-conservative compared to non-PKU HPA mutations and that specific sequence and structural characteristics of a mutation might be critical when distinguishing between non-PKU HPA and classical PKU mutations. The greatest impact was predicted for the p.(Phe263Ser) mutation while other novel mutations p.(Asn167Tyr), p.(Thr200Asn), p.(Asp229Gly), p.(Leu358Phe), and p.(Ile406Met) were found to be less deleterious.	1 3
MYH7-related myopathies: clinical, histopathological and imaging findings in a cohort of Italian patients. || Adolescent Adult Aged Cardiac Myosins Child Child, Preschool Female Genotype Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Lower Extremity Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal Muscular Diseases Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Pedigree Phenotype Young Adult || Myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7)-related myopathies are emerging as an important group of muscle diseases of childhood and adulthood, with variable clinical and histopathological expression depending on the type and location of the mutation. Mutations in the head and neck domains are a well-established cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy whereas mutation in the distal regions have been associated with a range of skeletal myopathies with or without cardiac involvement, including Laing distal myopathy and Myosin storage myopathy. Recently the spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with mutations in MYH7 has increased, blurring this scheme and adding further phenotypes to the list. A broader disease spectrum could lead to misdiagnosis of different congenital myopathies, neurogenic atrophy and other neuromuscular conditions. As a result of a multicenter Italian study we collected clinical, histopathological and imaging data from a population of 21 cases from 15 families, carrying reported or novel mutations in MYH7. Patients displayed a variable phenotype including atypical pictures, as dropped head and bent spine, which cannot be classified in previously described groups. Half of the patients showed congenital or early infantile weakness with predominant distal weakness. Conversely, patients with later onset present prevalent proximal weakness. Seven patients were also affected by cardiomyopathy mostly in the form of non-compacted left ventricle. Muscle biopsy was consistent with minicores myopathy in numerous cases. Muscle MRI was meaningful in delineating a shared pattern of selective involvement of tibialis anterior muscles, with relative sparing of quadriceps. This work adds to the genotype-phenotype correlation of MYH7-relatedmyopathies confirming the complexity of the disorder.	4
Alterations of EGFR, p53 and PTEN that mimic changes found in basal-like breast cancer promote transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. || Animals Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Epidermal Growth Factor ErbB Receptors Female Gene Expression Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockout Techniques Humans Mice Models, Biological Neoplasms, Basal Cell PTEN Phosphohydrolase Signal Transduction Transplantation, Heterologous Tumor Stem Cell Assay Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Breast cancer can be classified into different molecular subtypes with varying clinical and pathological characteristics. The basal-like breast cancer subtype represents one of the most aggressive and lethal types of breast cancer, and due to poor mechanistic understanding, it lacks targeted therapy. Many basal-like breast cancer patient samples display alterations of established drivers of cancer development, including elevated expression of EGFR, p53 inactivating mutations and loss of expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN; however, their contribution to human basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis remains ill-defined. Using non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells, we set out to determine whether altering EGFR, p53 and PTEN in different combinations could contribute to basal-like breast cancer progression through transformation of cells. Altering PTEN in combination with either p53 or EGFR in contrast to any of the single alterations caused increased growth of transformed colonies in soft agar. Concomitantly modifying all three genes led to the highest rate of cellular proliferation and the greatest degree of anchorage-independent colony formation. Results from our effort to engineer a model of BBC expressing alterations of EGFR, p53 and PTEN suggest that these changes are cooperative and likely play a causal role in basal-like breast cancer pathogenesis. Consideration should be given to targeting EGFR and restoring p53 and PTEN signaling simultaneously as a strategy for treatment of this subtype of breast cancer.	0
Oncomorphic TP53 Mutations in Gynecologic Cancers Lose the Normal Protein:Protein Interactions with the microRNA Microprocessing Complex. ||  || Mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53 occur in almost all advanced ovarian cancers and in many advanced serous endometrial cancers. Mutations inTP53 can alter the function of the p53 protein, and some mutations result in a mutated protein with oncogenic activity. Previously referred to as gain of function (GOF) p53 proteins, we now term these "oncomorphic" mutations to better describe their function as oncogenes. We reviewed the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and demonstrate that of the patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer that harborTP53 mutations, approximately 30% of these mutations are oncomorphic. In ovarian cancer, approximately 20% are oncomorphic. The wild type (WT) p53 protein transactivates genes and micro- RNAs (miRNAs) necessary in the response to cellular stress, which turn off growth and induce apoptosis. In addition to direct transcriptional activation, WT p53 also acts through protein:protein interactions with Drosha and the miRNA processing complex to mediate rapid, enhanced processing of a subset of anti-growth miRNAs. We validated the interaction of WT p53 with the Drosha complex in the cell line UCI-107. We observed that miRNAs that inhibit the expression of oncogenes were induced. Specifically, some miRNAs were induced very rapidly over minutes, consistent with enhanced processing, while others required hours, consistent with transcriptional activation. In contrast, the most common oncomorphicTP53 mutations failed to interact with the Drosha complex and lost the ability to rapidly induce the miRNAs which inhibit oncogene expression. These studies highlight one mechanism underlying the oncomorphic properties of specificTP53 mutations: loss of the enhanced processing of anti-proliferative miRNAs.	0
Identification of putative pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in genes associated with heart disease in 290 cases of stillbirth. ||  || The incidence of stillbirth in Sweden has essentially remained constant since the 1980's, and despite thorough investigation, many cases remain unexplained. It has been suggested that a proportion of stillbirth cases is caused by heart disease, mainly channelopathies. The aim of this study was to analyze DNA from 290 stillbirth cases without chromosomal abnormalities for pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 70 genes associated with cardiac channelopathies and cardiomyopathies. The HaloPlex Target Enrichment System (Agilent Technologies) was utilized to prepare sequencing libraries which were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform. We found that 12.1% of the 290 investigated stillbirth cases had one (n = 31) or two (n = 4) variants with evidence supporting pathogenicity, i.e. loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site substitutions), evidence from functional studies, or previous identification of the variants in affected individuals. Regarding identified putative pathogenic variants in genes associated with channelopathies, the prevalence was significantly higher in the stillbirth cohort (n = 23, 7.93%) than the corresponding prevalence of the same variants in the non-Finnish European population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (2.70%, p<0.001) and SweGen, (2.30%, p<0.001). Our results give further support to the hypothesis that cardiac channelopathies might contribute to stillbirth. Screening for pathogenic SNVs in genes associated with heart disease might be a valuable complement for stillbirth cases where today's conventional investigation does not reveal the underlying cause of fetal demise.	4
Lavage of the Uterine Cavity for Molecular Detection of Müllerian Duct Carcinomas: A Proof-of-Concept Study. || Adult Aged Carcinoma Early Detection of Cancer Endometrial Neoplasms Female Humans Middle Aged Mullerian Ducts Mutation Neoplasms, Unknown Primary Ovarian Neoplasms Pilot Projects Polymerase Chain Reaction Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Therapeutic Irrigation Uterus || Type II ovarian cancer (OC) and endometrial cancer (EC) are generally diagnosed at an advanced stage, translating into a poor survival rate. There is increasing evidence that Müllerian duct cancers may exfoliate cells. We have established an approach for lavage of the uterine cavity to detect shed cancer cells. Lavage of the uterine cavity was used to obtain samples from 65 patients, including 30 with OC, five with EC, three with other malignancies, and 27 with benign lesions involving gynecologic organs. These samples, as well as corresponding tumor tissue, were examined for the presence of somatic mutations using massively parallel sequencing (next-generation sequencing) and, in a subset, singleplex analysis. The lavage technique could be applied successfully, and sufficient amounts of DNA were obtained in all patients. Mutations, mainly in TP53, were identified in 18 (60%) of 30 lavage samples of patients with OC using next-generation sequencing. Singleplex analysis of mutations previously determined in corresponding tumor tissue led to further identification of six patients. Taken together, in 24 (80%) of 30 patients with OC, specific mutations could be identified. This also included one patient with occult OC. All five analyzed lavage specimens from patients with EC harbored mutations. Eight (29.6%) of 27 patients with benign lesions tested positive for mutations, six (75%) as a result of mutations in the KRAS gene. This study proved that tumor cells from ovarian neoplasms are shed and can be collected via lavage of the uterine cavity. Detection of OC and EC and even clinically occult OC was achieved, making it a potential tool of significant promise for early diagnosis.	4
ClinVar: improving access to variant interpretations and supporting evidence. ||  || ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) is a freely available, public archive of human genetic variants and interpretations of their significance to disease, maintained at the National Institutes of Health. Interpretations of the clinical significance of variants are submitted by clinical testing laboratories, research laboratories, expert panels and other groups. ClinVar aggregates data by variant-disease pairs, and by variant (or set of variants). Data aggregated by variant are accessible on the website, in an improved set of variant call format files and as a new comprehensive XML report. ClinVar recently started accepting submissions that are focused primarily on providing phenotypic information for individuals who have had genetic testing. Submissions may come from clinical providers providing their own interpretation of the variant ('provider interpretation') or from groups such as patient registries that primarily provide phenotypic information from patients ('phenotyping only'). ClinVar continues to make improvements to its search and retrieval functions. Several new fields are now indexed for more precise searching, and filters allow the user to narrow down a large set of search results.	4
Clinical characteristics associated with BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutations in Japanese melanoma patients. || Aged Asian Continental Ancestry Group Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Japan Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Skin Skin Neoplasms || The importance of the genetic background of melanoma cells to the individual susceptibility to treatment has become apparent. In Caucasians, BRAF mutations are frequently detected in lesions on the skin of younger patients compared to NRAS and KIT mutations. However, clinical and pathological characteristics associated with BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutations have not been fully evaluated in East Asians. To clarify clinical and pathological characteristics associated with BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutations in Japanese melanoma patients. Clinical data were retrospectively collected from 11 hospitals in Japan. BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutations were evaluated with polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. The relationships between these gene mutations and pathological and clinical findings were analyzed. The number of cases examined was 171 (primary: 135, metastases: 11, paired: 25), and all were Japanese patients. The detection rates of BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutations were 30.4%, 12.3% and 12.9%, respectively. Compared with the wild type, the presence of BRAF mutations was significantly associated with younger age (median, 50.0 years vs. 70.0 years, p<0.001). BRAF mutation was frequently detected in the lesions of the scalp (80%; 4/5), trunk (72.0%; 18/25), extremities (56.7%; 17/30) and neck (44.4%; 4/9), and the least prevalent were the face (22.2%; 2/9), nail (12.5%; 3/24), palm or sole (8.9%; 4/45) and mucosa (0%). NRAS mutations were prevalent in the face (33.3%) and palm or sole (20.0%), and the median age of these patients was 70.5 years. A KIT mutation was observed in the nail apparatus (25%), palm or sole (15.6%) and mucosa (18.2%). The median age of the patients with a KIT mutation was 63.0 years. Heterogeneity of mutations between primary and metastatic lesions was detected in six of 25 cases (24%). Solar elastosis was identified in 12 of 71 cases (15.3%), among which four cases harbored BRAF(V600E) (2 cases), BRAF(V600K), NRAS(Q61K) or NRAS(Q61L), respectively. Some clinical characteristics associated with BRAF, NRAS and KIT mutations were observed in Japanese patients, and we observed both similarities to and differences from those of Caucasians. Our findings could provide useful information in efforts to clarify the tumor genesis of malignant melanomas.	4
Combination of hearing screening and genetic screening for deafness-susceptibility genes in newborns. ||  || The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the results of screening of newborn hearing and the incidence of deafness-susceptibility genes. One thousand newborn babies in the Handan Center Hospital (Handan, China) underwent screening of hearing and deafness-susceptibility genes. The first screening test was carried out using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). Babies with hearing loss who failed to pass the initial screening were scheduled for rescreening at 42 days after birth. Cord blood was used for the screening of deafness-susceptibility genes, namely the GJB2, SLC26A4 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA (MTRNR1) genes. Among the 1,000 neonates that underwent the first hearing screening, 25 exhibited left-sided hearing loss, 21 exhibited right-sided hearing loss and 15 cases had binaural hearing loss. After rescreening 42 days later, only one of the initial 61 cases exhibited hearing loss under OAE testing. The neonatal deafness gene tests showed two cases with 1555A>G mutation and two cases with 1494C>T mutation of the MTRNR1 gene. In the SLC26A4 gene screening, four cases exhibited the heterozygous IVS7-2A>G mutation and one case exhibited heterozygous 1226G>A mutation. In the GJB2 gene screening, two cases exhibited the homozygous 427C>T mutation and 10 exhibited the heterozygous 235delC mutation. The genetic screening revealed 21 newborns with mutations in the three deafness-susceptibility genes. The overall carrier rate was 2.1% (21/1,000). The association of hearing and gene screening may be the promising screening strategy for the diagnosis of hearing loss.	4
Sarcomere mutations in cardiomyopathy with left ventricular hypertrabeculation. || Cardiac Myosins Carrier Proteins Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular Infant Infant, Newborn Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Pedigree Sarcomeres Ultrasonography || Mutations in the genes encoding sarcomere proteins have been associated with both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. Recently, mutations in myosin heavy chain (MYH7), cardiac actin (ACTC), and troponin T (TNNT2) were associated with left ventricular noncompaction, a form of cardiomyopathy characterized with hypertrabeculation that may also include reduced function of the left ventricle. We used clinically available genetic testing on 3 cases referred for evaluation of left ventricular dysfunction and noncompaction of the left ventricle and found that all 3 individuals carried sarcomere mutations. The first patient presented with neonatal heart failure and was referred for left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Genetic testing found 2 different mutations in MYBPC3 in trans. The first mutation, 3776delA, Q1259fs, rendered a frame shift at 1259 of cardiac myosin-binding protein C and the second mutation was L1200P. The frameshift mutation was also found in this mother who displayed mild echocardiographic features of cardiomyopathy, with only subtle increase in trabeculation and an absence of hypertrophy. A second pediatric patient presented with heart failure and was found to carry a de novo MYH7 R369Q mutation. The third case was an adult patient with dilated cardiomyopathy referred for ventricular hypertrabeculation. This patient had a family history of congestive heart failure, including pediatric onset cardiomyopathy where 3 individuals in the family were found to have the MYH7 mutation R1250W. Genetic testing should be considered for cardiomyopathy with hypertrabeculation.	4
Serial Next-Generation Sequencing of Circulating Cell-Free DNA Evaluating Tumor Clone Response To Molecularly Targeted Drug Administration. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor DNA, Complementary DNA, Neoplasm Disease Progression Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplastic Cells, Circulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases ras Proteins || We evaluated whether next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) could be used for patient selection and as a tumor clone response biomarker in patients with advanced cancers participating in early-phase clinical trials of targeted drugs. Plasma samples from patients with known tumor mutations who completed at least two courses of investigational targeted therapy were collected monthly, until disease progression. NGS was performed sequentially on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. cfDNA was extracted from 39 patients with various tumor types. Treatments administered targeted mainly the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (n = 28) or MEK (n = 7). Overall, 159 plasma samples were sequenced with a mean sequencing coverage achieved of 1,685X across experiments. At trial initiation (C1D1), 23 of 39 (59%) patients had at least one mutation identified in cfDNA (mean 2, range 1-5). Out of the 44 mutations identified at C1D1, TP53, PIK3CA and KRAS were the top 3 mutated genes identified, with 18 (41%), 9 (20%), 8 (18%) different mutations, respectively. Out of these 23 patients, 13 received a targeted drug matching their tumor profile. For the 23 patients with cfDNA mutation at C1D1, the monitoring of mutation allele frequency (AF) in consecutive plasma samples during treatment with targeted drugs demonstrated potential treatment associated clonal responses. Longitudinal monitoring of cfDNA samples with multiple mutations indicated the presence of separate clones behaving discordantly. Molecular changes at cfDNA mutation level were associated with time to disease progression by RECIST criteria. Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential clinical utility to monitor the delivery of targeted therapies.	4
Clinical strategies for acquired epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. ||  || Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (EGFRm+) occur in 10-35% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).EGFR TKIs are standard treatments for NSCLC patients harboringEGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R point mutations. Despite initial benefit, most patients develop drug resistance, posing a challenge to oncologists. The secondary T790M point mutation inEGFR exon 20 contributes to approximately 60% of resistance cases. Optimum strategies for overcoming acquired EGFR TKI resistance are not clearly defined, although current common practice is to switch to platinum-based chemotherapy following resistance onset. While the second-generation EGFR TKIs, including afatinib, dacomitinib, and neratinib, exhibit promising preclinical activity against T790M mutants, dose-limiting toxicities in patients have limited clinical success. However, third generation EGFR TKIs appear able to overcome this mutation. Other treatment options aimed at EGFR TKI resistance include use of an EGFR TKI beyond progression, and chemotherapy plus an EGFR TKI. This review focuses on improved anticancer agents and therapy options for NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance.	4
Genetic variations of β-MYH7 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. || Diastolic dysfunction dilated cardiomyopathy dose effect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy single nucleotide polymorphism systolic dysfunction || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is known to be manifested by mutations in 12 sarcomeric genes and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is known to manifest due to cytoskeletal mutations. Studies have revealed that sarcomeric mutations can also lead to DCM. Therefore, in the present study, we have made an attempt to compare and analyze the genetic variations of beta-myosin heavy chain gene (β-MYH7), which are interestingly found to be common in both HCM and DCM. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism leading to two different phenotypes has been discussed in this study. Till date, about 186 and 73 different mutations have been reported in HCM and DCM, respectively, with respect to this gene. The screening of β-MYH7 gene in both HCM and DCM has revealed some common genetic variations. The aim of the present study is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the manifestation of two different phenotypes. 100 controls, 95 HCM and 97 DCM samples were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted following rapid nonenzymatic method as described by Lahiri and Nurnberger (1991), and the extracted DNA was later subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s/mutations associated with the diseased phenotypes. Similar variations were observed in β-MYH7 exons 7, 12, 19 and 20 in both HCM and DCM. This could be attributed to impaired energy compromise, or to dose effect of the mutant protein, or to even environmental factors/modifier gene effects wherein an HCM could progress to a DCM phenotype affecting both right and left ventricles, leading to heart failure.	4
Modeling of Halogen-Protein Interactions in Co-Solvent Molecular Dynamics Simulations. ||  || Co-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have recently become successful approaches in structure-based drug design but neglect important interactions such as halogen bonding. To be able to successfully model compound libraries containing halogenated ligands using co-solvent simulations, we investigate the use of halogenated benzene probes in co-solvent simulations on the two test systems human cathepsin L (hCatL) and the Y220C mutant of the tumor suppressor p53 (p53-Y220C). Our studies demonstrate that halogenated benzene probes indeed can unambiguously identify halogen-bonding interaction sites in the binding pocket and show superior correlation and ranking performance compared to standard co-solvent approaches.	0
[Comparison of genotype and intellectual phenotype in untreated phenylketonuric children]. ||  || The main feature of phenylketonuria(PKU) is mental retardation. Although classical PKU is defined as that the hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity ranges 0-1% of normal enzyme, the untreated PKU patients show a wide range of intellectual phenotype. This study sought to find the molecular basis of such variation of intellectual phenotype among PKU. 45 classical PKU patients included in the research were screened for detecting six mutant alleles which were rather common among Chinese PKU patients, i.e. R243Q, R413P, Y204C, Y356X, W326X and R111X. PCR-ASO and PCR-SSCP techniques were used. The expression of those mutant PAH genes was analysed by methods of site-directed mutagencies. 27 PKU patients whose two mutant alleles were both defined were involved in this study. The IQ of these patients were tested by DDST system. Among 27 patients, 4/27 (15%) were mild retardation, 10/27(37%) were moderate, the severe mental retardation accounted for 12/27(44%). The relationship between genotype and intellectual phenotype in this group was examined. It was found that the intellectual phenotype of 8 patients were compatible with genotype but not well matched in 19 cases. The enzyme activity of Y204C expressed in vitro was 100%, but all 3 patients with Y204C/Y204C were severely mental retarded. Enzyme activities of R413P and Y356X were <3% and 0 respectively in expression analysis, but the patients in this group had mild or moderate mental retardation. Intellectual phenotype was not well matched with the genotype in classical PKU patients, so that genotype can not be used to predicte the intellectual phenotype in PKU patients.	1 3
SAHA shows preferential cytotoxicity in mutant p53 cancer cells by destabilizing mutant p53 through inhibition of the HDAC6-Hsp90 chaperone axis. || Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Survival Clinical Trials as Topic Down-Regulation Enzyme Activation HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins Histone Deacetylase 6 Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Histone Deacetylases Humans Hydroxamic Acids Inhibitory Concentration 50 Leupeptins Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutant Proteins Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Proteasome Inhibitors Protein Stability Proteolysis Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases Vorinostat || Mutant p53 (mutp53) cancers are surprisingly dependent on their hyperstable mutp53 protein for survival, identifying mutp53 as a potentially significant clinical target. However, exploration of effective small molecule therapies targeting mutp53 has barely begun. Mutp53 hyperstabilization, a hallmark of p53 mutation, is cancer cell-specific and due to massive upregulation of the HSP90 chaperone machinery during malignant transformation. We recently showed that stable complex formation between HSP90 and its mutp53 client inhibits E3 ligases MDM2 and CHIP, causing mutp53 stabilization. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) are a new class of promising anti-cancer drugs, hyperacetylating histone and non-histone targets. Currently, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is the only FDA-approved HDACi. We show that SAHA exhibits preferential cytotoxicity for mutant, rather than wild-type and null p53 human cancer cells. Loss/gain-of-function experiments revealed that although able to exert multiple cellular effects, SAHA's cytotoxicity is caused to a significant degree by its ability to strongly destabilize mutp53 at the level of protein degradation. The underlying mechanism is SAHA's inhibition of HDAC6, an essential positive regulator of HSP90. This releases mutp53 and enables its MDM2- and CHIP-mediated degradation. SAHA also strongly chemosensitizes mutp53 cancer cells for chemotherapy due to its ability to degrade mutp53. This identifies a novel action of SAHA with the prospect of SAHA becoming a centerpiece in mutp53-specific anticancer strategies.	0
Ryanodine receptor gene point mutation and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. || Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence Biopsy Calcium Channels Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Malignant Hyperthermia Molecular Sequence Data Muscle Contraction Muscle Proteins Muscles Pedigree Point Mutation Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel || Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare clinical syndrome, triggered in susceptible subjects by a variety of anaesthetic agents and muscle relaxants, and is the commonest cause of death due to general anaesthesia. Previous studies have reported that inherited mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene co-segregated, in some families, with MH susceptibility; lack of linkage between MH and the RYR1 gene in some other families indicates a heterogenous genetic basis for the syndrome. The in vitro contracture test (IVCT) on muscle biopsy specimens is considered to be the most reliable test for establishing the diagnosis of MH. With the identification of RYR1 point mutations this might in turn result in non-invasive methods for the presymptomatic diagnosis of MH. In the present study we investigated four families suspected to be at risk of MH susceptibility; in all subjects histopathological examination and IVCT were performed on muscle biopsy specimens. We undertook a mutation analysis of RYR1 gene testing for the presence of five point mutations; in one pedigree a C1840-->T point mutation was detected, strictly segregating with in vitro MH susceptibility.	4
Drugging Ras GTPase: a comprehensive mechanistic and signaling structural view. || Allosteric Regulation Antineoplastic Agents Catalytic Domain Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases RNA, Small Interfering ras Proteins || Ras proteins are small GTPases, cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. Through these switches they regulate signaling that controls cell growth and proliferation. Activating Ras mutations are associated with approximately 30% of human cancers, which are frequently resistant to standard therapies. Over the past few years, structural biology and in silico drug design, coupled with improved screening technology, led to a handful of promising inhibitors, raising the possibility of drugging Ras proteins. At the same time, the invariable emergence of drug resistance argues for the critical importance of additionally honing in on signaling pathways which are likely to be involved. Here we overview current advances in Ras structural knowledge, including the conformational dynamic of full-length Ras in solution and at the membrane, therapeutic inhibition of Ras activity by targeting its active site, allosteric sites, and Ras-effector protein-protein interfaces, Ras dimers, the K-Ras4B/calmodulin/PI3Kα trimer, and targeting Ras with siRNA. To mitigate drug resistance, we propose signaling pathways that can be co-targeted along with Ras and explain why. These include pathways leading to the expression (or activation) of YAP1 and c-Myc. We postulate that these and Ras signaling pathways, MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, act independently and in corresponding ways in cell cycle control. The structural data are instrumental in the discovery and development of Ras inhibitors for treating RAS-driven cancers. Together with the signaling blueprints through which drug resistance can evolve, this review provides a comprehensive and innovative master plan for tackling mutant Ras proteins.	0
Recurrence of the R408W mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in Europeans. || Alleles Ethnic Groups Europe Genes, Recessive Haplotypes History, Ancient History, Medieval Humans Ireland Minisatellite Repeats North America Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Recombination, Genetic Scandinavian and Nordic Countries || The relative frequency of the common phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) mutation R408W and its associations with polymorphic RFLP, VNTR, and short-tandem-repeat (STR) sites in the PAH gene were examined in many European populations and one representative North American population of defined European descent. This mutation was found to cluster in two regions: in northwest Europe among Irish and Scottish peoples, and in eastern Europe, including the Commonwealth of Independent States. This allele was significantly less frequent in intervening populations. In eastern European populations, the R408W mutation is strongly associated with RFLP haplotype 2, the three-copy VNTR allele (VNTR 3), and the 240-bp STR allele. In northwestern European populations, it is strongly associated with RFLP haplotype 1, the VNTR allele containing eight repeats (VNTR 8), and the 244-bp STR allele. An examination of the linkage between the R408W mutation and highly polymorphic RFLP, VNTR, and STR haplotypes suggests that recurrence is the most likely mechanism to account for the two different major haplotype associations of R408W in Europe.	3
Neonatal detection of the 35delG mutation of the GJB2 gene in families at risk for deafness. || Cochlea Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem Female Fetal Diseases Humans Infant, Newborn Male Neonatal Screening Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous Point Mutation Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis Prospective Studies Risk Factors || About half of congenitally deaf children that have a recessively inherited sensorineural deafness are born from normal-hearing parents and have no risk factor for hearing loss. Mutation 35delG in the connexin-26 gene is in European populations the basis for around half of all recessively inherited prelingual sensorineural deafness. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and utility of the 35delG mutation of the connexin-26 gene analysis for neonates at familial risk, from DNA isolated from Guthrie newborn screening cards. Newborns who had consanguineous parent and/or a familial history of deafness underwent connexin-26 gene analysis from DNA isolated from Guthrie cards and two hearing screening tests (transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, and auditory brainstem recordings). 24 newborns were includes in this pilot study; one of them is homozygous for the 35delG mutation and had abnormal hearing screening tests; all the others newborns had normal connexin gene and at least one normal hearing screening test. Detection on connexin-26 gene mutation is feasible in selected at-risk newborns on one additional blood spot on Guthrie card.	4
Rapid detection of genetic mutations in individual breast cancer patients by next-generation DNA sequencing. || Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Precision Medicine Receptor, ErbB-2 || Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Breast cancers are heterogenous and exist in many different subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, triple negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing), and each subtype displays distinct characteristics, responses to treatment, and patient outcomes. In addition to varying immunohistochemical properties, each subtype contains a distinct gene mutation profile which has yet to be fully defined. Patient treatment is currently guided by hormone receptor status and HER2 expression, but accumulating evidence suggests that genetic mutations also influence drug responses and patient survival. Thus, identifying the unique gene mutation pattern in each breast cancer subtype will further improve personalized treatment and outcomes for breast cancer patients. In this study, we used the Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Panel to sequence 737 mutational hotspot regions from 45 cancer-related genes to identify genetic mutations in 80 breast cancer samples of various subtypes from Chinese patients. Analysis revealed frequent missense and combination mutations in PIK3CA and TP53, infrequent mutations in PTEN, and uncommon combination mutations in luminal-type cancers in other genes including BRAF, GNAS, IDH1, and KRAS. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using Ion Torrent sequencing technology to reliably detect gene mutations in a clinical setting in order to guide personalized drug treatments or combination therapies to ultimately target individual, breast cancer-specific mutations.	4
Novel pathogenic variant in the HRAS gene with lethal outcome and a broad phenotypic spectrum among Polish patients with Costello syndrome. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Costello Syndrome Fatal Outcome Female Genetic Association Studies Humans Infant Male Mutation, Missense Phenotype Poland Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare congenital disorder from the group of RASopathies, characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, failure to thrive, cardiac and skin anomalies, intellectual disability, and a predisposition to neoplasia. CS is associated with germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS, a small GTPase from the Ras family. In this study, a molecular and clinical analysis was carried out in eight Polish patients with the Costello phenotype. A molecular test showed two known heterozygous mutations in the first coding exon of the gene in seven patients: p.G12S (n=4) and p.G12A (n=3), and a novel pathogenic variant p.G60V in one child with an unusually severe, lethal course of the syndrome. In addition, a fatal course of CS was present in one patient with the p.G12A mutation and in another with p.G12S, there was a co-occurrence of Turner syndrome because of the distal Xp deletion. A severe clinical manifestation with a lethal outcome in an individual with p.G60V in HRAS and contrary observations of an attenuated phenotype in CS patients with other mutations at glycine-60 residue may suggest that the nature of the substituted amino acid plays a significant role in the clinical variability observed in some CS cases.	4
Whole-exome sequencing identifies common and rare variant metabolic QTLs in a Middle Eastern population. || Adult Arabs Chromosome Mapping Cohort Studies Consanguinity Exome Female Genetic Variation Genome-Wide Association Study Genotype High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Metabolome Middle Aged Middle East Quantitative Trait Loci || Metabolomics-genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) have uncovered many metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) influencing human metabolic individuality, though predominantly in European cohorts. By combining whole-exome sequencing with a high-resolution metabolomics profiling for a highly consanguineous Middle Eastern population, we discover 21 common variant and 12 functional rare variant mQTLs, of which 45% are novel altogether. We fine-map 10 common variant mQTLs to new metabolite ratio associations, and 11 common variant mQTLs to putative protein-altering variants. This is the first work to report common and rare variant mQTLs linked to diseases and/or pharmacological targets in a consanguineous Arab cohort, with wide implications for precision medicine in the Middle East.	4
Themis is a member of a new metazoan gene family and is required for the completion of thymocyte positive selection. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes Cell Differentiation Cell Line Cell Lineage Cell Survival Ethylnitrosourea Female Humans Mice Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Proteins Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell Signal Transduction || T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling in CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes determines cell survival and lineage commitment, but the genetic and molecular basis of this process is poorly defined. To address this issue, we used ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis to identify a previously unknown T lineage-specific gene, Themis, which is critical for the completion of positive selection. Themis contains a tandem repeat of a unique globular domain (called 'CABIT' here) that includes a cysteine motif that defines a family of five uncharacterized vertebrate proteins with orthologs in most animal species. Themis-deficient thymocytes showed no substantial impairment in early TCR signaling but did show altered expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and survival before and during positive selection. Our data suggest a unique function for Themis in sustaining positive selection.	0
microRNAs: short non-coding bullets of gain of function mutant p53 proteins. ||  || TP53 gene mutations are present in more than half of all human cancers. The resulting proteins are mostly full-length with a single aminoacid change and are abundantly present in cancer cells. Some of mutant p53 proteins gain oncogenic activities through which actively contribute to the aberrant cell proliferation, increased resistance to apoptotic stimuli and ability to metastatize of cancer cells. Gain of function mutant p53 proteins can transcriptionally regulate the expression of a large plethora of target genes. This mainly occurs through the formation of oncogenic transcriptional competent complexes that include mutant p53 protein, known transcription factors, posttranslational modifiers and scaffold proteins. Mutant p53 protein can also transcriptionally regulate the expression of microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Each microRNA can putatively target the expression of hundred mRNAs and consequently impact on many cellular functions. Thus, gain of function mutant p53 proteins can exert their oncogenic activities through the modulation of both non-coding and coding regions of human genome.	0
High frequency of ras oncogene activation in all stages of human thyroid tumorigenesis. || Adenoma Adolescent Adult Aged Carcinoma Female Gene Amplification Genes, ras Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Thyroid Neoplasms || Using polymerase chain reaction amplification and oligonucleotide probing, the activation of ras oncogenes in 24 benign and 20 malignant human thyroid neoplasms was examined. The frequency of ras oncogene activation was similar at all stages of tumorigenesis in this system, being found in 33% of adenomas overall (50% of microfollicular tumours), 53% of differentiated follicular carcinomas and 60% of undifferentiated carcinomas. This supports the contention that mutation of these oncogenes occurs at an early step in tumorigenesis. The predominant amino acid substitution in the differentiated tumours was glutamine to arginine at position 61 of Ha-ras or N-ras, but this mutation was not found in any of the undifferentiated tumours. It was noted that while transition mutations predominated in differentiated tumours (both benign and malignant), transversions were more common in the undifferentiated tumours.	4
The relationship of genotype to phenotype in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. || Adult Age Factors Diet Genotype Humans Intelligence Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || Seventy-two adults with phenylketonuria were evaluated to investigate the genotypic relationship to phenotype. Patient data were collected by chart review and medical follow-up as well as current psychological evaluation. Nineteen diagnosed neonatally had remained on a phenylalanine-restricted diet all their lives, whereas 34 who were also diagnosed on newborn screening had discontinued dietary restriction during childhood. Nineteen others who were born prior to newborn screening were diagnosed later than the newborn period on clinical grounds but have remained on dietary restriction. Comparison between intellectual ability, academic achievement, and mental illness was made with degree of diet control as defined by range of blood phenylalanine levels over time. Diet discontinuation in childhood did not significantly lower IQ per se but appeared to diminish academic achievement. The lowest IQ scores were associated with poor dietary restriction of phenylalanine in the diet during childhood. While there appears to be a strong genotypic relationship to phenotypic metabolic parameters in phenylketonuria, there does not seem to be a similar relationship to intellectual ability in adults. Mutation R408W was not strongly related to the occurrence of mental illness in this sample. We conclude that dietary restriction of phenylalanine neonatally and good control contributed to normal intellectual development. Continuation of dietary treatment into adulthood appeared to improve academic achievement in patients with severe phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations.	1 3
Multi-gene panel testing for hereditary cancer predisposition in unsolved high-risk breast and ovarian cancer patients. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Checkpoint Kinase 2 DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Humans Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Ovarian Neoplasms Risk Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases Young Adult || Many women with an elevated risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer have previously tested negative for pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Among them, a subset has hereditary susceptibility to cancer and requires further testing. We sought to identify specific groups who remain at high risk and evaluate whether they should be offered multi-gene panel testing. We tested 300 women on a multi-gene panel who were previously enrolled in a long-term study at UCSF. As part of their long-term care, all previously tested negative for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 either by limited or comprehensive sequencing. Additionally, they met one of the following criteria: (i) personal history of bilateral breast cancer, (ii) personal history of breast cancer and a first or second degree relative with ovarian cancer, and (iii) personal history of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. Across the three groups, 26 women (9%) had a total of 28 pathogenic mutations associated with hereditary cancer susceptibility, and 23 women (8%) had mutations in genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2. Ashkenazi Jewish and Hispanic women had elevated pathogenic mutation rates. In addition, two women harbored pathogenic mutations in more than one hereditary predisposition gene. Among women at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer who have previously tested negative for pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, we identified three groups of women who should be considered for subsequent multi-gene panel testing. The identification of women with multiple pathogenic mutations has important implications for family testing.	4
Costello syndrome with severe nodulocystic acne: unexpected significant improvement of acanthosis nigricans after oral isotretinoin treatment. ||  || We report the case of 17-year-old female diagnosed with Costello syndrome. Genetic testing provided a proof with G12S mutation in the HRAS gene since 3 years of age with a presentation of severe nodulocystic acne on her face. After 2 months of oral isotretinoin treatment, improvement in her acne was observed. Interestingly, an unexpected significant improvement of acanthosis nigricans on her neck and dorsum of her hands was found as well. We present this case as a successful treatment option by using oral isotretinoin for the treatment of acanthosis nigricans in Costello syndrome patients.	4
Contribution of the GSTP1 c.313A>G variant to hearing loss risk in patients exposed to platin chemotherapy during childhood. ||  || Ototoxicity is a potential adverse effect of chemotherapy with platin drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, in children. Hearing loss (HL) affecting frequencies below 4 kHz can compromise speech perception. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variants previously implicated in ototoxicity are associated with HL overall and HL below 4 kHz in pediatric oncology patients treated with cisplatin or carboplatin. Patients given cisplatin or carboplatin for a pediatric cancer at least 5 years prior to the start of the study were enrolled. The patients underwent comprehensive audiological evaluations and genotyping to detect the presence of the GJB2 c.35delG, GSTP1 c.313A>G, and MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G polymorphisms. HL was identified in 31/61 patients (50.8%), including 28/42 treated with cisplatin (66.6%) and 3/19 treated with carboplatin (15.8%). HL was associated with higher mean doses of cisplatin (p = .002) and carboplatin (p = .010). The c.313A>G variant of GSTP1 (heterozygous or homozygous) was detected in 31/61 patients (50.8%). An association between this variant allele and HL involving frequencies ≤ 4 kHz was identified (p = .020; 10-fold vs. non-carriers). No associations with HL were observed for GJB2 or MT-RNR1 gene variants. The GSTP1 c.313A>G variant may increase the risk of low-frequency HL in pediatric oncology patients treated with cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy.	4
p53 modulates the activity of the GLI1 oncogene through interactions with the shared coactivator TAF9. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Humans Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors Molecular Sequence Data Nerve Tissue Proteins Nuclear Proteins Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Rats Recombinant Fusion Proteins TATA-Binding Protein Associated Factors Transcription Factor TFIID Transcription Factors Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc Finger Protein GLI1 Zinc Finger Protein Gli2 Zinc Finger Protein Gli3 || The GLI1 oncogene and p53 tumor suppressor gene function in an inhibitory loop that controls stem cell and tumor cell numbers. Since GLI1 and p53 both interact with the coactivator TATA Binding Protein Associated Factor 9 (TAF9), we hypothesized that competition between these transcription factors for TAF9 in cancer cells may contribute to the inhibitory loop and directly affect GLI1 function and cellular phenotype. We showed that TAF9 interacts with the oncogenic GLI family members GLI1 and GLI2 but not GLI3 in cell-free pull-down assays and with GLI1 in rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. Removal of the TAF9-binding acidic alpha helical transactivation domain of GLI1 produced a significant reduction in the ability of GLI1 to transform cells. We then introduced a point mutation into GLI1 (L1052I) that eliminates TAF9 binding and a point mutation into GLI3 (I1510L) that establishes binding. Wild-type and mutant GLI proteins that bind TAF9 showed enhanced transactivating and cell transforming activity compared with those that did not. Therefore, GLI-TAF9 binding appears important for oncogenic activity. We then determined whether wild-type p53 down-regulates GLI function by sequestering TAF9. We showed that p53 binds TAF9 with greater affinity than does GLI1 and that co-expression of p53 with GLI1 or GLI2 down-regulated GLI-induced transactivation, which could be abrogated using mutant forms of GLI1 or p53. This suggests that p53 sequesters TAF9 from GLI1, which may contribute to inhibition of GLI1 activity by p53 and potentially impact therapeutic success of agents targeting GLI-TAF9 interactions in cancer.	0
Frequent HRAS Mutations in Malignant Ectomesenchymoma: Overlapping Genetic Abnormalities With Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma. || Algorithms Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Gene Expression Profiling Humans Immunohistochemistry Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mesenchymoma Polymerase Chain Reaction Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal Transcriptome || Malignant ectomesenchymoma (MEM) is an exceedingly rare pediatric sarcoma with a predilection for infants and young children and is composed of dual malignant mesenchymal and neuroectodermal components. Microscopically, MEM displays areas of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with intermixed neuronal/neuroblastic foci. The molecular alterations associated with MEM and its relationship with embryonal RMS (ERMS) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) have not yet been elucidated. In this study we used whole-transcriptome sequencing in 2 MEM index cases with available frozen tissue, followed by screening of the identified genetic abnormalities in 5 additional cases. No candidate fusion genes were detected by FusionSeq analysis; however, the mutation detection algorithms revealed HRAS and PTPRD hotspot mutations in both index cases, with 1 case harboring an additional FBXW7 mutation. As these mutation profiles have been previously described in ERMS we have tested their incidence in a control group of 7 age-matched ERMS. In addition, the gene signature of MEM was compared with that of RMS, MPNST, and neuronal lineage. All 7 MEM patients were male, with a mean age of 7.5 months (range, 0.6 to 17 mo). All except 1 occurred in the pelvic/urogenital region. Most cases showed ERMS elements, with occasional spindle or undifferentiated/round cell areas. The intermixed neuroectodermal components were mostly scattered ganglion cells, ganglioneuroma, or ganglioneuroblastoma. By Sanger sequencing, 6 of 7 (86%) MEMs had HRAS mutations, with no additional case harboring PTPRD or FBXW7 mutations. The only case lacking HRAS mutation showed neuroblastic micronodules without ganglion cells. The trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) expression, typically lost in MPNST, was retained in all cases. In the control ERMS group, 5 of 7 (71%) showed RAS mutations, equally distributed among NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS genes. The expression profiling of MEM showed upregulation of skeletal muscle and neuronal genes, with no significant overlap with MPNST. Our results of common HRAS mutations and composite gene signature with RMS and neuronal/neuroblastic elements suggest a closer genetic link of MEM to RMS rather than to MPNST.	4
NRAS and EPHB6 mutation rates differ in metastatic melanomas of patients in the North Island versus South Island of New Zealand. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Geography Humans Incidence Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Rate Neoplasm Metastasis New Zealand Receptors, Eph Family Skin Neoplasms Young Adult || Melanoma, the most aggressive skin cancer type, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer related deaths worldwide. Given that New Zealand (NZ) has the world's highest melanoma incidence, we sought to determine the frequency of mutations in NZ melanomas in recurrently mutated genes. NZ melanomas were from localities distributed between North (35°S-42°S) and South Islands (41°S-47°S). A total of 529 melanomas were analyzed for BRAF exon 15 mutations by Sanger sequencing, and also by Sequenom MelaCarta MassARRAY. While, a relatively low incidence of BRAFV600E mutations (23.4%) was observed overall in NZ melanomas, the incidence of NRAS mutations in South Island melanomas was high compared to North Island melanomas (38.3% vs. 21.9%, P=0.0005), and to The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) (38.3% vs. 22%, P=0.0004). In contrast, the incidence of EPHB6G404S mutations was 0% in South Island melanomas, and was 7.8% in North Island (P=0.0002). Overall, these data suggest that melanomas from geographically different regions in NZ have markedly different mutation frequencies, in particular in the NRAS and EPHB6 genes, when compared to TCGA or other populations. These data have implications for the causation and treatment of malignant melanoma in NZ.	4
Associations between mutations and a VNTR in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. || Base Sequence Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Oligodeoxyribonucleotides Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Plasmids Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid Restriction Mapping || The HindIII RFLP in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene is caused by the presence of an AT-rich (70%) minisatellite region. This region contains various multiple of 30-bp tandem repeats and is located 3 kb downstream of the final exon of the gene. PCR-mediated amplification of this region from haplotyped PAH chromosomes indicates that the previously reported 4.0-kb HindIII allele contains three of these repeats, while the 4.4-kb HindIII allele contains 12 of these repeats. The 4.2-kb HindIII fragment can contain six, seven, eight, or nine copies of this repeat. These variations permit more detailed analysis of mutant haplotypes 1, 5, 6, and, possibly, others. Kindred analysis in phenylketonuria families demonstrates Mendelian segregation of these VNTR alleles, as well as associations between these alleles and certain PAH mutations. The R261Q mutation, associated with haplotype 1, is associated almost exclusively with an allele containing eight repeats; the R408W mutation, when occurring on a haplotype 1 background, may also be associated with the eight-repeat VNTR allele. Other PAH mutations associated with haplotype 1, R252W and P281L, do not appear to segregate with specific VNTR alleles. The IVS-10 mutation, when associated with haplotype 6, is associated exclusively with an allele containing seven repeats. The combined use of this VNTR system and the existing RFLP haplotype system will increase the performance of prenatal diagnostic tests based on haplotype analysis. In addition, this VNTR may prove useful in studies concerning the origins and distributions of PAH mutations in different human populations.	3
Pharmacological reactivation of mutant p53: from protein structure to the cancer patient. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Aza Compounds Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic Drug Design Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 tumor suppressor pathway blocks tumor development by triggering apoptosis or cellular senescence in response to oncogenic stress. A large fraction of human tumors carry p53 mutations that disrupt DNA binding of p53 and transcriptional regulation of target genes. Reconstitution of wild-type p53 in vivo triggers rapid elimination of tumors. Therefore, pharmacological reactivation of mutant p53 is a promising strategy for novel cancer therapy. Several approaches for identification of small molecules that target mutant p53 have been applied, including rational design and screening of chemical libraries. The compound PhiKan083 binds with high affinity to a crevice created by the Y220C mutation in p53 and stabilizes the mutant protein. The compound PRIMA-1 (p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis) restores wild-type conformation to mutant p53 by binding to the core and induces apoptosis in human tumor cells. The PRIMA-1 analog APR-246 is currently tested in a clinical trial. Successful development of mutant p53-reactivating anticancer drugs should have a major impact on the treatment of cancer.	0
Design and Characterization of a Human Monoclonal Antibody that Modulates Mutant Connexin 26 Hemichannels Implicated in Deafness and Skin Disorders. ||  || Background: Mutations leading to changes in properties, regulation, or expression of connexin-made channels have been implicated in 28 distinct human hereditary diseases. Eight of these result from variants of connexin 26 (Cx26), a protein critically involved in cell-cell signaling in the inner ear and skin. Lack of non-toxic drugs with defined mechanisms of action poses a serious obstacle to therapeutic interventions for diseases caused by mutant connexins. In particular, molecules that specifically modulate connexin hemichannel function without affecting gap junction channels are considered of primary importance for the study of connexin hemichannel role in physiological as well as pathological conditions. Monoclonal antibodies developed in the last three decades have become the most important class of therapeutic biologicals. Recombinant methods permit rapid selection and improvement of monoclonal antibodies from libraries with large diversity.Methods: By screening a combinatorial library of human single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies expressed in phage, we identified a candidate that binds an extracellular epitope of Cx26. We characterized antibody action using a variety of biochemical and biophysical assays in HeLa cells, organotypic cultures of mouse cochlea and human keratinocyte-derived cells.Results: We determined that the antibody is a remarkably efficient, non-toxic, and completely reversible inhibitor of hemichannels formed by connexin 26 and does not affect direct cell-cell communication via gap junction channels. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the antibody efficiently inhibits hyperative mutant Cx26 hemichannels implicated in autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing impairment accompanied by keratitis and hystrix-like ichthyosis-deafness (KID/HID) syndrome. We solved the crystal structure of the antibody, identified residues that are critical for binding and used molecular dynamics to uncover its mechanism of action.Conclusions: Although further studies will be necessary to validate the effect of the antibodyin vivo, the methodology described here can be extended to select antibodies against hemichannels composed by other connexin isoforms and, consequently, to target other pathologies associated with hyperactive hemichannels. Our study highlights the potential of this approach and identifies connexins as therapeutic targets addressable by screening phage display libraries expressing human randomized antibodies.	0
Variability in phenotype induced by the podocin variant R229Q plus a single pathogenic mutation. ||  || Mutations in podocin (NPHS2) are the most common cause of childhood onset autosomal recessive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). The disease is characterized by early-onset proteinuria, resistance to immunosuppressive therapy and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease. Compound heterozygous changes involving the podocin variant R229Q combined with another pathogenic mutation have been associated with a mild phenotype with disease onset often in adulthood. We screened 19 families with early-onset SRNS for mutations in NPHS2 and WT1 and identified four disease-causing mutations (three in NPHS2 and one in WT1) prior to planned whole-exome sequencing. We describe two families with three individuals presenting in childhood who are compound heterozygous for R229Q and one other pathogenic NPHS2 mutation, either L327F or A297V. One child presented at age 4 years (A297V plus R229Q) and the other two at age 13 (L327F plus R229Q), one with steadily deteriorating renal function. These cases highlight the phenotypic variability associated with the NPHS2 R229Q variant plus pathogenic mutation. Individuals may present with early aggressive disease.	4
Genetic and chromosomal alterations in Kenyan Wilms Tumor. || Child, Preschool Chromosome Aberrations Cohort Studies Female Gene Dosage Genes, Wilms Tumor High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Kenya Kidney Neoplasms Male Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Wilms Tumor || Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common childhood kidney cancer worldwide and poses a cancer health disparity to black children of sub-Saharan African ancestry. Although overall survival from WT at 5 years exceeds 90% in developed countries, this pediatric cancer is alarmingly lethal in sub-Saharan Africa and specifically in Kenya (36% survival at 2 years). Although multiple barriers to adequate WT therapy contribute to this dismal outcome, we hypothesized that a uniquely aggressive and treatment-resistant biology compromises survival further. To explore the biologic composition of Kenyan WT (KWT), we completed a next generation sequencing analysis targeting 10 WT-associated genes and evaluated whole-genome copy number variation. The study cohort was comprised of 44 KWT patients and their specimens. Fourteen children are confirmed dead at 2 years and 11 remain lost to follow-up despite multiple tracing attempts. TP53 was mutated most commonly in 11 KWT specimens (25%), CTNNB1 in 10 (23%), MYCN in 8 (18%), AMER1 in 5 (11%), WT1 and TOP2A in 4 (9%), and IGF2 in 3 (7%). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 17p, which covers TP53, was detected in 18% of specimens examined. Copy number gain at 1q, a poor prognostic indicator of WT biology in developed countries, was detected in 32% of KWT analyzed, and 89% of these children are deceased. Similarly, LOH at 11q was detected in 32% of KWT, and 80% of these patients are deceased. From this genomic analysis, KWT biology appears uniquely aggressive and treatment-resistant.	4
Frequency of the 35delG allele causing nonsyndromic recessive deafness in the Algerian patients. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Adolescent Adult Algeria Alleles Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Consanguinity Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genotype Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Polymerase Chain Reaction || Deafness is a heterogeneous disorder showing different patterns of inheritance and involving a multitude of different genes. Mutations in the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26) protein are a major cause for non-syndromic autosomal recessive and sporadic deafness. Among these mutations, the c.35delG deletion is the most common mutation for sensorineural deafness. One hundred sixteen persons from fifty-eight families were tested by the method based on the principle of PCR-mediated-site-directed mutagenesis (PSDM), followed by a Bsl1 digestion. Mutation c.35delG was diagnosed in sixteen families (11 homozygotes and 5 heterozygotes). The low allelic frequency (17.24%) and low ratio of individuals homozygous (13.8%) and heterozygous (6.9%) for the c.35delG mutation suggest that there are other mutations in the GJB2 gene or other genes responsible for deafness in the Algerian population. This study reports a significant association (P=0.003) between first cousin consanguinity and non-syndromic prelingual deafness.	4
Genetic loci associated with plasma concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1, and Apolipoprotein B among 6382 white women in genome-wide analysis with replication. || Aged Apolipoprotein A-I Apolipoproteins B Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genetic Loci Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome, Human Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Lipid Metabolism Lipids Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Reproducibility of Results Triglycerides || Genome-wide genetic association analysis represents an opportunity for a comprehensive survey of the genes governing lipid metabolism, potentially revealing new insights or even therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease and related metabolic disorders. We have performed large-scale, genome-wide genetic analysis among 6382 white women with replication in 2 cohorts of 970 additional white men and women for associations between common single-nucleotide polymorphisms and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein(Apo) A1, and ApoB. Genome-wide associations (P < 5 x 10(-8)) were found at the PCSK9 gene, the APOB gene, theLPL gene, the APOA1-APOA5 locus, the LIPC gene, the CETP gene, the LDLR gene, and the APOE locus. In addition,genome-wide associations with triglycerides at the GCKR gene confirm and extend emerging links between glucose and lipid metabolism. Still other genome-wide associations at the 1p13.3 locus are consistent with emerging biological properties for a region of the genome, possibly related to the SORT1 gene. Below genome-wide significance, our study provides confirmatory evidence for associations at 5 novel loci with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides reported recently in separate genome-wide association studies. The total proportion of variance explained by common variation at the genome-wide candidate loci ranges from 4.3% for triglycerides to 12.6% for ApoB. Genome-wide associations at the GCKR gene and near the SORT1 gene, as well as confirmatory associations at 5 additional novel loci, suggest emerging biological pathways for lipid metabolism among white women.	4
CRAF R391W is a melanoma driver oncogene. || Aged Animals Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Mice NIH 3T3 Cells Oncogenes Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf || Approximately 75% of melanomas have known driver oncogenic mutations in BRAF, NRAS, GNA11 or GNAQ, while the mutations providing constitutive oncogenic signaling in the remaining melanomas are not known. We established a melanoma cell line from a tumor with none of the common driver mutations. This cell line demonstrated a signaling profile similar to BRAF-mutants, but lacked sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. RNA-seq mutation data implicated CRAF R391W as the alternative driver mutation of this melanoma. CRAF R391W was homozygous and over expressed. These melanoma cells were highly sensitive to CRAF, but not BRAF knockdown. In reconstitution experiments, CRAF R391W, but not CRAF WT, transformed NIH3T3 cells in soft-agar colony formation assays, increased kinase activity in vitro, induced MAP kinase signaling and conferred vemurafenib resistance. MAP kinase inducing activity was dependent on CRAF dimerization. Thus, CRAF is a bona fide alternative oncogene for BRAF/NRAS/GNAQ/GNA11 wild type melanomas.	0
Non-hodgkin lymphoma in a patient with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. ||  || Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, ectodermal abnormalities, and heart defects. Clinically, it overlaps with both Noonan syndrome and Costello syndrome. Mutations in KRAS, BRAF, and MAP2K1/2 (MEK1/2) have been identified in patients with CFC syndrome. BRAF mutations are involved in more than 80% of CFC syndrome patients, and we have reported earlier that 2 CFC patients with BRAF mutations developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we report a boy with CFC syndrome who developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At 2 months of age, he developed pneumonia with pleurisy and was diagnosed as having non-Hodgkin lymphoma (precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma) by cytopathologic examination of the pleural fluid. He was suspected of having Noonan syndrome because of his facial appearance, webbed neck, and cubitus valgus. Precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was treated by the TCCSG NHL 94-04 protocol. At 9 years of age, he was clinically reevaluated and diagnosed as having CFC syndrome because of his distinctive facial appearance, multiple nevi, and moderate mental retardation. Sequencing analysis showed a germline p.A246P (c.736G>C) mutation in BRAF reported earlier in CFC syndrome. Molecular diagnosis and careful observation should be considered in children with CFC syndrome.	4
SHP2 positively regulates TGFβ1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition modulated by its novel interacting protein Hook1. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Epithelial Cells Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HEK293 Cells Humans Lung Microtubule-Associated Proteins Mutation Protein Binding Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 RNA, Small Interfering Recombinant Proteins Signal Transduction Transforming Growth Factor beta1 || The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential process for embryogenesis. It also plays a critical role in the initiation of tumor metastasis. Src homology 2 (SH2)-domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) is a ubiquitously expressed protein-tyrosine phosphatase and is mutated in many tumors. However, its functional role in tumor metastasis remains largely unknown. We found that TGFβ1-induced EMT in lung epithelial A549 cells was partially blocked when SHP2 was decreased by transfected siRNA. The constitutively active form (E76V) promoted EMT while the phosphatase-dead mutation (C459S) and the SHP2 inhibitor PHPS1 blocked EMT, which further demonstrated that the phosphatase activity of SHP2 was required for promoting TGFβ1-induced EMT. Using the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain of SHP2 as bait, we identified a novel SHP2-interacting protein Hook1. Hook1 was down-regulated during EMT in A549 cells. Overexpression of Hook1 inhibited EMT while knockdown of Hook1 promoted EMT. Moreover, both the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain and N-terminal SH2 domain of SHP2 directly interacted with Hook1. Down-regulation of Hook1 increased SHP2 activity. These results suggested that Hook1 was an endogenous negative regulator of SHP2 phosphatase activity. Our data showed that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 was involved in the process of EMT and Hook1 repressed EMT by regulating the activation of SHP2. SHP2-Hook1 complex may play important roles in tumor metastases by regulating EMT in cancer cells.	0
Rapid molecular genetic diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by semiconductor sequencing. || Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Humans Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Mutation Semiconductors Sequence Analysis, DNA || Rapidly determining the complex genetic basis of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is vital to better understanding and optimally managing this common polygenetic cardiovascular disease. A rapid custom Ion-amplicon-resequencing assay, covering 30 commonly affected genes of HCM, was developed and validated in 120 unrelated patients with HCM to facilitate genetic diagnosis of this disease. With this HCM-specific panel and only 20 ng of input genomic DNA, physicians can, for the first time, go from blood samples to variants within a single day. On average, this approach gained 595628 mapped reads per sample, 95.51% reads on target (64.06 kb), 490-fold base coverage depth and 93.24% uniformity of base coverage in CDS regions of the 30 HCM genes. After validation, we detected underlying pathogenic variants in 87% (104 of 120) samples. Tested seven randomly selected HCM genes in eight samples by Sanger sequencing, the sensitivity and false-positive-rate of this HCM panel was 100% and 5%, respectively. This Ion amplicon HCM resequencing assay provides a currently most rapid, comprehensive, cost-effective and reliable measure for genetic diagnosis of HCM in routinely obtained samples.	4
Molecular Analysis of a Genetic Variants Panel Related to Nutrients and Metabolism: Association with Susceptibility to Gestational Diabetes and Cardiometabolic Risk in Affected Women. || Adult Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO Apolipoprotein A-V Diabetes, Gestational Female Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans PPAR gamma Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Pregnancy Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Receptors, LDL Risk Factors Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein || Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most frequent metabolic disorder in pregnancy. Women with a GDM history are at increased risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Studies have demonstrated a significant correlation between several genes involved in the metabolic pathway of insulin and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical parameters in GDM and variants in genes involved with nutrients and metabolism. Several variants PPARG2 rs1801282 (C>G);PPARGC1A rs8192678 (C>T);TCF7L2 rs7903146 (C>T);LDLR rs2228671 (C>T);MTHFR rs1801133 (C>T);APOA5 rs662799 (T>C);GCKR rs1260326 (C>T);FTO rs9939609 (T>A);MC4R rs17782313 (T>C) were genotyped in 168 pregnant Caucasian women with or without GDM by High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis. A significant correlation was observed between TT genotype ofTCF7L2 gene and increased risk of GDM (OR 5.4 [95% CI 1.5-19.3]). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between lipid parameters and genetic variations in additional genes, namely,PPARG2 [p = 0,02],APOA5 [p = 0,02],MC4R [p = 0,03],LDLR [p = 0,01], andFTO [p = 0,02]. Our findings support the association betweenTCF7L2 rs7903146 variant and an increased GDM risk. Results about the investigated genetic variants provide important information about cardiometabolic risk in GDM and help to plan future prevention studies.	4
Adaptive genetic variation and heart disease risk. || Adaptation, Physiological Diet Dyslipidemias Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Heart Diseases Humans Obesity || Obesity, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease are complex and determined by both genetic and environmental factors and their inter-relationships. Many associations from genome-wide association studies and candidate gene approaches have described a multitude of polymorphisms associating with lipid and obesity phenotypes but identified genetic variants account for only a small fraction of phenotypic variation. That many genotype-phenotype associations involve variants under positive selection and that those variants respond to environmental cues together suggest prominent roles for both genetic adaptation and their interactions with the environment. Adaptive genetic variations interacting with environment modulate disease susceptibility but the level to which those variants contribute to dyslipidemia and obesity and how environmental factors, especially diet, alter the genetic association is not yet completely known. It is evident that genetic variants under positive selection make important contributions to obesity and heart disease risk. Advances in resequencing the entire human genome will enable accurate identification of adaptive variants. Considering interactions between environmental factors and genotypes will empower both genome-wide association studies and characterization of the relationship between positive selection and the obese and dyslipidemic conditions.	4
Co-segregation of elevated LDL with a novel mutation (D92K) of the LDL receptor in a kindred with multiple lipoprotein abnormalities. || Adult Chromosome Segregation Family Health Female Genetic Variation Humans Hyperlipoproteinemias Lipoproteins, LDL Pedigree Point Mutation Receptors, LDL || Factors predisposing to the phenotypic features of familial combined hyperlipidemia have not been clearly defined. In the course of investigating familial coronary artery disease in Utah, we identified a three-generation family in which multiple members were affected with type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP IIa), type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP IIb), or type IV hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP IV). Because several family members had relatively severe low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol elevation, in order to dissect the possible contribution to the plasma lipoprotein abnormalities in this pedigree, we identified a novel point mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene, a G-to-A transition at nucleotide position 337 in exon 4. This change substituted lysine for glutamic acid at codon 92 (D92K) of the LDL receptor. By means of mutant allele-specific amplification we determined that the mutation co-segregated with elevated cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the plasma of family members with HLP IIa and HLP IIb, but not with the elevated plasma triglycerides seen in HLP IIb and HLP IV patients. Thus, in families with apparent familial combined hyperlipidemia, a defective LDLR allele and other genetic or environmental factors that elevate plasma triglycerides may account for the multiple lipid phenotypes observed in this kindred.	4
The p53 Tumor Suppressor in the Control of Metabolism and Ferroptosis. ||  || The p53 tumor suppressor continues to be distinguished as the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. It is widely believed that the ability of p53 to induce senescence and programmed cell death underlies the tumor suppressor functions of p53. However, p53 has a number of other functions that recent data strongly implicate in tumor suppression, particularly with regard to the control of metabolism and ferroptosis (iron- and lipid-peroxide-mediated cell death) by p53. As reviewed here, the roles of p53 in the control of metabolism and ferroptosis are complex. Wild-type (WT) p53 negatively regulates lipid synthesis and glycolysis in normal and tumor cells, and positively regulates oxidative phosphorylation and lipid catabolism. Mutant p53 in tumor cells does the converse, positively regulating lipid synthesis and glycolysis. The role of p53 in ferroptosis is even more complex: in normal tissues, WT p53 appears to positively regulate ferroptosis, and this pathway appears to play a role in the ability of basal, unstressed p53 to suppress tumor initiation and development. In tumors, other regulators of ferroptosis supersede p53's role, and WT p53 appears to play a limited role; instead, mutant p53 sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis. By clearly elucidating the roles of WT and mutant p53 in metabolism and ferroptosis, and establishing these roles in tumor suppression, emerging research promises to yield new therapeutic avenues for cancer and metabolic diseases.	0
A high-throughput protocol for mutation scanning of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. || DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Testing Germ-Line Mutation Heterozygote High-Throughput Screening Assays Humans Polymorphism, Genetic Single-Blind Method || Detection of mutations by DNA sequencing can be facilitated by scanning methods to identify amplicons which may have mutations. Current scanning methods used for the detection of germline sequence variants are laborious as they require post-PCR manipulation. High resolution melting (HRM) is a cost-effective rapid screening strategy, which readily detects heterozygous variants by melting curve analysis of PCR products. It is well suited to screening genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 as germline pathogenic mutations in these genes are always heterozygous. Assays for the analysis of all coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were designed, and optimised. A final set of 94 assays which ran under identical amplification conditions were chosen for BRCA1 (36) and BRCA2 (58). Significant attention was placed on primer design to enable reproducible detection of mutations within the amplicon while minimising unnecessary detection of polymorphisms. Deoxyinosine residues were incorporated into primers that overlay intronic polymorphisms. Multiple 384 well plates were used to facilitate high throughput. 169 BRCA1 and 239 BRCA2 known sequence variants were used to test the amplicons. We also performed an extensive blinded validation of the protocol with 384 separate patient DNAs. All heterozygous variants were detected with the optimised assays. This is the first HRM approach to screen the entire coding region of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes using one set of reaction conditions in a multi plate 384 well format using specifically designed primers. The parallel screening of a relatively large number of samples enables better detection of sequence variants. HRM has the advantages of decreasing the necessary sequencing by more than 90%. This markedly reduced cost of sequencing will result in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing becoming accessible to individuals who currently do not undergo mutation testing because of the significant costs involved.	4
Multiplex genetic cancer testing identifies pathogenic mutations in TP53 and CDH1 in a patient with bilateral breast and endometrial adenocarcinoma. || Adenocarcinoma Antigens, CD Breast Neoplasms Cadherins Endometrial Neoplasms Female Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Germline genetic testing for familial cancer syndromes is usually performed serially for the most likely genetic causes. In recent years the way genetic testing carried out has changed, as next generation sequencing now allows the simultaneous testing of multiple susceptibility genes at low costs. Here, we present a female with bilateral breast cancer and endometrial adenocarcinoma. After simultaneous sequencing of 150 genes (890 kb) associated with hereditary cancer we identified pathogenic mutations in two high-penetrance genes, i.e. TP53 and CDH1 that would most likely not have been elucidated by serial screening of candidate genes. As the two mutated genes are located on different chromosomes and cause different cancer syndromes these findings had a tremendous impact not only on genetic counseling of the index patient and her family but also on subsequent surveillance strategies.	4
Toward Personalized Medicine: Does Genetic Diagnosis of Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Influence Patient Management? ||  || A goal of personalized medicine is to provide increasingly sophisticated, individualized approaches to management and therapy for disease. Genetics is the engine that drives personalized medicine, holding the promise of therapeutics directed toward the unique needs of each patient. The 3rd International Conference on Cardiomyopathy in Children provided a forum to discuss the current status of personalized approaches to diagnosis, management, and therapy in the pediatric cardiomyopathy population. This review will focus on the importance of genetic diagnosis in this population as a necessary first step toward understanding the best approach to management and influencing disease outcome. The genetic heterogeneity of cardiomyopathy in children, the implications of specific genotypes, the ability to risk stratify based on genotype, and the impact on cascade screening in family members will be discussed.	4
Executive Function and Adaptive Behavior in Muenke Syndrome. || Adaptation, Psychological Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Craniosynostoses Cross-Sectional Studies Executive Function Female Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Siblings Young Adult || To investigate executive function and adaptive behavior in individuals with Muenke syndrome using validated instruments with a normative population and unaffected siblings as controls. Participants in this cross-sectional study included individuals with Muenke syndrome (P250R mutation in FGFR3) and their mutation-negative siblings. Participants completed validated assessments of executive functioning (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]) and adaptive behavior skills (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition [ABAS-II]). Forty-four with a positive FGFR3 mutation, median age 9 years, range 7 months to 52 years were enrolled. In addition, 10 unaffected siblings served as controls (5 males, 5 females; median age, 13 years; range, 3-18 years). For the General Executive Composite scale of the BRIEF, 32.1% of the cohort had scores greater than +1.5 SD, signifying potential clinical significance. For the General Adaptive Composite of the ABAS-II, 28.2% of affected individuals scored in the 3rd-8th percentile of the normative population, and 56.4% were below the average category (<25th percentile). Multiple regression analysis did not identify craniosynostosis as a predictor of BRIEF (P = .70) or ABAS-II scores (P = .70). In the sibling pair analysis, affected siblings performed significantly poorer on the BRIEF General Executive Composite and the ABAS-II General Adaptive Composite. Individuals with Muenke syndrome are at an increased risk for developing adaptive and executive function behavioral changes compared with a normative population and unaffected siblings.	4
[Study of generational risk in deafness inflicted couples using deafness gene microarray technique]. ||  || To explored the significance of screening the gene mutations of deafness related in deaf-mute (deaf & dumb) family using DNA microarray. Total of 52 couples of deaf-mute were recruited from Changchun deaf-mute community. With an average age of (58.3 ± 6.7) years old (x(-) ± s). Blood samples were obtained with informed consent. Their genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and PCR was performed. Nine of hot spot mutations in four most common deafness pathologic gene were examined with the DNA microarray, including GJB2, GJB3, PDS and mtDNA 12S rRNA genes. At the same time, the results were verified with the traditional methods of sequencing. Fifty of normal people served as a control group. All patients were diagnosed non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss by subjective pure tone audiometry. Thirty-two of 104 cases appeared GJB2 gene mutation (30.7%), the mutation sites included 35delG, 176del16, 235delC and 299delAT. Eighteen of 32 cases of GJB2 mutations were 235delC (59.1%). Seven of 104 cases appeared SLC26A4 gene IVS7-2 A > G mutation. Questionnaire survey and gene diagnosis revealed that four of 52 families have deaf offspring (7.6%). When a couple carries the same gene mutation, the risk of their children deafness was 100%. The results were confirmed with the traditional methods of sequencing. There is a high risk of deafness if a deaf-mute family is planning to have a new baby. It is very important and helpful to avoid deaf newborns again in deaf-mute family by DNA microarray.	4
Mapping the functional versatility and fragility of Ras GTPase signaling circuits through in vitro network reconstitution. || Feedback, Physiological Humans Protein Interaction Maps Signal Transduction ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors || The Ras-superfamily GTPases are central controllers of cell proliferation and morphology. Ras signaling is mediated by a system of interacting molecules: upstream enzymes (GEF/GAP) regulate Ras's ability to recruit multiple competing downstream effectors. We developed a multiplexed, multi-turnover assay for measuring the dynamic signaling behavior of in vitro reconstituted H-Ras signaling systems. By including both upstream regulators and downstream effectors, we can systematically map how different network configurations shape the dynamic system response. The concentration and identity of both upstream and downstream signaling components strongly impacted the timing, duration, shape, and amplitude of effector outputs. The distorted output of oncogenic alleles of Ras was highly dependent on the balance of positive (GAP) and negative (GEF) regulators in the system. We found that different effectors interpreted the same inputs with distinct output dynamics, enabling a Ras system to encode multiple unique temporal outputs in response to a single input. We also found that different Ras-to-GEF positive feedback mechanisms could reshape output dynamics in distinct ways, such as signal amplification or overshoot minimization. Mapping of the space of output behaviors accessible to Ras provides a design manual for programming Ras circuits, and reveals how these systems are readily adapted to produce an array of dynamic signaling behaviors. Nonetheless, this versatility comes with a trade-off of fragility, as there exist numerous paths to altered signaling behaviors that could cause disease.	0
MYCN acts as a direct co-regulator of p53 in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma. || DNA damage resposone MYCN neuroblastoma p53 p53 C-terminal domain || The MYC oncogenes and p53 have opposing yet interrelated roles in normal development and tumorigenesis. How MYCN expression alters the biology and clinical responsiveness of pediatric neuroblastoma remains poorly defined. Neuroblastoma is p53 wild type at diagnosis and repression of p53 signaling is required for tumorigenesis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that MYCN amplification alters p53 transcriptional activity in neuroblastoma. Interestingly, we found that MYCN directly binds to the tetrameric form of p53 at its C-terminal domain, and this interaction is independent of MYCN/MAX heterodimer formation. Chromatin analysis of MYCN and p53 targets reveals dramatic changes in binding, as well as co-localization of the MYCN-p53 complex at p53-REs and E-boxes of genes critical to DNA damage responses and cell cycle progression. RNA sequencing studies show that MYCN-p53 co-localization significantly modulated the expression of p53 target genes. Furthermore, MYCN-p53 interaction leads to regulation of alternative p53 targets not regulated in the presence of low MYCN levels. These novel targets include a number of genes involved in lipid metabolism, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel oncogenic role of MYCN as a transcriptional co-regulator of p53 in high-risk MYCN amplified neuroblastoma. Targeting this novel oncogenic function of MYCN may enhance p53-mediated responses and sensitize MYCN amplified tumors to chemotherapy.	0
RAS Proteins and Their Regulators in Human Disease. || Animals Cell Membrane Congenital Abnormalities Humans Mental Disorders Mutation Neoplasms Phylogeny Signal Transduction Yeasts ras Proteins || RAS proteins are binary switches, cycling between ON and OFF states during signal transduction. These switches are normally tightly controlled, but in RAS-related diseases, such as cancer, RASopathies, and many psychiatric disorders, mutations in the RAS genes or their regulators render RAS proteins persistently active. The structural basis of the switch and many of the pathways that RAS controls are well known, but the precise mechanisms by which RAS proteins function are less clear. All RAS biology occurs in membranes: a precise understanding of RAS' interaction with membranes is essential to understand RAS action and to intervene in RAS-driven diseases.	0
Reliable Detection of Somatic Mutations in Fine Needle Aspirates of Pancreatic Cancer With Next-generation Sequencing: Implications for Surgical Management. || Base Sequence Biopsy, Fine-Needle DNA, Neoplasm Genotyping Techniques Humans Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms Reproducibility of Results || To determine the feasibility of genotyping pancreatic tumors via fine needle aspirates (FNAs). FNA is a common method of diagnosis for pancreatic cancer, yet it has traditionally been considered inadequate for molecular studies due to the limited quantity of DNA derived from FNA specimens and tumor heterogeneity. In vitro mixing studies were performed to deduce the minimum cellularity needed for genetic analysis. DNA from both simulated FNAs and clinical FNAs was sequenced. Mutational concordance was determined between simulated FNAs and that of the resected specimen. Limiting dilution studies indicated that mutations present at allele frequencies as low as 0.12% are detectable. Comparison of simulated FNAs and matched tumor tissue exhibited a concordance frequency of 100% for all driver genes present. In FNAs obtained from 17 patients with unresectable disease, we identified at least 1 driver gene mutation in all patients including actionable somatic mutations in ATM and MTOR. The constellation of mutations identified in these patients was different than that reported for resectable pancreatic cancers, implying a biologic basis for presentation with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. FNA sequencing is feasible and subsets of patients may harbor actionable mutations that could potentially impact therapy. Moreover, preoperative FNA sequencing has the potential to influence the timing of surgery relative to systemic therapy. FNA sequencing opens the door to clinical trials in which patients undergo neoadjuvant or a surgery-first approach based on their tumor genetics with the goal of utilizing cancer genomics in the clinical management of pancreatic cancer.	4
[Mutations in exon 7 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in chinese patients with phenylketonuria]. || Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Child China DNA Exons Female Frameshift Mutation Humans Male Mutation Mutation, Missense Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Sequence Analysis, DNA Sequence Deletion || To study mutation in exon 7 of the gene for the phenylalanine hydroxylase(PAH), the mutations in exon 7 and flanking sequence of PAH gene were detected by means of SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing, in 147 unrelated Chinese children with phynelketonuria and their parents. Thirteen different mutations, including 11 missense, 1 deletion and 1 splice mutation, were revealed in 90/294 mutant alleles (30.61%). The prevalent mutations were R243Q (22.8%) and Ivs7nt2t->a (2.38%). Seven novel mutations were identified: G239D, R241fsdelG, G247S, E280G, L255S, R261Q, P281L. These new mutations have not been described in Chinese PKU population and the first 4 mutants have not been reported and thus been submitted to www.pahdb,mcgill.ca. The missense was the most common type. The deletion and frameshift mutations were detected for the first time in Chinese PKU population. This study showed the mutation characteristics and their distribution in exon 7 of PAH gene and proved that the exon 7 was the hot region of PAH gene mutation in Chinese PKU population .	3
High-throughput screening for GJB2 mutations--its clinical application to genetic testing in prelingual deafness screening for GJB2 mutations. || Chromosome Deletion Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Exons Female Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Testing Homozygote Humans Infant Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Reproducibility of Results || Mutations in connexin26 (GJB2) are one of the most frequent causes of prelingual hearing impairment. Several different types of one-base deletions in exon2 were the most common type of GJB2 mutation regardless of ethnicity, including 35delG in American-European populations, 235delC in Japanese population and 167delT in Ashkenazi Jewish population. Various types of one-base substitutions were also considered to be causative mutations of GJB2 associated hearing impairment. This article describes a rapid and high-throughput screening procedure for the detection of one-base deletion/substitution in GJB2 with less invasive sampling procedure in the implication for the clinical application. 53 hearing-impaired children and 50 healthy controls were admitted to take part in this study program. DNA samples obtained from buccal swab were used to amplify the exon2 of GJB2, and single run with an automated sequencer was used to identify the one-base deletion. Single-base substitutions were also screened by primer-extension procedure with dye terminators. The presence of both types of mutations was confirmed by direct sequence of the GJB2 exon2. Two of 50 controls (4%) included one-base deletion in GJB2 as heterozygote. 14 of 53 hearing impaired cases (26.4%) contained deletion in GJB2 either as homozygote (five cases) or heterozygote (nine cases) form. Sequencing analysis of whole exon2 of GJB2 identified all these deletions as 235delC. Primer-extension analysis revealed additional mutations with single base substitutions in three cases with compound heterozygote with 235delC. Rapid screening procedure of GJB2 can be potentially useful for the identification of prelingual deafness.	4
Mutant p53 tunes the NRF2-dependent antioxidant response to support survival of cancer cells. ||  || NRF2 (NFE2L2) is one of the main regulators of the antioxidant response of the cell. Here we show that in cancer cells NRF2 targets are selectively upregulated or repressed through a mutant p53-dependent mechanism. Mechanistically, mutant p53 interacts with NRF2, increases its nuclear presence and resides with NRF2 on selected ARE containing gene promoters activating the transcription of a specific set of genes while leading to the transcriptional repression of others. We show that thioredoxin (TXN) is a mutant p53-activated NRF2 target with pro-survival and pro-migratory functions in breast cancer cells under oxidative stress, while heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) is a mutant p53-repressed target displaying opposite effects. A gene signature of NRF2 targets activated by mutant p53 shows a significant association with bad overall prognosis and with mutant p53 status in breast cancer patients. Concomitant inhibition of thioredoxin system with Auranofin and of mutant p53 with APR-246 synergizes in killing cancer cells expressing p53 gain-of-function mutants.	0
Determination of a positive malignant hyperthermia (MH) disposition without the in vitro contracture test in families carrying the RYR1 Arg614Cys mutation. || Caffeine DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Family Health Female Halothane Humans Male Malignant Hyperthermia Muscle Contraction Muscle, Skeletal Mutation, Missense Pedigree Phenotype Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel || Molecular genetic methods are used with caution for determining positive malignant hyperthermia (MH) disposition in clinical MH diagnosis because of the genetic variability of this disease. But under defined conditions, genotyping can have an advantage over the standardized in vitro contracture test (IVCT) in respect of invasive approach, specificity, patient compliance, and the work and expense involved in the method. We aim to demonstrate this using 10 families with the Arg614Cys mutation in the ryanodine receptor as an example. Fifty-one index patients who had been classified as MH-susceptible (MHS) in the IVCT (European MH protocol) after a clinical MH incident or suspected MH were screened for the Arg614Cys (C1840-->T) mutation in the RYR1 gene because this mutation is more common in German MH families (9%). The family members of those index patients, in whom a Arg614Cys mutation was detectable, were also screened for the presence of this mutation (n=136), and the results were subjected to a more detailed analysis including existing IVCT findings (n=71). The Arg614Cys mutation was identified in a total of 64 members of the 10 independent families. In 35 individuals in this group, there was a definite concordance between the MHS diagnosis in the IVCT and the presence of the Arg614Cys mutation. No individual phenotyped as MH-negative carried the mutation. On the basis of the guidelines of the EMHG for molecular genetic detection of MH susceptibility, 29 individuals who bore the Arg614Cys mutation were classified as MHS without the IVCT. If a causal mutation is detected in an MH family, the MHS diagnosis can be deduced without the invasive IVCT in all other mutation carriers. Despite inclusion of only one (Arg614Cys) of all known MH mutations, the study emphasizes the practical use of a genetic approach for determination of a positive MH diagnosis.	4
WTH3 is a direct target of the p53 protein. || Apoptosis Binding Sites Cell Cycle Drug Resistance, Multiple Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HeLa Cells Humans Response Elements Transfection Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 rab GTP-Binding Proteins || Previous results showed that overexpression of the WTH3 gene in multidrug resistance (MDR) cells reduced MDR1 gene expression and converted their resistance to sensitivity to various anticancer drugs. The WTH3 gene promoter was found to be differentially regulated in paired MDR vs non-MDR MCF7 cells owing to epigenetic modifications and transcription factor modulations. To understand further the mechanisms that govern WTH3's differential expression, we uncovered a p53-binding site in its promoter, which indicated that WTH3 could be regulated by the p53 gene. This hypothesis was then tested by different strategies. The resulting data revealed that (1) the WTH3 promoter was upregulated by the p53 transgene in diverse host cells; (2) there was a correlation between WTH3 expression levels and p53 gene status in a cell line panel; (3) a WTH3 promoter region was directly targeted by the p53 protein in vitro and in vivo. In addition, overexpression of the WTH3 gene promoted the apoptotic phenotype in host cells. On the basis of these findings, we believe that the negative role played by the WTH3 gene in MDR development is through its proapoptotic potential that is regulated by multiple mechanisms at the transcription level, and one of these mechanisms is linked to the p53 gene.	0
Mutational Profile of Metastatic Breast Cancer Tissue in Patients Treated with Exemestane Plus Everolimus. || Aged Androstadienes Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Everolimus Female Genes, Neoplasm Humans Middle Aged Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Prospective Studies Retrospective Studies Sirolimus || Everolimus has been shown to overcome endocrine resistance in hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer patients. Predictive biomarkers of everolimus efficacy have been investigated in primary breast cancer tissue without finding univocal results. The goal of this study was to investigate the mutational burden in the metastatic site of endocrine-resistant tumors treated with everolimus plus exemestane. Mass Array Sequenom platform was used to analyse genetic status of 18 cancer-related genes in 25 archival tumor specimens from metastatic lesions and available primary matched breast cancer tissue of patients treated with everolimus and exemestane for advanced disease. An exploratory analysis of everolimus efficacy in terms of progression free survival benefit and single gene mutation was carried out. The overall detection rate of mutation was 30% and 38% from metastatic and primary breast cancer samples, respectively. AKT1E17K was the most frequent mutated gene. No primary breast cancer and matched relapse maintained the same mutation profile. Considering molecular pathways, the most of the genes belong to PI3K pathway (AKT1E17K, PI3KCAE545K, and KITG565R,S709F). In patients with detected mutations in breast and/or recurrence tissue the median PFS was 5,6 months while in the subgroup of patients with no mutations the median PFS was 7,5 months. The mutational status of breast cancer recurrence allows the identification of some genes potentially correlating tumor response/resistance to everolimus. The most frequently mutated genes were involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway highlighting that the deregulation of this pathway in the relapse plays a crucial role in the mechanisms of everolimus resistance/sensitivity. Owing to the small sample size and the retrospective nature of the study, these correlations need to be validated in a large prospective study.	4
Genetic heterogeneity and actionable mutations in HER2-positive primary breast cancers and their brain metastases. ||  || Brain metastases constitute a challenge in the management of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 systemic therapies. Here we sought to define the repertoire of mutations private to or enriched for in HER2-positive brain metastases. Massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 254 genes frequently mutated in breast cancers and/or related to DNA repair was used to characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancers and their brain metastases in six patients. Data were analyzed with state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms and selected mutations were validated with orthogonal methods. Spatial and temporal inter-lesion genetic heterogeneity was observed in the HER2-positive brain metastases from an index patient subjected to a rapid autopsy. Genetic alterations restricted to the brain metastases included mutations in cancer genes FGFR2, PIK3CA andATR, homozygous deletion inCDKN2A and amplification inKRAS. Shifts in clonal composition and the acquisition of additional mutations in the progression from primary HER2-positive breast cancer to brain metastases following anti-HER2 therapy were investigated in additional five patients. Likely pathogenic mutations private to or enriched in the brain lesions affected cancer and clinically actionable genes, includingATR, BRAF, FGFR2, MAP2K4, PIK3CA, RAF1 andTP53. Changes in clonal composition and the acquisition of additional mutations in brain metastases may affect potentially actionable genes in HER2-positive breast cancers. Our observations have potential clinical implications, given that treatment decisions for patients with brain metastatic disease are still mainly based on biomarkers assessed in the primary tumor.	4
CHK1 regulates NF-κB signaling upon DNA damage in p53- deficient cells and associated tumor-derived microvesicles. || Animals Caspase 2 Cell Line, Tumor Cell-Derived Microparticles Checkpoint Kinase 1 Cysteine Endopeptidases DNA Damage DNA Repair Doxorubicin Enzyme Activation HCT116 Cells Humans M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints MCF-7 Cells Mice NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha NF-kappa B RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The recently discovered CHK1-Suppressed (CS) pathway is activated by inhibition or loss of the checkpoint kinase CHK1, promoting an apoptotic response to DNA damage mediated by caspase-2 in p53-deficient cells. Although functions of the CS-pathway have been investigated biochemically, it remains unclear whether and how CHK1 inhibition can be regulated endogenously and whether this constitutes a key component of the DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we present data that define the first endogenous activation of the CS-pathway whereby, upon DNA damage, wild type p53 acts as an endogenous regulator of CHK1 levels that modulates caspase-2 activation. Moreover, we demonstrate that persistence of CHK1 levels in response to DNA damage in p53-deficient cancer cells, leads to CHK1-mediated activation of NF-κB and induction of NF-κB-regulated genes in cells and in associated tumor-derived microvesicles (TMVs), both of which are abrogated by loss or inhibition of CHK1. These data define a novel role for CHK1 in the DDR pathway as a regulator NF-κB activity. Our data provide evidence that targeting CHK1 in p53-deficient cancers may abrogate NF-κB signaling that is associated with increased cellular survival and chemoresistance.	0
Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 protects against reactive oxygen species during glucose starvation: Role in the regulation of p53 stability. || Acetylcysteine Apoptosis Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase Blotting, Western CRISPR-Cas Systems Cell Proliferation Gene Knockout Techniques Glucose HT29 Cells HeLa Cells Humans Isoenzymes RNA, Small Interfering Reactive Oxygen Species Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) has been associated with cancer cell growth and invasion, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. NAT1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p21), a region that is commonly deleted in colon cancer. Previously, it was reported that HT-29 colon cancer cells, which have a large deletion at 8p21-22, show marked morphological changes, increased E-cadherin expression and altered cell-cell contact inhibition following down-regulation of NAT1 with shRNA. By contrast, no effects on growth were observed in HeLa cells. In the present study, cellular changes following knockout of NAT1 with CRISPR/Cas9 in HT-29 and HeLa cells were compared in the presence and absence of glucose. Cell growth decreased in both cell-lines during glucose starvation, but it was enhanced in HT-29 cells following NAT1 deletion. This was due to an increase in ROS production that induced cell apoptosis. Both ROS production and cell death were prevented by the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine. NAT1 knockout also resulted in a loss of the gain-of-function p53 protein in HT-29 cells. When p53 expression was inhibited with siRNA in parental HT-29 cells, ROS production and apoptosis increased to levels seen in the NAT1 knockout cells. The loss of p53 may explain the decreased colony formation and increased contact inhibition previously reported following NAT1 down-regulation in these cells. In conclusion, NAT1 is important in maintaining intracellular ROS, especially during glucose starvation, by stabilizing gain-of-function p53 in HT-29 cells. These results suggest that NAT1 may be a novel target to decrease intracellular gain-of -function p53.	0
Microglandular adenosis associated with triple-negative breast cancer is a neoplastic lesion of triple-negative phenotype harbouring TP53 somatic mutations. || Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma Carcinoma in Situ DNA Mutational Analysis Disease Progression Female Fibrocystic Breast Disease Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Immunohistochemistry Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Precancerous Conditions Retrospective Studies Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Microglandular adenosis (MGA) is a rare proliferative lesion of the breast composed of small glands lacking myoepithelial cells and lined by S100-positive, oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and HER2-negative epithelial cells. There is evidence to suggest that MGA may constitute a non-obligate precursor of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We sought to define the genomic landscape of pure MGA and of MGA, atypical MGA (AMGA) and associated TNBCs, and to determine whether synchronous MGA, AMGA, and TNBCs would be clonally related. Two pure MGAs and eight cases of MGA and/or AMGA associated with in situ or invasive TNBC were collected, microdissected, and subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all coding regions of 236 genes recurrently mutated in breast cancer or related to DNA repair. Pure MGAs lacked clonal non-synonymous somatic mutations and displayed limited copy number alterations (CNAs); conversely, all MGAs (n = 7) and AMGAs (n = 3) associated with TNBC harboured at least one somatic non-synonymous mutation (range 3-14 and 1-10, respectively). In all cases where TNBCs were analyzed, identical TP53 mutations and similar patterns of gene CNAs were found in the MGA and/or AMGA and in the associated TNBC. In the MGA/AMGA associated with TNBC lacking TP53 mutations, somatic mutations affecting PI3K pathway-related genes (eg PTEN, PIK3CA, and INPP4B) and tyrosine kinase receptor signalling-related genes (eg ERBB3 and FGFR2) were identified. At diagnosis, MGAs associated with TNBC were found to display subclonal populations, and clonal shifts in the progression from MGA to AMGA and/or to TNBC were observed. Our results demonstrate the heterogeneity of MGAs, and that MGAs associated with TNBC, but not necessarily pure MGAs, are genetically advanced, clonal, and neoplastic lesions harbouring recurrent mutations in TP53 and/or other cancer genes, supporting the notion that a subset of MGAs and AMGAs may constitute non-obligate precursors of TNBCs.	4
Clinical application of targeted next-generation sequencing for colorectal cancer patients: a multicentric Belgian experience. || colorectal cancer next-generation sequencing || International guidelines made RAS (KRAS and NRAS) status a prerequisite for the use of anti-EGFR agents for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Daily, new data emerges on the theranostic and prognostic role of molecular biomarkers; this is a strong incentive for a validated, sensitive, and broadly available molecular screening test. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has begun to supplant other technologies for genomic profiling. We report here our 2 years of clinical practice using NGS results to guide therapeutic decisions. The Ion Torrent AmpliSeq colon/lung cancer panel, which allows mutation detection in 22 cancer-related genes, was prospectively used in clinical practice (BELAC ISO 15189 accredited method). The DNA of 741 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRC tissues, including primary tumors and metastasis, was obtained from 14 different Belgian institutions and subjected to targeted NGS. Of the tumors tested, 98% (727) were successfully sequenced and 89% (650) harbored at least one mutation. KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutations were found in 335 (46%), 78 (11%) and 32 (4%) samples, respectively. These mutation frequencies were consistent with those reported in public databases. Moreover, mutations and amplifications in potentially actionable genes were identified in 464 samples (64%), including mutations in PIK3CA (14%), ERBB2 (0.4%), AKT1 (0.6%), and MAP2K1 (0.1%), as well as amplifications of ERBB2 (0.3%) and EGFR (0.3%). The median turnaround time between reception of the sample in the laboratory and report release was 8 calendar days. Overall, the AmpliSeq colon/lung cancer panel was successfully applied in daily practice and provided reliable clinically relevant information for CRC patients.	4
The Relationship between the p.V37I Mutation in GJB2 and Hearing Phenotypes in Chinese Individuals. || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexins Female Hearing Loss Homozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || The most common cause of nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss is mutations in GJB2. The mutation spectrum and prevalence of mutations vary significantly among ethnic groups, and the relationship between p.V37I mutation in GJB2 and the hearing phenotype is controversial. Among the 3,864 patients in this study, 106 (2.74%) had a homozygous p.V37I variation or a compound p.V37I plus other GJB2 pathogenic mutation, a frequency that was significantly higher than that in the control group (600 individuals, 0%). The hearing loss phenotype ranged from mild to profound in all patients with the homozygous p.V37I variation or compound p.V37I plus other GJB2 pathogenic mutation. There was no difference in the distribution of the hearing level in the group with the homozygous p.V37I variation and the group with the compound p.V37I variation plus pathogenic mutation. Most patients (66.04%) with the V37I-homozygous variation or p.V37I plus other pathogenic mutation had a mild or moderate hearing level. This study found a definite relationship between p.V37I and deafness, and most patients who carried the pathogenic combination with p.V37I mutation had mild or moderate hearing loss. Therefore, otolaryngologists should consider that the milder phenotype might be caused by the GJB2 p.V37I mutation.	4
Low Prevalence of TERT Promoter, BRAF and RAS Mutations in Papillary Thyroid Cancer in the Greek Population. ||  || Thyroid cancer is a common endocrine malignancy and displays a variety of histological patterns ranging from adenoma to malignant tumors. Molecular diagnostics have given significant insights into the genetic basis of thyroid tumorigenesis, known to be linked with signaling pathways affected by oxidative stress. We report for the first time a genotype study of TERT promoter combined with BRAF and RAS mutations in Papillary Thyroid Cancer (PTC) cases in the Greek population. Polymerase Chain Reaction and sequencing were used to identify TERT promoter (C228T, C250T, CC243-243TT) mutations, the BRAF (T1799A) mutation and mutations in codons 12, 13, 61 of the HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes. The most common C228T TERT promoter mutation was identified in 2 PTC cases co-existing with the BRAF mutation. The BRAF T1799A mutation was detected in 10 PTC cases, while two different NRAS mutations in codon 61 (C181A and A182G) were found in 2 PTC cases. These mutations occur in a mutually exclusive manner. Our results indicate that despite the low frequencies, the study of the specific mutations should be encouraged because they are indicative of aggressive forms of thyroid cancer of the papillary histotype in this patient cohort, thus providing insights towards their therapeutic management.	4
Prognostic significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in melanoma: a German study from routine care. || Adult Aged Antineoplastic Agents Disease Progression Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Sequence Analysis, DNA Skin Neoplasms Survival Analysis || Hotspot mutations of the oncogenes BRAF and NRAS are the most common genetic alterations in cutaneous melanoma. Specific inhibitors of BRAF and MEK have shown significant survival benefits in large phase III trials. However, the prognostic significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations outside of clinical trials remains unclear. The mutational status of BRAF (exon 15) and NRAS (exon 2 and 3) was determined in melanoma samples of 217 patients with pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing. The genotypes were correlated with clinical outcomes and pathologic features of the primary tumors. Time to disease progression was calculated with the cumulative incidence function. Survival analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Relative survival was calculated with the Ederer-II method. Treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) was allowed. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS were identified in 40.1 and 24.4% of cases, respectively. Concurrent mutations in both genes were detected in further 2.3%. The remaining 33.2% were wild type for the investigated exons (WT). BRAF mutations were significantly associated with younger age at first diagnosis (p < 0.001) and truncal localization of the culprit primary (p = 0.002). The nodular subtype was most common in the NRAS cohort. In addition, NRAS-mutant melanoma patients showed a higher frequency of nodal relapse (p = 0.013) and development of metastatic disease (p = 0.021). The time to loco-regional nodal relapse was shortest in NRAS-mutant melanoma (p = 0.002). Presence of NRAS mutation was an independent risk factor for disease progression in multivariate analysis (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.02 - 3.98). BRAF-mutant melanoma patients showed a tendency for better overall and relative survival. Genotype was not a consistent risk factor in multivariate analysis. Instead, positive sentinel lymph node status (HR 2.65; 95% CI 1.15 - 6.10) and treatment with ICB in stage IV disease (HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06-0.48) were significant multivariate risk factors. NRAS-mutant tumors tended to behave more aggressively particularly in early stages of the disease in this high-risk melanoma population. Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade improved survival in stage IV disease in a real-world setting.	4
Genetic Variation of SCN5A in Korean Patients with Sick Sinus Syndrome. ||  || Due to recent studies that have shown an association between the genetic variation of SCN5A and sick sinus syndrome (SSS), we sought to determine if a similar correlation existed in Korean patients with SSS. We enrolled 30 patients with SSS who showed a sinus pause (longer than 3.0 s) in Holter monitoring, in addition to 80 controls. All exons including the putative splicing sites of the SCN5A gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced either directly or following subcloning. Wild-type and single nucleotide polymorphisms were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and the peak sodium current (INa ) was analyzed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. A total of 9 genetic variations were identified: 7 variations (G87A-A29A, IVS9-3C>A, A1673G-H558R, G3823A-D1275N, T5457C-D1819D, T5963G-L1988R, and C5129T-S1710L) had been previously reported, and 2 variants (A3075T-E1025D and T4847A-F1616Y) were novel; the potential structural effects of F1616Y were analyzed in a three-dimensional model of the SCN5A domain. Patch-clamp studies at room temperature demonstrated that the peak INa was significantly increased by 140% in HEK cells transfected with F1616Y compared with wild-type (-335.13 pA/pF±24.04, n=8 vs. -139.95 pA/pF±23.76, n=7, respectively). Furthermore, the voltage dependency of the activation and steady-state inactivation of F1616Y were leftward-shifted compared with wild-type (Vh activation=-55.36 mv±0.22, n=8 vs. Vh activation=-44.21 mV±0.17, n=7; respectively; Vh inactivation=-104.47 mV±0.21, n=7 vs. Vh inactivation=-84.89 mV±0.09, n=12, respectively). F1616Y may be associated with SSS.	0
CRAF inhibition induces apoptosis in melanoma cells with non-V600E BRAF mutations. || Apoptosis Benzenesulfonates Cell Line, Tumor Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Knockdown Techniques Glutamic Acid Humans Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mutation Niacinamide Phenylurea Compounds Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Pyridines RNA, Small Interfering Signal Transduction Sorafenib Valine || Here, we identify a panel of melanoma lines with non-V600E mutations in BRAF. These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation. In summary, we have identified a group of melanomas with low-activity BRAF mutations that are reliant upon CRAF-mediated survival activity.	0
Exploring the effect of N308D mutation on protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 cause gain-of-function activity by a molecular dynamics study. ||  || One of the most common protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) mutations in Noonan syndrome is the N308D mutation, and it increases the activity of the protein. However, the molecular basis of the activation of N308D mutation on SHP2 conformations is poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamic simulations were performed on SHP2 and SHP2-N308D to explore the effect of N308D mutation on SHP2 cause gain of function activity, respectively. The principal component analysis, dynamic cross-correlation map, secondary structure analysis, residue interaction networks, and solvent accessible surface area analysis suggested that the N308D mutation distorted the residues interactions network between the allosteric site (residue Gly244-Gly246) and C-SH2 domain, including the hydrogen bond formation and the binding energy. Meanwhile, the activity of catalytic site (residue Gly503-Val505) located in the Q-loop in mutant increased due to this region's high fluctuations. Therefore, the substrate had more chances to access to the catalytic activity site of the precision time protocol domain of SHP2-N308D, which was easy to be exposed. In addition, we had speculated that the Lys244 located in the allosteric site was the key residue which lead to the protein conformation changes. Consequently, overall calculations presented in this study ultimately provide a useful understanding of the increased activity of SHP2 caused by the N308D mutation.	0
Molecular confirmation of HRAS p.G12S in siblings with Costello syndrome. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adult Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Costello Syndrome DNA Mutational Analysis Facies Female Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Mosaicism Pedigree Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Conformation Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Siblings || Costello syndrome was first reported based on its characteristic phenotype. Its presentation affects multiple organ systems, including severe failure-to-thrive with macrocephaly, characteristic facial features, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, papillomata, malignant tumors, and cognitive impairment. Heterozygous germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS have been recognized to cause Costello syndrome, and its inheritance pattern would thus be autosomal dominant. Here, we report on the identification of an HRAS mutation c.34G>A, predicting a p.G12S amino acid substitution, in the surviving brother of a previously reported sibling pair, and documentation of the same change in autopsy material from his deceased sister. This represents, to our knowledge, the first molecularly confirmed Costello syndrome in siblings. We did not detect the mutation in a heterozygous state or mosaicism in peripheral white blood cell or cheek swab-derived DNA samples from either parent. Using single nucleotide polymorphic markers and allele-specific amplification, we clearly identified the mutation in the surviving sibling to be of maternal origin. While we cannot exclude two independently occurring de novo mutations, the complete sharing of polymorphic markers around the mutation site in both siblings supports maternal germ cell mosaicism. Recurrence risk counseling for families with apparently de novo occurring autosomal dominant conditions includes discussion of germ cell mosaicism, and this report underscores the applicability of this concern to Costello syndrome.	4
TP53 Mutational Status and ROS Effect the Expression of the Survivin-Associated Radio-Adaptive Response. || Acetylcysteine Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation Gene Expression Regulation Genomics HCT116 Cells Humans Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins Mutation Radiation Tolerance Reactive Oxygen Species Survivin Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || A survivin-associated radio-adaptive response, characterized by increased radiation resistance or sensitization, was induced by exposure to 5 mGy of ionizing radiation and was correlated to the TP53 mutational status of exposed cells. Ten human cancer lines were investigated: colorectal carcinomas HCT116 and RKO [TP53 wild-type (WT)] and their respective TP53 null isogenic lines; breast adenocarcinomas MCF7 (TP53 WT) and MDA-MB-231 (TP53 Mut); lung carcinomas A549 (TP53 WT) and NCI-H1975 (TP53 Mut); and pancreatic carcinomas Hs766T (TP53 WT) and Panc-1 (TP53 Mut). Radiation induced (5 mGy) changes in the subsequent responses to 2 Gy in a multi-dose paradigm. Effects on radiation sensitivity were associated with changes in survivin's intracellular translocation to the cytoplasm (TP53 WT) or nucleus (TP53 Mut). Survival responses were determined using a colony forming assay. Intracellular localization of survivin was determined by ELISA and correlated with survival response. Two 2 Gy doses had minimal effects on the intracellular translocation of survivin. When preceded 15 min earlier by a 5 mGy exposure, survivin translocated to the cytoplasm in all of the TP53 WT cell lines, and to the nuclei in the TP53 null and Mut cells. All TP53 WT cells were protected (P < 0.001) by 5 mGy exposures, while Mut cells were sensitized (P < 0.001). HCT116 and RKO TP53 WT cells were admixed with their respective isogenic TP53 null counterparts in different proportions: 75% to 25%, 50% to 50% and 25% to 75%, respectively. All mixed confluent cultures expressed enhanced radio-sensitization (P ≤ 0.047) characteristic of TP53 Mut cells, which could be inhibited by their exposure to the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) indicating a role for intercellular signaling by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS signaling in propagating the survivin-mediated response is involved in both intra- and intercellular communication processes.	0
Phenotypic spectrum of Costello syndrome individuals harboring the rare HRAS mutation p.Gly13Asp. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Substitution Amino Acids Child Child, Preschool Costello Syndrome Female Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Mosaicism Neoplasms Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Costello syndrome is part of the RASopathies, a group of neurocardiofaciocutaneous syndromes caused by deregulation of the RAS mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Heterozygous mutations in HRAS are responsible for Costello syndrome, with more than 80% of the patients harboring the specific p.Gly12Ser variant. These individuals show a homogeneous phenotype. The clinical characteristics of the Costello syndrome individuals harboring rarer HRAS mutations are less understood, due to the small number of reported cases. Here, we describe the phenotypic spectrum of five additional individuals with HRAS c.38G>A; p.Gly13Asp, including one with somatic mosaicism, and review five previously described cases. The facial and hair abnormalities of the HRAS p.Gly13Asp individuals differ from the typical pattern observed in those showing the common HRAS (p.Gly12Ser) mutation, with less coarse facial features and slow growing, sparse hair with abnormal texture, the latter resembling the pattern observed in Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair and individuals harboring another amino acid substitution in HRAS (p.Gly13Cys). Although some individuals with HRAS p.Gly13Asp developed papillomata and vascular proliferation lesions, no malignant tumors occurred, similar to what was reported for individuals harboring the HRAS p.Gly13Cys. The fact that no malignant tumors were described in these individuals does not allow definitive conclusions about the risk for cancer development. It remains to be determined if substitutions of amino acid 13 in HRAS (p.Gly13Asp and p.Gly13Cys) increase the risk of tumor development.	4
Cardiac glycosides inhibit p53 synthesis by a mechanism relieved by Src or MAPK inhibition. || Cardiac Glycosides Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Down-Regulation Drug Evaluation, Preclinical Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells HT29 Cells Humans Lung Neoplasms Models, Biological Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src) Transfection Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is regulated at multiple levels. We report here that p53, in multiple lines of human cancer cells, is down-regulated by cardiac glycoside drugs digoxin and ouabain, potent inhibitors of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase. These drugs reduced the basal levels of p53 protein at nanomolar concentrations in a dose-, time-, and cancer cell line-dependent manner, but independent of p53 status of wild-type or mutant. The drugs also reduced the levels of p53 induced by its activators as well as p53 transfected into human cancer cells, regardless of its status. Interestingly, the drugs had no effect on endogenous p53 in two immortalized human cell lines. Mechanistically, p53 reduction occurred not at the mRNA levels but at the protein levels, as a result of reduced protein synthesis rather than enhanced degradation. The cellular sensitivity to drug-induced p53 reduction was not associated with the levels of alphasubunits of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in different cell lines. Although lowering extracellular K(+) did not reduce p53 as did ouabain and digoxin, it did potentiate both digoxin- and ouabain-induced p53 reduction in sensitive lines. Finally, p53 reduction seems to be triggered by activation of Src/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways upon drug binding to the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and can be completely blocked by the inhibitors of Src or MAP/ERK kinase. This is the first report that cardiac glycoside drugs, by initiating the Src/MAPK signaling pathways, reduce the p53 levels via inhibition of p53 protein synthesis. The drugs may be useful in the treatment of human cancers with a gain-of-function p53 mutation.	0

Evidence for origin, by recurrent mutation, of the phenylalanine hydroxylase R408W mutation on two haplotypes in European and Quebec populations. || Alleles Base Sequence DNA Europe Genetics, Population Haplotypes Humans Minisatellite Repeats Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Oligodeoxyribonucleotides Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Quebec Recombination, Genetic || The R408W mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) of phenylketonuria patients occurs on haplotypes 2.3 and 1.8 in Europeans. The mutation involves a CpG dinucleotide; nonetheless, a single recombination event might also explain the two haplotype associations. By analysis of an STR in the PAH gene 5' to the 408 codon and of the VNTR system in the 3' UTR, we identified unique features of the haplotype 1.8 chromosome harbouring the R408W mutation which are not accounted for by recombination. We conclude that recurrent mutation is the origin of R408W on different PAH haplotypes in Europeans.	3
FGFR3, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA mutations in bladder cancer and their potential as biomarkers for surveillance and therapy. || Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Mutation Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Population Surveillance Prognosis Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Urinary Bladder Neoplasms ras Proteins || Fifty percent of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MI-BC) die from their disease and current chemotherapy treatment only marginally increases survival. Novel therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases or activated oncogenes may improve outcome. Hence, it is necessary to stratify patients based on mutations in relevant oncogenes. Patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMI-BC) have excellent survival, however two-thirds develop recurrences. Tumor specific mutations can be used to detect recurrences in urine assays, presenting a more patient-friendly diagnostic procedure than cystoscopy. To address these issues, we developed a mutation assay for the simultaneous detection of 19 possible mutations in the HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes. With this assay and mutation assays for the FGFR3 and PIK3CA oncogenes, we screened primary bladder tumors of 257 patients and 184 recurrences from 54 patients. Additionally, in primary tumors p53 expression was obtained by immunohistochemistry. Of primary tumors 64% were mutant for FGFR3, 11% for RAS, 24% for PIK3CA, and 26% for p53. FGFR3 mutations were mutually exclusive with RAS mutations (p = 0.001) and co-occurred with PIK3CA mutations (p = 0.016). P53 overexpression was mutually exclusive with PIK3CA and FGFR3 mutations (p≤0.029). Mutations in the RAS and PIK3CA genes were not predictors for recurrence-free, progression-free and disease-specific survival. In patients presenting with NMI-BC grade 3 and MI-BC, 33 and 36% of the primary tumors were mutant. In patients with low-grade NMI-BC, 88% of the primary tumors carried a mutation and 88% of the recurrences were mutant. The mutation assays present a companion diagnostic to define patients for targeted therapies. In addition, the assays are a potential biomarker to detect recurrences during surveillance. We showed that 88% of patients presenting with low-grade NMI-BC are eligible for such a follow-up. This may contribute to a reduction in the number of cystoscopical examinations.	4
ClinGen's RASopathy Expert Panel consensus methods for variant interpretation. || Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Genetic Variation Genome, Human Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Information Dissemination Mutation Software United States || Standardized and accurate variant assessment is essential for effective medical care. To that end, Clinical Genome (ClinGen) Resource clinical domain working groups (CDWGs) are systematically reviewing disease-associated genes for sufficient evidence to support disease causality and creating disease-specific specifications of American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines for consistent and accurate variant classification. The ClinGen RASopathy CDWG established an expert panel to curate gene information and generate gene- and disease-specific specifications to ACMG-AMP variant classification framework. These specifications were tested by classifying 37 exemplar pathogenic variants plus an additional 66 variants in ClinVar distributed across nine RASopathy genes. RASopathy-related specifications were applied to 16 ACMG-AMP criteria, with 5 also having adjustable strength with availability of additional evidence. Another 5 criteria were deemed not applicable. Key adjustments to minor allele frequency thresholds, multiple de novo occurrence events and/or segregation, and strength adjustments impacted 60% of variant classifications. Unpublished case-level data from participating laboratories impacted 45% of classifications supporting the need for data sharing. RAS-specific ACMG-AMP specifications optimized the utility of available clinical evidence and Ras/MAPK pathway-specific characteristics to consistently classify RASopathy-associated variants. These specifications highlight how grouping genes by shared features promotes rapid multigenic variant assessment without sacrificing specificity and accuracy.	4

Elevated expression of p53 gain-of-function mutation R175H in endometrial cancer cells can increase the invasive phenotypes by activation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway. || Amino Acid Substitution Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement DNA, Complementary Down-Regulation Endometrial Neoplasms Enzyme Activation ErbB Receptors Female Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Phenotype Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt RNA Interference Signal Transduction Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers. In addition to the loss of tumor suppression function and exertion of dominant-negative effects over the remaining wild-type protein, several p53 mutants can gain novel oncogenic functions (gain-of-function, GOF) that actively regulate cancer development and progression. In human endometrial cancer, p53 mutation is more often associated with aggressive nonendometrioid cancer. However, it was unknown if p53 mutants contributed to endometrial cancer progression through the GOF properties. To clarify the relationship between expression of p53 GOF mutation (p53-R175H) and invasive potential of human endometrial cancer KLE cells, we tested the consequences of up-regulation and down-regulation of p53-R175H in KLE cells by inducing p53-R175H expression vector or suppressing the p53 gene with short hairpin RNA. We found that forced over-expression of p53-R175H significantly promoted cell migration and invasion, and induced activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Conversely, suppression of p53-R175H with short hairpin RNA significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion, and resulted in attenuation of EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings show for the first time that elevated expression of p53-R175H mutant may exert gain-of-function activity to activate the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway and thus may contribute to the invasive phenotype in endometrial cancer.	0

Characterization of functional domains necessary for mutant p53 gain of function. || Adenocarcinoma Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Chemokine CXCL1 Colony-Forming Units Assay Colorectal Neoplasms Humans Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2 Mutant Proteins Mutation RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor cells, including SW480 carcinoma cells that carry a mutant p53, are addicted to the mutant for their survival and resistance to growth suppression by chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we investigated whether various classes of p53 mutants share a common property and functional domains necessary for mutant p53 gain of function. To test this, we generated SW480 cell lines in which endogenous mutant R273H/P309S can be inducibly or stably knocked down, whereas a small interfering RNA-resistant mutant p53 along with a mutated functional domain can be inducibly or stably expressed. We found that both contact-site (R248W and R273H) and conformation (G245S and R249S) mutants are able to maintain the transformed phenotypes of SW480 cells conferred by endogenous mutant p53. We also found that activation domains 1-2 and the proline-rich domain are required for mutant p53 gain of function. Interestingly, we showed that the C-terminal basic domain, which is required for wild-type p53 activity, is an inhibitory domain for mutant p53. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the basic domain enhances, whereas a mutation in activation domains 1-2 and deletion of the proline-rich domain abolish mutant p53 to regulate Gro1 and Id2, both of which are regulated by and mediate endogenous mutant p53 gain of function. These results indicate that both conformation and contact-site mutants share a property for cell transformation, and the domains critical for wild-type p53 tumor suppression are also required for mutant p53 tumor promotion. Thus, the inhibitory basic domain and the common property for p53 mutants can be explored for targeting tumors with mutant p53.	0
Characterization of biological responses of colorectal cancer cells to anticancer regimens. ||  || Identification of subgroups of patients who differ in their response to treatment could help to establish which of the best available chemotherapeutic options are best, based on biological activity. In metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), novel molecular-targeted agents that act on pathways that regulate cell growth, the cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and invasion are being developed. Here, we employed an in vitro chemosensitivity assay to evaluate the biological efficacy of conventional monotherapies and combination chemotherapy with targeted drugs. The chemosensitivities of 12 CRC cell lines to the established regimens FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil [5-FU] + leucovorin + oxaliplatin) and FOLFIRI (5-FU + leucovorin + irinotecan) and to therapy with these regimens in combination with the biologically targeted drugs bevacizumab or cetuximab were comparatively evaluated for their effects on apoptotic and autophagic cell death processes, angiogenesis, and invasion. Each of the chemotherapeutic regimens promoted apoptotic cell death and invasion. All drug regimens caused significantly greater apoptotic cell death with activation of caspase-3 in SW480 cells compared to other cells, effects that were associated with a remarkable reduction in matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. The FOLFOX regimen more effectively promoted apoptotic cell death, angiogenesis, and invasion than the FOLFIRI regimen. Combination therapy with FOLFOX/FOLFIRI regimen and bevacizumab produced a moderate angiogenesis-blocking effect in most cell lines. The results validate our in vitro chemosensitivity assay, and suggest that it may be applied to help determine adequate regimens in individual CRC patients based on the biological characteristics of their tumors.	0
Occurrence of ocular melanoma thirteen years after skin melanoma: two separate primaries or metastatic disease? A case solved with NRAS and CDKN2A (INK4A-ARF) mutational analysis. || Base Sequence Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16 DNA Mutational Analysis Diagnosis, Differential Female Humans Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Time Factors Uveal Neoplasms ras Proteins || The differential diagnosis between primary uveal melanoma and cutaneous melanoma metastasis in the eye may be difficult, both clinically and histologically. We report successful application of combined mutational analysis of the NRAS and the CDKN2A gene to discriminate between these two entities. The patient had a history of a superficial spreading cutaneous melanoma of the left shoulder. Nine years later, she developed a lymph node metastasis in the left axilla, and 13 years later she presented with an atypical, pigmented tumor in the uvea. Histologically, the origin of the uveal melanoma could not be determined with certainty. We performed molecular analysis on the skin melanoma, the lymph node metastasis and the uveal melanoma. We detected an NRAS codon 61 mutation (c.182A>G, p.Gln61Arg) in all three tumor specimens. This mutation was absent in the normal control tissue of the patient, thereby excluding a germline mutation. To confirm a clonal relationship between the tumors, we also performed CDKN2A mutational analysis. We detected a CDKN2A mutation ((p16) c.238C>T, p.Arg80X, (p14) c.404C>T, p.Pro135Leu)) in the tumor samples, but not in the normal control tissue of the patient. We concluded that the uveal melanoma is a metastasis from the cutaneous melanoma removed 13 years before.	4
Out, in and back again: PtdIns(4,5)P(2) regulates cadherin trafficking in epithelial morphogenesis. || Actins Animals Cadherins Cell Membrane Cell Polarity Epithelium Exocytosis Humans Intercellular Junctions Metabolic Networks and Pathways Models, Biological Morphogenesis Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates Phosphatidylinositols Protein Transport || The morphogenesis of epithelial cells in the tissue microenvironment depends on the regulation of the forces and structures that keep cells in contact with their neighbours. The formation of cell-cell contacts is integral to the establishment and maintenance of epithelial morphogenesis. In epithelial tissues, the misregulation of the signalling pathways that control epithelial polarization induces migratory and invasive cellular phenotypes. Many cellular processes influence cadherin targeting and function, including exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling. However, the localized generation of the lipid messenger PtdIns(4,5)P(2) is emerging as a fundamental signal controlling all of these processes. The PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-generating enzymes, PIPKs (phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases) are therefore integral to these pathways. By the spatial and temporal targeting of PIPKs via the actions of its functional protein associates, PtdIns(4,5)P(2) is generated at discrete cellular locales to provide the cadherin-trafficking machinery with its required lipid messenger. In the present review, we discuss the involvement of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and the PIPKs in the regulation of the E-cadherin (epithelial cadherin) exocytic and endocytic machinery, the modulation of actin structures at sites of adhesion, and the direction of cellular pathways which determine the fate of E-cadherin and cell-cell junctions. Recent work is also described that has defined phosphoinositide-mediated E-cadherin regulatory pathways by the use of organismal models.	0
Exome Sequencing Identifies Potentially Druggable Mutations in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. || Adult Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma DNA Repair Exome Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms Sequence Analysis, DNA Signal Transduction Whole Exome Sequencing || In this study, we first performed whole exome sequencing of DNA from 10 untreated and clinically annotated fresh frozen nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies and matched bloods to identify somatically mutated genes that may be amenable to targeted therapeutic strategies. We identified a total of 323 mutations which were either non-synonymous (n = 238) or synonymous (n = 85). Furthermore, our analysis revealed genes in key cancer pathways (DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, immune response, lipid signaling) were mutated, of which those in the lipid-signaling pathway were the most enriched. We next extended our analysis on a prioritized sub-set of 37 mutated genes plus top 5 mutated cancer genes listed in COSMIC using a custom designed HaloPlex target enrichment panel with an additional 88 NPC samples. Our analysis identified 160 additional non-synonymous mutations in 37/42 genes in 66/88 samples. Of these, 99/160 mutations within potentially druggable pathways were further selected for validation. Sanger sequencing revealed that 77/99 variants were true positives, giving an accuracy of 78%. Taken together, our study indicated that ~72% (n = 71/98) of NPC samples harbored mutations in one of the four cancer pathways (EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR, NOTCH, NF-κB, DNA repair) which may be potentially useful as predictive biomarkers of response to matched targeted therapies.	4
Integrative bioinformatic analyses of an oncogenomic profile reveal the biology of endometrial cancer and guide drug discovery. || Biomarkers, Tumor Computational Biology Databases, Factual Drug Discovery Drug Repositioning Endometrial Neoplasms Female Genomics Humans Mutation Precision Medicine || A major challenge in personalized cancer medicine is to establish a systematic approach to translate huge oncogenomic datasets to clinical situations and facilitate drug discovery for cancers such as endometrial carcinoma. We performed a genome-wide somatic mutation-expression association study in a total of 219 endometrial cancer patients from TCGA database, by evaluating the correlation between ~5,800 somatic mutations to ~13,500 gene expression levels (in total, ~78, 500, 000 pairs). A bioinformatics pipeline was devised to identify expression-associated single nucleotide variations (eSNVs) which are crucial for endometrial cancer progression and patient prognoses. We further prioritized 394 biologically risky mutational candidates which mapped to 275 gene loci and demonstrated that these genes collaborated with expression features were significantly enriched in targets of drugs approved for solid tumors, suggesting the plausibility of drug repurposing. Taken together, we integrated a fundamental endometrial cancer genomic profile into clinical circumstances, further shedding light for clinical implementation of genomic-based therapies and guidance for drug discovery.	4
PRIMA-1MET induces apoptosis through accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species irrespective of p53 status and chemo-sensitivity in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial Cell Line, Tumor Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Female Humans Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial Ovarian Neoplasms Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1 Proteolysis Quinuclidines Reactive Oxygen Species Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || There is an intensive need for the development of novel drugs for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy due to the high recurrence rate. TP53 mutation is a common event in EOC, particularly in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, where it occurs in more than 90% of cases. Recently, PRIMA-1 and PRIMA‑1MET (p53 reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis and its methylated form) were shown to have an antitumor effect on several types of cancer. Despite that PRIMA-1MET is the first compound evaluated in clinical trials, the antitumor effects of PRIMA-1MET on EOC remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of PRIMA-1MET for the treatment of EOC cells. PRIMA-1MET treatment of EOC cell lines (n=13) resulted in rapid apoptosis at various concentrations (24 h IC50 2.6-20.1 µM). The apoptotic response was independent of the p53 status and chemo-sensitivity. PRIMA‑1MET treatment increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and PRIMA-1MET-induced apoptosis was rescued by an ROS scavenger. Furthermore, RNA expression analysis revealed that the mechanism of action of PRIMA‑1MET may be due to inhibition of antioxidant enzymes, such as Prx3 and GPx-1. In conclusion, our results suggest that PRIMA-1MET represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ovarian cancer irrespective of p53 status and chemo-sensitivity.	0
Phenylketonuria in the Greek population. Haplotype analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and identification of a PKU mutation. || Alleles Base Sequence Blotting, Southern DNA DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase Gene Amplification Gene Frequency Greece Haplotypes Humans Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || Haplotype analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene was performed on 27 chromosomes from a sample of 14 Greek phenylketonuria (PKU) probands and their parents. The majority (94%) of the 17 mutant PAH alleles are on haplotypes 1, 2 and 4, with haplotype 1 being most common. Sixty per cent of ten control PAH alleles are on haplotypes 1, 2 and 4. Haplotype 3 was not present in either group. A new MspI restriction site was found in exon 9 of a single mutant PAH allele on haplotype 7. The mutation responsible for the restriction site alteration is a T to C transition at nucleotide 1154 of the PAH cDNA, resulting in the conversion of codon 311 from leucine to proline (L311P). The same mutation has been described on a haplotype 1 allele in a German PKU patient. A single crossover event would be required to transfer this mutation from haplotype 1 to 7. Migration of this mutation from one haplotype to another by recombination cannot be distinguished from a recurrent mutation at this site.	1 3
CPe-III-S Metabolism in Vitro and in Vivo and Molecular Simulation of Its Metabolites Using a p53-R273H Mutant. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Dipeptides Female Humans MCF-7 Cells Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Molecular Docking Simulation Molecular Dynamics Simulation Pepsin A Peptide Fragments Protein Conformation Trypsin Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || It was previously found that CPe-III-S, synthesized according to the chickpea peptide CPe-III (RQSHFANAQP), exhibited an antiproliferative effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative mechanism of CPe-III-S. CPe-III-S was treated by pepsin and trypsin in a simulated gastrointestinal digestion environment as well as in an animal experiment. With HPLC-ESI-MS analysis, three peptide fragments of Ser-His, His-Phe, and Ala-Asn-Ala-Gln were identified. Ser-His was the only common product from both in vitro and in vivo environments. The specific bindings between three peptides and p53-R273H were performed by molecular docking, and the molecular dynamic simulation between Ser-His and p53-R273H revealed the stability of the binding complex. The binding free energy of the complex was -12.56 ± 1.03 kcal/mol with a reliable hydrogen bond between the ligand and Thr284 of p53. Ser-His may restore mutant p53-R273H activity or inhibit its binding with a downstream signal. This metabolite is a potential anticancer factor for suppressing cell proliferation.	0
ZEB1 induces EPB41L5 in the cancer mesenchymal program that drives ARF6-based invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. ||  || Onset of the cancer mesenchymal program is closely associated with cancer malignancy and drug resistance. Among the different epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated transcriptional factors, ZEB1 has a key role in inducing the mesenchymal phenotypes and stem cell-like properties of different breast cancer cells. ARF6 and its effector AMAP1 are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer cells, and promote invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. EPB41L5 is induced during EMT, and mediates the disruption of E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion and the promotion of focal adhesion dynamics. Here we show that EPB41L5 is an integral component of the ARF6-based pathway, which is induced by ZEB1. We found that EPB41L5 is expressed at high levels in malignant breast cancer cells and binds to AMAP1. ZEB1 induced EPB41L5 both in cancer cells and normal cells. This relationship was recaptured with The Cancer Genome Atlas RNASeq data set, and correlated with the poor outcome of the patients. In contrast, diversified events, such as tumor growth factor β1 stimulation, expression of SNAI1 and TP53 mutation, can each cause the induction of ZEB1 and EPB41L5, depending on the cellular context. Our results demonstrated that the ZEB1-EPB41L5 axis is at the core of the cancer mesenchymal program that drives ARF6-based invasion, metastasis and drug resistance of significant populations of primary breast cancers, and is tightly correlated with the poor outcomes of patients.	0

Somatic and Germline TP53 Alterations in Second Malignant Neoplasms from Pediatric Cancer Survivors. || Adolescent Cancer Survivors Child Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Loss of Heterozygosity Male Neoplasms Neoplasms, Second Primary Pediatrics Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Whole Exome Sequencing || Purpose: Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are severe late complications that occur in pediatric cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy and other genotoxic treatments. To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.Experimental Design: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germlineTP53 variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germlineTP53 in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.Results: WES revealedTP53 mutations involving p53's DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somaticTP53-mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis ofTP53-coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germlineTP53 variant.Conclusions: Currently, germlineTP53 is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germlineTP53 variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring.Clin Cancer Res; 23(7); 1852-61. ©2016 AACR.	4
Mapping the hallmarks of lung adenocarcinoma with massively parallel sequencing. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cohort Studies Exome Female Genes, Neoplasm Genome-Wide Association Study High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Mutation Rate || Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths per year worldwide. Here, we report exome and genome sequences of 183 lung adenocarcinoma tumor/normal DNA pairs. These analyses revealed a mean exonic somatic mutation rate of 12.0 events/megabase and identified the majority of genes previously reported as significantly mutated in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we identified statistically recurrent somatic mutations in the splicing factor gene U2AF1 and truncating mutations affecting RBM10 and ARID1A. Analysis of nucleotide context-specific mutation signatures grouped the sample set into distinct clusters that correlated with smoking history and alterations of reported lung adenocarcinoma genes. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed frequent structural rearrangements, including in-frame exonic alterations within EGFR and SIK2 kinases. The candidate genes identified in this study are attractive targets for biological characterization and therapeutic targeting of lung adenocarcinoma.	4
Pharmacological Enhancement of Mutated α-Glucosidase Activity in Fibroblasts from Patients with Pompe Disease. ||  || We investigated the use of pharmacological chaperones for the therapy of Pompe disease, a metabolic myopathy due to mutations of the gene encoding the lysosomal hydrolase α-glucosidase (GAA) and characterized by generalized glycogen storage in cardiac and skeletal muscle. We studied the effects of two imino sugars, deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), on residual GAA activity in fibroblasts from eight patients with different forms of Pompe disease (two classic infantile, two non-classic infantile onset, four late-onset forms), and with different mutations of the GAA gene. We demonstrated a significant increase of GAA activity (1.3-7.5-fold) after imino sugar treatment in fibroblasts from patients carrying the mutations L552P (three patients) and G549R (one patient). GAA enhancement was confirmed in HEK293T cells where the same mutations were overexpressed. No increase of GAA activity was observed for the other mutations. Western blot analysis showed that imino sugars increase the amount of mature GAA molecular forms. Immunofluorescence studies in HEK293T cells overexpressing the L552P mutation showed an improved trafficking of the mutant enzyme to lysosomes after imino sugar treatment. These results provide a rationale for an alternative treatment, other than enzyme replacement, to Pompe disease.	1
G-actin guides p53 nuclear transport: potential contribution of monomeric actin in altered localization of mutant p53. || Actins Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus Cross-Linking Reagents Doxorubicin Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutant Proteins Polymerization Protein Binding Protein Multimerization Protein Transport Rabbits Subcellular Fractions Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 preserves genomic integrity by restricting anomaly at the gene level. Till date, limited information is available for cytosol to nuclear shuttling of p53; except microtubule-based trafficking route, which utilizes minus-end directed motor dynein. The present study suggests that monomeric actin (G-actin) guides p53 traffic towards the nucleus. Histidine-tag pull-down assay using purified p53(1-393)-His and G-actin confirms direct physical association between p53 and monomeric G-actin. Co-immunoprecipitation data supports the same. Confocal imaging explores intense perinuclear colocalization between p53 and G-actin. To address atomistic details of the complex, constraint-based docked model of p53:G-actin complex was generated based on crystal structures. MD simulation reveals that p53 DNA-binding domain arrests very well the G-actin protein. Docking benchmark studies have been carried out for a known crystal structure, 1YCS (complex between p53DBD and BP2), which validates the docking protocol we adopted. Co-immunoprecipitation study using "hot-spot" p53 mutants suggested reduced G-actin association with cancer-associated p53 conformational mutants (R175H and R249S). Considering these findings, we hypothesized that point mutation in p53 structure, which diminishes p53:G-actin complexation results in mutant p53 altered subcellular localization. Our model suggests p53Arg249 form polar-contact with Arg357 of G-actin, which upon mutation, destabilizes p53:G-actin interaction and results in cytoplasmic retention of p53R249S.	0
TP53 mutation variant allele frequency is a potential predictor for clinical outcome of patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Chromosome Deletion Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5 Female Gene Frequency Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Mutation Myelodysplastic Syndromes Prognosis Risk Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || TP53 mutations are frequently detected in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); however, the clinical impact of these mutations on the disease course of patients with lower-risk MDS is unclear. In this study of 154 lower-risk MDS patients, TP53 mutations were identified in 13% of patients, with prevalence in patients with del(5q) (23.6%) compared to non-del(5q) (3.8%). Two-thirds of the mutations were detected at the time of diagnosis, and one-third were detected during the course of the disease. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a TP53 mutation was the strongest independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) (HR: 4.39) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 3.74). Evaluation of OS determined a TP53 variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold of 6% as an optimal cut-off for patient stratification. The median OS was 43.5 months in patients with mutations detected at the time of diagnosis and a mutational burden of > 6% VAF compared to 138 months (HR 12.2; p = 0.003) in patients without mutations; similarly, the median PFS was 20.2 months versus 116.6 months (HR 79.5; p < 0.0001). In contrast, patients with a mutational burden of < 6% VAF were stable for long periods without progression and had no significant impact on PFS or OS. Additionally, we found a high correlation in the mutational data from cells of the peripheral blood and those of the bone marrow, indicating that peripheral blood is a reliable source for mutation monitoring. Our results indicate that the clinical impact of TP53 mutations in lower-risk MDS patients depends on the level of mutational burden.	4
Genome profiling of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: frequent alterations of RAS and RUNX1 genes. || Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21 Comparative Genomic Hybridization Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit Gene Expression Profiling Genes, ras Humans Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic Mutation Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Sequence Analysis, DNA Signal Transduction Ubiquitin Thiolesterase || Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hematological disease close to, but separate from both myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) and myelodysplastic syndromes and may show either myeloproliferative (MP-CMML) or myelodysplastic (MD-CMML) features. Not much is known about the molecular biology of this disease. We studied a series of 30 CMML samples (13 MP- and 11 MD-CMMLs, and 6 acutely transformed cases) from 29 patients by using Agilent high density array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and sequencing of 12 candidate genes. Two-thirds of samples did not show any obvious alteration of aCGH profiles. In one-third we observed chromosome abnormalities (e.g. trisomy 8, del20q) and gain or loss of genes (e.g. NF1, RB1 and CDK6). RAS mutations were detected in 4 cases (including an uncommon codon 146 mutation in KRAS) and PTPN11 mutations in 3 cases. We detected 11 RUNX1 alterations (9 mutations and 2 rearrangements). The rearrangements were a new, cryptic inversion of chromosomal region 21q21-22 leading to break and fusion of RUNX1 to USP16. RAS and RUNX1 alterations were not mutually exclusive. RAS pathway mutations occurred in MP-CMMLs (approximately 46%) but not in MD-CMMLs. RUNX1 alterations (mutations and cryptic rearrangement) occurred in both MP and MD classes (~38%). We detected RAS pathway mutations and RUNX1 alterations. The latter included a new cryptic USP16-RUNX1 fusion. In some samples, two alterations coexisted already at this early chronic stage.	4

Gain-of-function p53 mutants co-opt chromatin pathways to drive cancer growth. || Acetylation Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Chromatin Female Genes, Tumor Suppressor Genome, Human Histone Acetyltransferases Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase Histones Humans Male Mice Mutant Proteins Mutation Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein Neoplasms Phenotype Protein Binding Protein Processing, Post-Translational Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53 (which encodes p53 protein) is the most frequently mutated gene among all human cancers. Prevalent p53 missense mutations abrogate its tumour suppressive function and lead to a 'gain-of-function' (GOF) that promotes cancer. Here we show that p53 GOF mutants bind to and upregulate chromatin regulatory genes, including the methyltransferases MLL1 (also known as KMT2A), MLL2 (also known as KMT2D), and acetyltransferase MOZ (also known as KAT6A or MYST3), resulting in genome-wide increases of histone methylation and acetylation. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas shows specific upregulation of MLL1, MLL2, and MOZ in p53 GOF patient-derived tumours, but not in wild-type p53 or p53 null tumours. Cancer cell proliferation is markedly lowered by genetic knockdown of MLL1 or by pharmacological inhibition of the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Our study reveals a novel chromatin mechanism underlying the progression of tumours with GOF p53, and suggests new possibilities for designing combinatorial chromatin-based therapies for treating individual cancers driven by prevalent GOF p53 mutations.	0
No evidence that protein truncating variants in BRIP1 are associated with breast cancer risk: implications for gene panel testing. || Adult Aged Breast Neoplasms Cohort Studies DNA-Binding Proteins European Continental Ancestry Group Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Middle Aged Mutation RNA Helicases Risk || BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1) is one of the Fanconi Anaemia Complementation (FANC) group family of DNA repair proteins. Biallelic mutations in BRIP1 are responsible for FANC group J, and previous studies have also suggested that rare protein truncating variants in BRIP1 are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. These studies have led to inclusion of BRIP1 on targeted sequencing panels for breast cancer risk prediction. We evaluated a truncating variant, p.Arg798Ter (rs137852986), and 10 missense variants of BRIP1, in 48 144 cases and 43 607 controls of European origin, drawn from 41 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Additionally, we sequenced the coding regions of BRIP1 in 13 213 cases and 5242 controls from the UK, 1313 cases and 1123 controls from three population-based studies as part of the Breast Cancer Family Registry, and 1853 familial cases and 2001 controls from Australia. The rare truncating allele of rs137852986 was observed in 23 cases and 18 controls in Europeans in BCAC (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.03, p=0.79). Truncating variants were found in the sequencing studies in 34 cases (0.21%) and 19 controls (0.23%) (combined OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70, p=0.75). These results suggest that truncating variants in BRIP1, and in particular p.Arg798Ter, are not associated with a substantial increase in breast cancer risk. Such observations have important implications for the reporting of results from breast cancer screening panels.	4
Oncogenic driver mutations, treatment, and EGFR-TKI resistance in a Caucasian population with non-small cell lung cancer: survival in clinical practice. ||  || Oncogenic driver mutations activating EGFR,ALK, orBRAF in NSCLC predict sensitivity to specific tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We provide data on prevalence, treatment and survival of driver-mutation positive NSCLC in a predominantly Caucasian population in routine clinical practice. NSCLC patients diagnosed from 2006-2015 with an EGFR-test result were included (n=265). Testing for EGFR,ALK, orBRAF was performed if specific TKI therapy was considered. Case-control analyses of overall survival (OS) comparing driver-mutation positive and negative patients were performed. 44 sensitizing EGFR mutations (17%), 8ALK translocations (7%, n=111) and 3BRAF mutations (8%, n=39) were detected in adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma. We did not find mutations in tumors without an adenocarcinoma-component. More than 90% of inoperable driver-mutation positive patients received TKI-therapy. Case-control analysis revealed improved OS of driver-mutation positive patients (39.6 vs. 19.4 months, HR 0.51). OS was improved in stage IV patients but not in stage I-III patients.OS of EGFR-TKI treated patients was similar for 1st and 2nd-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Patients not treated with EGFR-TKI had no benefit in OS. Re-biopsies obtained at progression revealed anEGFR-T790M mutation in 73% (n=11). These patients responded to the 3rd-generation EGFR-TKI osimertinib. Testing guided by predictive clinical parameters resulted in twice as high rates of mutation-positive patients than expected, and TKI treatment resulted in a strong long-term OS advantage. Testing for driver mutations is feasible in routine clinical practice, and identifies patients who benefit from TKI-therapy. OS compares favorably with OS in clinical studies.	4

We measured the FM area, sagittal and transverse diameters on preoperative CT scans in patients with bicoronal synostosis (n = 40) and age-matched control group (n = 18). Our study included 16 children with FGFR3 p.Pro250Arg mutation (mean age 6.1 months), 10 with TWIST-1 mutation (mean age7.6 months) and 14 patients with isolated bicoronal synostosis (mean age 6.1). We observed a significantly smaller FM area in FGFR3 group compared to control group and isolated brachycephaly group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.038, respectively). The mean FM area in FGFR3 group was 426.13 mm(2) (p = 0.001), while in TWIST-1 group was 476.34 mm(2) (p = 0.103), and in isolated brachycephaly group 489.43 mm(2) (p = 0.129) compared to control group: 528.90 mm(2). The posterior segment of the sagittal diameter of the FM and its width as well as the bi-interoccipital synchondrosis diameters were significantly smaller in FGFR3 group compared to control group. In TWIST-1 group, the only altered dimension was the FM anterior segment of the sagittal diameter (p = 0.008). We did not observe any significant alteration of FM in patients with isolated brachycephaly compared to control group. The FM area is significantly altered in FGFR3-related brachycephaly, whereas in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (TWIST-1 mutation) the mean FM area is similar to control group. This study confirms the importance of FGFRs on FM growth whereas TWIST-1 seems to have a minor role.	4

Wild-type p53 upregulates an early onset breast cancer-associated gene GAS7 to suppress metastasis via GAS7-CYFIP1-mediated signaling pathway. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Animals Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Female Focal Adhesion Kinase 1 Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Integrin beta1 Lymphatic Metastasis MCF-7 Cells Mice Nerve Tissue Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src) Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein Family || The early onset breast cancer patients (age ≤ 40) often display higher incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis, and poorer five-year survival than the late-onset patients. To identify the genes and molecules associated with poor prognosis of early onset breast cancer, we examined gene expression profiles from paired breast normal/tumor tissues, and coupled with Gene Ontology and public data base analysis. Our data showed that the expression of GAS7b gene was lower in the early onset breast cancer patients as compared to the elder patients. We found that GAS7 was associated with CYFIP1 and WAVE2 complex to suppress breast cancer metastasis via blocking CYFIP1 and Rac1 protein interaction, actin polymerization, and β1-integrin/FAK/Src signaling. We further demonstrated that p53 directly regulated GAS7 gene expression, which was inversely correlated with p53 mutations in breast cancer specimens. Our study uncover a novel regulatory mechanism of p53 in early onset breast cancer progression through GAS7-CYFIP1-mediated signaling pathways.	0
Mutation analysis of FGFR1-3 in 11 Japanese patients with syndromic craniosynostoses. || Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Asian Continental Ancestry Group Craniosynostoses DNA Mutational Analysis Diagnostic Imaging Facies Female Genetic Association Studies Genotype Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Japan Male Mutation Phenotype Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1 Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Syndrome || Syndromic craniosynostoses usually occur as single gene disorders. In this study, we analyzed FGFR1-3 genes in four patients with Crouzon syndrome (CS), four patients with Pfeiffer syndrome type 2 (PS-2), one patient with Jackson-Weiss syndrome (JWS), and two patients (sisters) with Muenke syndrome (MS). FGFR2 and FGFR3 mutations were identified in 10 of the 11 patients. Notably, we found a novel FGFR2 p.Asn549Thr mutation in a patient with CS, and a novel FGFR2 p.Ser347Cys mutation in a patient with JWS (thus, this patient was turned out to have an FGFR2-related PS-variant). We also identified an FGFR2 p.Ser252Leu mutation in a phenotypically normal father of a daughter with CS, and an FGFR3 p.Pro250Arg mutation in a mildly macrocephalic father of sisters with MS. These findings, together with previous data, imply that the same FGFR2 mutations can be associated with a wide range of phenotypes including clinically different forms of syndromic craniosynostosis and apparently normal phenotype, depending on other (epi)genetic and environmental factors. Thus, genetic studies are recommended not only for obviously affected individuals but also for family members with apparently normal phenotype or non-specific subtle abnormal phenotype, to allow for pertinent genetic counseling. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	4
Core domain mutant Y220C of p53 protein has a key role in copper homeostasis in case of free fatty acids overload. || Carrier Proteins Cation Transport Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Copper Fatty Acids, Nonesterified Gene Expression Regulation Hep G2 Cells Hepatocytes Homeostasis Humans Mitochondrial Proteins Mutation Protein Structure, Tertiary Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathology that includes a wide variety of clinical conditions ranging from simple steatosis to end-stage liver diseases. Despite the huge amount of researches, the molecular basis of NAFLD are still not fully understood. Recently, it was suggested a role for p53 in NAFLD pathogenesis. Among its targets there is Synthesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase 2 (SCO2), a copper chaperone, involved in both aerobic respiration and metal cellular excretion. Copper seems to play a role in NAFLD. It was demonstrated a low hepatic copper content in NAFLD patients, which correlates with metabolic syndrome parameters. Copper homeostasis deregulation, in fact, seems to be related to lipid metabolism alteration and insulin resistance. Here we provide evidence on the role of p53 in the modulation of copper homeostasis, in an experimental model of NAFLD. We used two different hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Huh 7.5.1, characterized by the presence of wt p53 and its Y220C mutant, respectively, treated with a free fatty acids (FFAs) solution. Interestingly, p53 activation correlated with the intracellular copper level maintenance. We demonstrated that, in hepatoma cell lines, core domain mutant Y220C of p53 affects the modulation of SCO2 and Copper transporter 1 (CTR1), influencing, in this way, intracellular copper homeostasis in presence of FFAs accumulation, and that the 220 residue of the protein is crucial for such control. The role of p53 we highlighted may have deep implications in clinical conditions where copper homeostasis is deregulated.	0
Spectrum of GJB2 mutations causing deafness in the British Bangladeshi population. || Adolescent Adult Bangladesh Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Cross-Sectional Studies Female Genes, Recessive Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans London Male Mutation || Mutations in Gap Junction Beta 2 (GJB2) (the gene encoding the protein Connexin 26) have been found to be a major cause of non-syndromic sensorineural recessive deafness. The mutations in GJB2 causing hearing impairment vary in different populations. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and spectrum of GJB2 mutations in prelingual deafness in a population of Bangladeshi origin in the UK. Cross-sectional survey. Community based audiology clinic and tertiary level genetics department. Fifty-three families (67 patients) with sensorineural hearing loss of unknown cause were included in the study. Detailed history and examination excluded syndromic and environmental causes of hearing loss in the subjects as far as possible. Genetic analysis was performed, specifically looking for mutations in the GJB2 gene. Of the 53 families, 14 were confirmed to have biallelic pathogenic mutations in GJB2 (26%). The most common mutations of GJB2 in this population were W24X, IVS1+1, M1V, W77X and Q124X, W24X being the most common mutation seen in 57% of patients. Mutations in GJB2 are responsible for over one quarter of non-syndromic sensorineural deafness in the British Bangladeshi population. It is recommended that all Bangladeshi patients with non-syndromic hearing loss should be first tested for GJB2 mutations before requesting other aetiological investigations.	4
Applying next generation sequencing with microdroplet PCR to determine the disease-causing mutations in retinal dystrophies. || Adult Aged DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Retinal Dystrophies || Inherited Retinal dystrophy (IRD) is a broad group of inherited retinal disorders with heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes. Next generation sequencing (NGS) methods have been broadly applied for analyzing patients with IRD. Here we report a novel approach to enrich the target gene panel by microdroplet PCR. This assay involved a primer library which targeted 3071 amplicons from 2078 exons comprised of 184 genes involved in retinal function and/or retinal development. We amplified the target regions using the RainDance target enrichment PCR method and sequenced the products using the MiSeq NGS platform. In this study, we analyzed 82 samples from 67 families with IRD. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that this procedure was able to reach 99% coverage of target sequences with an average sequence depth of reads at 119×. The variants detected by this study were filtered, validated, and prioritized by pathogenicity analysis. Genotypes and phenotypes were correlated by determining a consistent relationship in 38 propands (56.7%). Pathogenic variants in genes related to retinal function were found in another 11 probands (16.4%), but the clinical correlations showed inconsistencies and insufficiencies in these patients. The application of NGS in IRD clinical molecular diagnosis provides a powerful approach to exploring the etiology and pathology in patients. It is important for the clinical laboratory to interpret the molecular findings in the context of patient clinical presentations because accurate interpretation of pathogenic variants is critical for delivering solid clinical molecular diagnosis to clinicians and patients and improving the standard care of patients.	4
Whole-exome sequencing to identify the cause of congenital sensorineural hearing loss in carriers of a heterozygous GJB2 mutation. || Adult Austria Connexins Female Genetic Testing Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Prospective Studies Turkey Whole Exome Sequencing || Bi-allelic variations in the gap junction protein beta-2 (GJB2) gene cause up to 50% of cases of newborn hearing loss. Heterozygous pathogenic GJB2 variations are also fivefold overrepresented in idiopathic patient groups compared to the normal-hearing population. Whether hearing loss in this group is due to unidentified additional variations within GJB2 or variations in other deafness genes is unknown in most cases. Whole-exome sequencing offers an effective approach in the search for causative variations in patients with Mendelian diseases. In this prospective genetic cohort study, we initially investigated a family of Turkish origin suffering from congenital autosomal recessive hearing loss. An index patient and his normal-hearing father, both bearing a single heterozygous pathogenic c.262G>T (p.Ala88Ser) GJB2 transversion as well as the normal-hearing mother were investigated by means of whole-exome sequencing. Subsequently the genetic screening was extended to a hearing-impaired cohort of 24 families of Turkish origin. A homozygous missense c.5492G>T transversion (p.Gly1831Val) in the Myosin 15a gene, previously linked to deafness, was identified as causative in the index family. This very rare variant is not listed in any population in the Genome Aggregation Database. Subsequent screening of index patients from additional families of Turkish origin with recessive hearing loss identified the c.5492G>T variation in an additional family. Whole-exome sequencing may effectively identify the causes of idiopathic hearing loss in patients bearing heterozygous GJB2 variations.	4
Common Variants for Heart Failure. ||  || Heart failure (HF) is a common disease with high morbidity and mortality; however, none of the drugs available are now entirely optimal for the treatment of HF. In addition to various clinical diseases and environment influences, genetic factors also contribute to the development and progression of HF. Identifying the common variants for HF by genome-wide association studies will facilitate the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HF. This review summarizes the recently identified common variants for HF risk and outcome and discusses their implications for the clinic therapy.	4
Base-Position Error Rate Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing Applied to Circulating Tumor DNA in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Prospective Study. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung DNA, Neoplasm Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplastic Cells, Circulating Prognosis Prospective Studies || Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an approved noninvasive biomarker to test for the presence of EGFR mutations at diagnosis or recurrence of lung cancer. However, studies evaluating ctDNA as a noninvasive "real-time" biomarker to provide prognostic and predictive information in treatment monitoring have given inconsistent results, mainly due to methodological differences. We have recently validated a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to detect ctDNA. Using this new approach, we evaluated the clinical usefulness of ctDNA monitoring in a prospective observational series of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We recruited 124 patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC for ctDNA monitoring. The primary objective was to analyze the prognostic value of baseline ctDNA on overall survival. ctDNA was assessed by ultra-deep targeted NGS using our dedicated variant caller algorithm. Common mutations were validated by digital PCR. Out of the 109 patients with at least one follow-up marker mutation, plasma samples were contributive at baseline (n = 105), at first evaluation (n = 85), and at tumor progression (n = 66). We found that the presence of ctDNA at baseline was an independent marker of poor prognosis, with a median overall survival of 13.6 versus 21.5 mo (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.82, 95% CI 1.01-3.55, p = 0.045) and a median progression-free survival of 4.9 versus 10.4 mo (adjusted HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.67, p = 0.002). It was also related to the presence of bone and liver metastasis. At first evaluation (E1) after treatment initiation, residual ctDNA was an early predictor of treatment benefit as judged by best radiological response and progression-free survival. Finally, negative ctDNA at E1 was associated with overall survival independently of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (HR 3.27, 95% CI 1.66-6.40, p < 0.001). Study population heterogeneity, over-representation of EGFR-mutated patients, and heterogeneous treatment types might limit the conclusions of this study, which require future validation in independent populations. In this study of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC, we found that ctDNA detection using targeted NGS was associated with poor prognosis. The heterogeneity of lung cancer molecular alterations, particularly at time of progression, impairs the ability of individual gene testing to accurately detect ctDNA in unselected patients. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the clinical impact of earlier evaluation times at 1 or 2 wk. Supporting clinical decisions, such as early treatment switching based on ctDNA positivity at first evaluation, will require dedicated interventional studies.	4
Testing for NRAS Mutations in Serous Borderline Ovarian Tumors and Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinomas. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Sequence Analysis, DNA || The Idylla NRAS Mutation Test, performed on the Biocartis Idylla system, is anin vitro diagnostic tool for the qualitative assessment of 18NRAS mutations in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146. Low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSC) represents less than 10% of all serous ovarian carcinomas. LGSCs are believed to arise from preexisting cystadenomas or serous borderline tumors (SBOTs) that eventually progress to an invasive carcinoma. The molecular analysis of cancer-causing mutations and the development of targeted biological therapies constitute a milestone in the diagnosis and therapy of ovarian malignancies. According to some authors,NRAS may be an important oncogene for the progression of SBOT to a frankly invasive disease. The primary aim of this study was to verify if a fully integrated, real-time PCR-based Idylla system can be used for the rapid determination of theNRAS mutation status in patients with serous borderline ovarian tumors and low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. The study included tissue specimens from 12 patients with histopathologically verified ovarian masses, operated on at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz (Poland), between January 2009 and June 2012. The mean age of the study patients was 52.5 years (range 27-80 years). NRAS mutation in codon 13 (G13D, p.Gly13Asp; nucleotide: c.38G>A) was found in one patient, a woman with low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, our experiment was the first published study using the novel Idylla NRAS Mutation Test for the evaluation of ovarian tumors in a clinical setting. The Idylla platform is an interesting ancillary first-line rapid and fully automated instrument to detectNRAS mutations in SBOTs and LGSCs. However, the clinical usefulness of this method still needs to be verified in larger groups of cancer patients.	4
Hypoxic resistance of KRAS mutant tumor cells to 3-Bromopyruvate is counteracted by Prima-1 and reversed by N-acetylcysteine. || A549 Cells Acetylcysteine Aza Compounds Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic Cell Hypoxia Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Free Radical Scavengers GTP Phosphohydrolases Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glucose Transporter Type 1 Humans Lung Neoplasms Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Pyruvates Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The metabolic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) is a promising anti-cancer alkylating agent, shown to inhibit growth of some colorectal carcinoma with KRAS mutation. Recently, we demonstrated increased resistance to 3-BrPA in wt p53 tumor cells compared to those with p53 silencing or mutation. Since hypoxic microenvironments select for tumor cells with diminished therapeutic response, we investigated whether hypoxia unequally increases resistance to 3-BrPA in wt p53 MelJuso melanoma harbouring (Q61L)-mutant NRAS and wt BRAF, C8161 melanoma with (G12D)-mutant KRAS (G464E)-mutant BRAF, and A549 lung carcinoma with a KRAS (G12S)-mutation. Since hypoxia increases the toxicity of the p53 activator, Prima-1 against breast cancer cells irrespective of their p53 status, we also investigated whether Prima-1 reversed hypoxic resistance to 3-BrPA. In contrast to the high susceptibility of hypoxic mutant NRAS MelJuso cells to 3-BrPA or Prima-1, KRAS mutant C8161 and A549 cells revealed hypoxic resistance to 3-BrPA counteracted by Prima-1. In A549 cells, Prima-1 increased p21CDKN1mRNA, and reciprocally inhibited mRNA expression of the SLC2A1-GLUT1 glucose transporter-1 and ALDH1A1, gene linked to detoxification and stem cell properties. 3-BrPA lowered CAIX and VEGF mRNA expression. Death from joint Prima-1 and 3-BrPA treatment in KRAS mutant A549 and C8161 cells seemed mediated by potentiating oxidative stress, since it was antagonized by the anti-oxidant and glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine. This report is the first to show that Prima-1 kills hypoxic wt p53 KRAS-mutant cells resistant to 3-BrPA, partly by decreasing GLUT-1 expression and exacerbating pro-oxidant stress.	0
Is immunohistochemistry of BRAF V600E useful as a screening tool and during progression disease of melanoma patients? || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Disease Progression Early Detection of Cancer Female Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Reproducibility of Results Retrospective Studies Sensitivity and Specificity Young Adult || In clinical practice the gold standard method to assess BRAF status in patients with metastatic melanoma is based on molecular assays. Recently, a mutation-specific monoclonal antibody (VE1), which detects the BRAF V600E mutated protein, has been developed. With this study we aimed to confirm the clinical value of the VE1 Ventana® antibody, as today a univocal validated and accredited immunohistochemical procedure does not exist, to preliminary detect BRAF status in our routine diagnostic procedures. Moreover, we explored the biological meaning of BRAF immunohistochemical labeling both as a predictor marker of response to target therapy and, for the first time, as a player of acquired tumor drug resistance. We analyzed a retrospective series of 64 metastatic melanoma samples, previously investigated for molecular BRAF status, using a fully automatized immunohistochemical method. We correlated the data to the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients and their clinical outcome. The sensitivity and the specificity of the Ventana® VE1 antibody were 89.2 and 96.2% respectively, while the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 97.1 and 86.2%, respectively. For six mutated patients the histological sample before treatment and when disease progressed was available. The immunohistochemical BRAF V600E expression in the specimens when disease progressed was less intense and more heterogeneous compared to the basal expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that a less intense grade of positive expression is an independent predictor of a less aggressive stage at diagnosis (p = 0.0413). Our findings encourage the introduction of immunohistochemistry as a rapid screening tool for the assessment of BRAF status in melanoma patients in routine diagnostic procedures and prepare the ground for other studies to highlight the role of immunohistochemical BRAF V600E expression in patients at the time of progression.	4
Genomic Analysis of Uterine Lavage Fluid Detects Early Endometrial Cancers and Reveals a Prevalent Landscape of Driver Mutations in Women without Histopathologic Evidence of Cancer: A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cross-Sectional Studies DNA, Neoplasm Endometrial Neoplasms Female Genome Humans Middle Aged Mutation Prospective Studies Therapeutic Irrigation Uterus || Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, and its incidence and associated mortality are increasing. Despite the immediate need to detect these cancers at an earlier stage, there is no effective screening methodology or protocol for endometrial cancer. The comprehensive, genomics-based analysis of endometrial cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed many of the molecular defects that define this cancer. Based on these cancer genome results, and in a prospective study, we hypothesized that the use of ultra-deep, targeted gene sequencing could detect somatic mutations in uterine lavage fluid obtained from women undergoing hysteroscopy as a means of molecular screening and diagnosis. Uterine lavage and paired blood samples were collected and analyzed from 107 consecutive patients who were undergoing hysteroscopy and curettage for diagnostic evaluation from this single-institution study. The lavage fluid was separated into cellular and acellular fractions by centrifugation. Cellular and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were isolated from each lavage. Two targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels, one composed of 56 genes and the other of 12 genes, were used for ultra-deep sequencing. To rule out potential NGS-based errors, orthogonal mutation validation was performed using digital PCR and Sanger sequencing. Seven patients were diagnosed with endometrial cancer based on classic histopathologic analysis. Six of these patients had stage IA cancer, and one of these cancers was only detectable as a microscopic focus within a polyp. All seven patients were found to have significant cancer-associated gene mutations in both cell pellet and cfDNA fractions. In the four patients in whom adequate tumor sample was available, all tumor mutations above a specific allele fraction were present in the uterine lavage DNA samples. Mutations originally only detected in lavage fluid fractions were later confirmed to be present in tumor but at allele fractions significantly less than 1%. Of the remaining 95 patients diagnosed with benign or non-cancer pathology, 44 had no significant cancer mutations detected. Intriguingly, 51 patients without histopathologic evidence of cancer had relatively high allele fraction (1.0%-30.4%), cancer-associated mutations. Participants with detected driver and potential driver mutations were significantly older (mean age mutated = 57.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.30-∞, mean age no mutations = 50.35; p-value = 0.002; Benjamini-Hochberg [BH] adjusted p-value = 0.015) and more likely to be post-menopausal (p-value = 0.004; BH-adjusted p-value = 0.015) than those without these mutations. No associations were detected between mutation status and race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes, parity, and smoking status. Long-term follow-up was not presently available in this prospective study for those women without histopathologic evidence of cancer. Using ultra-deep NGS, we identified somatic mutations in DNA extracted both from cell pellets and a never previously reported cfDNA fraction from the uterine lavage. Using our targeted sequencing approach, endometrial driver mutations were identified in all seven women who received a cancer diagnosis based on classic histopathology of tissue curettage obtained at the time of hysteroscopy. In addition, relatively high allele fraction driver mutations were identified in the lavage fluid of approximately half of the women without a cancer diagnosis. Increasing age and post-menopausal status were associated with the presence of these cancer-associated mutations, suggesting the prevalent existence of a premalignant landscape in women without clinical evidence of cancer. Given that a uterine lavage can be easily and quickly performed even outside of the operating room and in a physician's office-based setting, our findings suggest the future possibility of this approach for screening women for the earliest stages of endometrial cancer. However, our findings suggest that further insight into development of cancer or its interruption are needed before translation to the clinic.	4
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid represses glioma stem-like cells. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glioblastoma Glioma Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Histone Deacetylases Humans Hydroxamic Acids Mice Neoplastic Stem Cells Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vorinostat Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases || Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) are proposed to be responsible for high resistance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment. In order to find new strategies aimed at reducing GSC stemness and improving GBM patient survival, we investigated the effects and mechanism of a histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), since HDAC activity has been linked to cancer stem-like cell (CSC) abundance and properties. Human GBM cell lines were plated in serum-free suspension cultures allowed for sphere forming and CSC enrichment. Subsequently, upon SAHA treatment, the stemness markers, cell proliferation, and viability of GSCs as well as cellular apoptosis and senescence were examined in order to clarify whether inhibition of GSCs occurs. We demonstrated that SAHA attenuated cell proliferation and diminished the expression stemness-related markers (CD133 and Bmi1) in GSCs. Furthermore, at high concentrations (more than 5 μM), SAHA triggered apoptosis of GSCs accompanied by increases in both activation of caspase 8- and caspase 9-mediated pathways. Interestingly, we found that a lower dose of SAHA (1 μM and 2.5 μM) inhibited GSCs via cell cycle arrest and induced premature senescence through p53 up-regulation and p38 activation. SAHA induces apoptosis and functions as a potent modulator of senescence via the p38-p53 pathway in GSCs. Our results provide a perspective on targeting GSCs via SAHA treatment, and suggest that SAHA could be used as a potent agent to overcome drug resistance in GBM patients.	0
Nucleotide excision repair deficiency in melanoma in response to UVA. ||  || The causative link between UV exposure and melanoma development is well known, however the mechanistic relationship remains incompletely characterised. UVA and UVB components of sunlight are implicated in melanomagenesis; however the majority of studies have focused on the effects of UVB and UVC light. Interestingly, melanoma tumour sequencing has revealed an overrepresentation of mutations signature of unrepaired UV-induced DNA damage. Repair of UVA-induced DNA damage is thought to occur primarily through the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway, which recognises and repairs damage either coupled to transcription (Transcription Coupled Repair; TCR), or through global genome scanning (Global Genome Repair; GGR). Current literature suggests NER is deficient in melanoma, however the cause of this remains unknown; and whether reduced NER activity in response to UVA may be involved in melanoma development remains uncharacterised. In this study we aimed to determine if melanoma cells exhibit reduced levels of NER activity in response to UVA. Melanocyte and melanoma cell lines were UVA-irradiated, and DNA damage levels assessed by immunodetection of Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimer (CPD) and (6-4) Photoproduct [(6-4)PP] lesions. Expression of NER pathway components and p53 following UVA treatment was quantified by qPCR and western blot. UVA did not induce detectable induction of (6-4)PP lesions, consistent with previous studies. Repair of CPDs induced by UVA was initiated at 4 h and complete within 48 h in normal melanocytes, whereas repair initiation was delayed to 24 h and >40 % of lesions remained in melanoma cell lines at 48 h. This was coupled with a delayed and reduced induction of GGR component XPC in melanoma cells, independent of p53. These findings support that NER activity is reduced in melanoma cells due to deficient GGR. Further investigation into the role of NER in UVA-induced melanomagenesis is warranted and may have implications for melanoma treatment.	0
[Study on nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment mutations of GJB2 gene in Uyghur patients in Xinjiang]. ||  || To study mutations in the GJB2 gene in Uyghur patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment from Xinjiang. Forty-three cases with nonsyndromic hearing impairment and 46 adults with normal hearing were performed mutational analysis of the GJB2 coding region by PCR-direct sequencing. Six kinds of mutation have been found in the encoding region of hearing impairment group: 380G>A, 109G>A, 235 delC, 233 delC, 7G0>A, 35 delG, of which one 235 delC case is heterozygotes mutation, two 233 delC are homozygotes mutation and two 35 delG are heterozygotes mutation. Six kinds of mutations have been found in the normal hearing group, of which 5 kinds are confirmed common polymorphic mutation. The GJB2 gene mutation detection rate in the Uyghur deaf population of Xinjiang Province is lower than other province, which has ethnic and regional characteristics.	4
Mapping the structural and dynamical features of multiple p53 DNA binding domains: insights into loop 1 intrinsic dynamics. || Amino Acid Sequence Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Molecular Dynamics Simulation Molecular Sequence Data Principal Component Analysis Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Structure, Secondary Protein Structure, Tertiary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The transcription factor p53 regulates cellular integrity in response to stress. p53 is mutated in more than half of cancerous cells, with a majority of the mutations localized to the DNA binding domain (DBD). In order to map the structural and dynamical features of the DBD, we carried out multiple copy molecular dynamics simulations (totaling 0.8 μs). Simulations show the loop 1 to be the most dynamic element among the DNA-contacting loops (loops 1-3). Loop 1 occupies two major conformational states: extended and recessed; the former but not the latter displays correlations in atomic fluctuations with those of loop 2 (~24 Å apart). Since loop 1 binds to the major groove whereas loop 2 binds to the minor groove of DNA, our results begin to provide some insight into the possible mechanism underpinning the cooperative nature of DBD binding to DNA. We propose (1) a novel mechanism underlying the dynamics of loop 1 and the possible tread-milling of p53 on DNA and (2) possible mutations on loop 1 residues to restore the transcriptional activity of an oncogenic mutation at a distant site.	0
Bayesian model to detect phenotype-specific genes for copy number data. || Algorithms Bayes Theorem Computer Simulation Female Gene Dosage Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genotype HapMap Project Humans Male Models, Genetic Models, Statistical Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || An important question in genetic studies is to determine those genetic variants, in particular CNVs, that are specific to different groups of individuals. This could help in elucidating differences in disease predisposition and response to pharmaceutical treatments. We propose a Bayesian model designed to analyze thousands of copy number variants (CNVs) where only few of them are expected to be associated with a specific phenotype. The model is illustrated by analyzing three major human groups belonging to HapMap data. We also show how the model can be used to determine specific CNVs related to response to treatment in patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The model is also extended to address the problem of how to adjust for confounding covariates (e.g., population stratification). Through a simulation study, we show that the proposed model outperforms other approaches that are typically used to analyze this data when analyzing common copy-number polymorphisms (CNPs) or complex CNVs. We have developed an R package, called bayesGen, that implements the model and estimating algorithms. Our proposed model is useful to discover specific genetic variants when different subgroups of individuals are analyzed. The model can address studies with or without control group. By integrating all data in a unique model we can obtain a list of genes that are associated with a given phenotype as well as a different list of genes that are shared among the different subtypes of cases.	4
PtdIns(4,5)P2-mediated cell signaling: emerging principles and PTEN as a paradigm for regulatory mechanism. || Animals Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Humans Membrane Proteins Molecular Dynamics Simulation PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate Signal Transduction || PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) is a relatively common anionic lipid that regulates cellular functions by multiple mechanisms. Hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by phospholipase C yields inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Phosphorylation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase yields PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which is a potent signal for survival and proliferation. Also, PtdIns(4,5)P2 can bind directly to integral and peripheral membrane proteins. As an example of regulation by PtdIns(4,5)P2, we discuss phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in detail. PTEN is an important tumor suppressor and hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. PtdIns(4,5)P2 enhances PTEN association with the plasma membrane and activates its phosphatase activity. This is a critical regulatory mechanism, but a detailed description of this process from a structural point of view is lacking. The disordered lipid bilayer environment hinders structural determinations of membrane-bound PTEN. A new method to analyze membrane-bound protein measures neutron reflectivity for proteins bound to tethered phospholipid membranes. These methods allow determination of the orientation and shape of membrane-bound proteins. In combination with molecular dynamics simulations, these studies will provide crucial structural information that can serve as a foundation for our understanding of PTEN regulation in normal and pathological processes.	0
Genotype-phenotype correlation in Costello syndrome: HRAS mutation analysis in 43 cases. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Diagnosis, Differential Female Genotype Humans Infant Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Syndrome || Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare multiple congenital abnormality syndrome, associated with failure to thrive and developmental delay. One of the more distinctive features in childhood is the development of facial warts, often nasolabial and in other moist body surfaces. Individuals with CS have an increased risk of malignancy, suggested to be about 17%. Recently, mutations in the HRAS gene on chromosome 11p13.3 have been found to cause CS. We report here the results of HRAS analysis in 43 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CS. Mutations were found in 37 (86%) of patients. Analysis of parental DNA samples was possible in 16 cases for both parents and in three cases for one parent, and confirmed the mutations as de novo in all of these cases. Three novel mutations (G12C, G12E, and K117R) were found in five cases. These results confirm that CS is caused, in most cases, by heterozygous missense mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS. Analysis of the major phenotypic features by mutation suggests a potential correlation between malignancy risk and genotype, which is highest for patients with an uncommon (G12A) substitution. These results confirm that mutation testing for HRAS is a reliable diagnostic test for CS.	4
Testing for an unusual distribution of rare variants. || Algorithms Analysis of Variance Computer Simulation Data Interpretation, Statistical Genetic Variation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Models, Statistical || Technological advances make it possible to use high-throughput sequencing as a primary discovery tool of medical genetics, specifically for assaying rare variation. Still this approach faces the analytic challenge that the influence of very rare variants can only be evaluated effectively as a group. A further complication is that any given rare variant could have no effect, could increase risk, or could be protective. We propose here the C-alpha test statistic as a novel approach for testing for the presence of this mixture of effects across a set of rare variants. Unlike existing burden tests, C-alpha, by testing the variance rather than the mean, maintains consistent power when the target set contains both risk and protective variants. Through simulations and analysis of case/control data, we demonstrate good power relative to existing methods that assess the burden of rare variants in individuals.	4
Double mutant P53 (N340Q/L344R) promotes hepatocarcinogenesis through upregulation of Pim1 mediated by PKM2 and LncRNA CUDR. || Animals Carrier Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Heterografts Humans Liver Neoplasms Membrane Proteins Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Nude Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1 RNA, Long Noncoding Thyroid Hormones Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || P53 is frequently mutated in human tumors as a novel gain-of-function to promote tumor development. Although dimeric (M340Q/L344R) influences on tetramerisation on site-specific post-translational modifications of p53, it is not clear how dimeric (M340Q/L344R) plays a role during hepatocarcinogenesis. Herein, we reveal that P53 (N340Q/L344R) promotes hepatocarcinogenesis through upregulation of PKM2. Mechanistically, P53 (N340Q/L344R) forms complex with CUDR and the complex binds to the promoter regions of PKM2 which enhances the expression, phosphorylation of PKM2 and its polymer formation. Thereby, the polymer PKM2 (tetramer) binds to the eleventh threonine on histone H3 that increases the phosphorylation of the eleventh threonine on histone H3 (pH3T11). Furthermore, pH3T11 blocks HDAC3 binding to H3K9Ac that prevents H3K9Ac from deacetylation and stabilizes the H3K9Ac modification. On the other hand, it also decreased tri-methylation of histone H3 on the ninth lysine (H3K9me3) and increases one methylation of histone H3 on the ninth lysine (H3K9me1). Moreover, the combination of H3K9me1 and HP1 α forms more H3K9me3-HP1α complex which binds to the promoter region of Pim1, enhancing the expression of Pim1 that enhances the expression of TERT, oncogenic lncRNA HOTAIR and reduces the TERRA expression. Ultimately, P53 (N340Q/L344R) accerlerates the growth of liver cancer cells Hep3B by activating telomerase and prolonging telomere through the cascade of P53 (N340Q/L344R)-CUDR-PKM2-pH3T11- (H3K9me1-HP1α)-Pim1- (TERT-HOTAIR-TERRA). Understanding the novel functions of P53 (N340Q/L344R) will help in the development of new liver cancer therapeutic approaches that may be useful in a broad range of cancer types.	0

Novel myosin-based therapies for congenital cardiac and skeletal myopathies. || Animals Cardiomyopathies Humans Muscular Diseases Myosins || The dysfunction in a number of inherited cardiac and skeletal myopathies is primarily due to an altered ability of myofilaments to generate force and motion. Despite this crucial knowledge, there are, currently, no effective therapeutic interventions for these diseases. In this short review, we discuss recent findings giving strong evidence that genetically or pharmacologically modulating one of the myofilament proteins, myosin, could alleviate the muscle pathology. This should constitute a research and clinical priority.	4
A ras-mutated peptide targeted by CTL infiltrating a human melanoma lesion. || Animals Antigens, Neoplasm COS Cells Cells, Cultured Clone Cells Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte HLA-A Antigens Humans Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating Melanoma Oncogene Protein p21(ras) Peptides Point Mutation T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic Tumor Cells, Cultured || Ags derived from commonly mutated oncogenic proteins seem ideally suited as targets for tumor immunotherapy. Nonetheless, only a few mutated epitopes efficiently presented by human tumors have thus far been identified. We describe here an approach to identify such epitopes. This approach involves: 1) identifying tumors expressing a ras mutation and isolating the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); 2) transfecting COS cells to induce expression of unknown mutated peptides in the context of a patient's HLA class I molecules; and 3) screening epitope recognition by using TIL from the tumors expressing a ras mutation. By using this approach, there appeared to be a N-ras mutation (a glutamine-to-arginine exchange at residue 61 (Q61R)), detected in a melanoma lesion, which was recognized specifically by the autologous TIL in the HLA-A*0101 context. The ras peptide 55-64(Q61R) was the epitope of these TIL and was regularly presented by Q61R-mutated HLA-A*0101(+) melanoma cell lines. This peptide and its wild-type homolog (55-64(wt)) bound to HLA-A*0101 with similar affinities. However, only the mutated peptide could induce specific CTL expansion from PBL. All the CTL clones specific to the mutated peptide, failed to recognize the wild-type sequence on both COS and melanoma cells. These data thus show that oncogenic protein mutations can create shared tumor-specific CTL epitopes, efficiently presented by tumor cells, and that screening for oncogene-transfected COS cell recognition by TIL (from tumors containing mutations) is a powerful approach for the identification of these epitopes.	0
GJB2 c.-23+1G>A mutation is second most common mutation among Iranian individuals with autosomal recessive hearing loss. || Connexin 26 Connexins Gene Frequency Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Iran Mutation || GJB2 mutation analysis is used routinely as a first step in genetic testing for autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Although most GJB2 mutations can be detected by sequencing of the exon 2 of this gene, a prevalent splice mutation, c.-23+1G>A (IVS1+1G>A), is not usually included in the analyzed region. In this study, we have developed an ARMS-PCR strategy for detection of this mutation among Iranian deaf individuals. A total of 418 Iranian individuals with hearing loss consistent with autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss based on audiological test result, medical history, physical examination and pedigree of the family, were included in this study. c.35delG and c.-23+1G>A mutations were detected by using ARMS-PCR. Direct sequencing of the exon 2 of the GJB2 gene was performed for mutation analysis of the coding region of this gene. Among 418 investigated cases, a total of 81 patients (~19.4 %) with biallelic pathogenic mutations in the GJB2 gene and 13 cases with only one pathogenic mutant allele were identified. The total allele frequencies of the two most frequent mutations, c.35delG and c.-23+1G>A, among mutated alleles were found to be around 59 and 15.7 %, respectively. High frequency of the c.35delG and c.-23+1G>A mutations among Iranian deaf individuals shows the importance of developing rapid and cost-effective methods for primary mutation screening methods before performing direct sequencing.	4
Lower metabolic rate in individuals heterozygous for either a frameshift or a functional missense MC4R variant. || Amino Acid Substitution Arginine Arizona Basal Metabolism Body Mass Index DNA Transposable Elements Frameshift Mutation Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Variation Glutamine Humans Hyperinsulinism Hyperphagia Indians, North American Mutation, Missense Obesity Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Prevalence Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 || Humans with functional variants in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) are obese, hyperphagic, and hyperinsulinemic but have been reported to have no difference in energy expenditure. We investigated the association of two MC4R variants, Arg165Gln (R165Q) and A insertion at nucleotide 100 (NT100), with adiposity in 3,074 full-heritage Pima Indians, a subset of whom had metabolic measures including 24-h energy expenditure (n = 252) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) (n = 364). Among the 3,074 subjects, 43 were heterozygous for R165Q and 14 for NT100 (frequency = 0.007 and 0.002). Mean (+/- SD) BMI was higher among subjects with R165Q (39.3 +/- 8.6 kg/m(2)) or NT100 (41.2 +/- 7.8) than subjects without either variant (37.1 +/- 8.4) (P = 0.04 and 0.02, adjusted for age, sex, and birth year and accounting for family membership). The 24-h energy expenditure (four with NT100; three with R165Q) or RMR (six with NT100; two with R165Q) was lower in heterozygous subjects but only met statistical significance when heterozygous subjects were combined and compared with subjects without either variant: least-squares means, 2,163 kcal/24 h (95% CI 2,035-2,291) vs. 2,307 kcal/24 h (2,285-2,328), P = 0.03 for 24-h energy expenditure, and 1,617 kcal/24 h (1,499-1,734) vs. 1,754 kcal/24 h (1,736-1,772), P = 0.02 for RMR; adjusted for age, sex, fat-free mass, and fat mass). For RMR, this difference persisted, even after accounting for family membership. Pima Indians heterozygous for R165Q or NT100 in MC4R have higher BMIs and lower energy expenditure (by approximately 140 kcal/day), indicating that lower energy expenditure was a component of the increased adiposity.	4
Reduced penetrance of the PSEN1 H163Y autosomal dominant Alzheimer mutation: a 22-year follow-up study. ||  || The range of onset ages within some PSEN1 families is wide, and a few cases of reduced penetrance of PSEN1 mutations have been reported. However, published data on reduced penetrance have been limited to clinical histories, often collected retrospectively and lacking biomarker information. We present a case of reduced penetrance of the PSEN1 H163Y mutation in a carrier prospectively followed for 22 years. Two brothers (A and B), both carriers of the H163Y mutation, were followed between 1995 and 2017. They underwent repeated clinical evaluations, neuropsychological assessments, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, as well as brain imaging examinations with structural magnetic resonance, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and [11C]Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. Brother A was followed between 44 and 64 years of age. Cognitive symptoms due to Alzheimer's disease set in at the age of 54. Gradual worsening of symptoms resulted in admittance to a nursing home owing to dependence on others for all activities of daily living. He showed a curvilinear decline in cognitive function on neuropsychological tests, and changes on magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid supported a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Brother A died at the age of 64 and fulfilled the criteria for definitive Alzheimer's disease according to neuropathological examination results. Brother B was followed between the ages of 43 and 65 and showed no cognitive deterioration on repeated neuropsychological test occasions. In addition, no biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology was detected, either on imaging examinations or in cerebrospinal fluid. The average (SD) age of symptom onset for PSEN1 H163Y is 51 ± 7 years according to previous studies. However, we present a case of a biomarker-verified reduction in penetrance in a mutation carrier who was still symptom-free at the age of 65. This suggests that other genetic, epigenetic, and/or environmental factors modify the onset age.	4
Targeted next generation sequencing of parotid gland cancer uncovers genetic heterogeneity. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Staging Parotid Neoplasms Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Time Factors Treatment Outcome || Salivary gland cancer represents a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors. Due to their low incidence and the existence of multiple morphologically defined subtypes, these tumors are still poorly understood with regard to their molecular pathogenesis and therapeutically relevant genetic alterations.Performing a systematic and comprehensive study covering 13 subtypes of salivary gland cancer, next generation sequencing was done on 84 tissue samples of parotid gland cancer using multiplex PCR for enrichment of cancer related gene loci covering hotspots of 46 cancer genes.Mutations were identified in 22 different genes. The most frequent alterations affected TP53, followed by RAS genes, PIK3CA, SMAD4 and members of the ERB family. HRAS mutations accounted for more than 90% of RAS mutations, occurring especially in epithelial-myoepithelial carcinomas and salivary duct carcinomas. Additional mutations in PIK3CA also affected particularly epithelial-myoepithelial carcinomas and salivary duct carcinomas, occurring simultaneously with HRAS mutations in almost all cases, pointing to an unknown and therapeutically relevant molecular constellation. Interestingly, 14% of tumors revealed mutations in surface growth factor receptor genes including ALK, HER2, ERBB4, FGFR, cMET and RET, which might prove to be targetable by new therapeutic agents. 6% of tumors revealed mutations in SMAD4.In summary, our data provide novel insight into the fundamental molecular heterogeneity of salivary gland cancer, relevant in terms of tumor classification and the establishment of targeted therapeutic concepts.	4
One man, one disease? ||  || We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with a strong family history of malignancy who presented with immature teratoma and gliomatosis peritonei. Despite first and second line chemotherapy, the disease ran an unusually refractory course. Although the presentation was not the typical tumour presentation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), we proceeded to undertake tumour genetic testing of the patient and her parents. LFS was diagnosed in this patient and her father with a sequence variation of CGG>TGG, R248W, which is one of the most common transcriptionally inactive mutations detected in LFS. Genetic counselling was offered to the father. A tumour screening programme and genetic screening for the p53 gene mutation for the surviving family members can be offered once consent is obtained from the father. This case illustrates the importance of cancer genetic study, even if the tumour presentation is not typical for any familial cancer syndrome.	4
Fuse binding protein antagonizes the transcription activity of tumor suppressor protein p53. || Biomarkers, Tumor Calcium-Binding Proteins Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 DNA Helicases DNA-Binding Proteins Gene Knockdown Techniques Humans Liver Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Stress, Physiological Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || FUSE binding protein1 (FBP1) is a transactivator of transcription of human c-myc proto-oncogene and expressed mainly in undifferentiated cells. It is also present in differentiated normal cells albeit with very low background. FBP1 is abundantly expressed in the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma tumors and has been implicated in tumor development. Although it down-regulates the expression of proapoptotic p21 protein, it is not known whether FBP1 also interacts and antagonizes the function of tumor suppressor protein p53. Western blotting was carried out to detect the expression level of FBP1, p21 and p53, and also p53 regulatory factors, BCCIP and TCTP; real-time quantitative PCR was done to determine the fold change in mRNA levels of target proteins; immunoprecipitation was carried out to determine the interaction of FBP1 with p53, BCCIP and TCTP. Cells stably knockdown for either FBP1; p53 or BCCIP were examined for p53 reporter activity under normal and radiation-induced stress. FBP1 physically interacted with p53, impairing its transcription activity and reducing p53-mediated sensitivity to cellular stress. Knockdown of FBP1 expression activated p53-mediated response to cellular stress while transient expression of FBP1 in FBP-knockdown cells restored the inhibition of p53 activity. FBP1 not only interacted with both BCCIP and TCTP, which, respectively, function as positive and negative regulators of p53, but also regulated their expression under cellular stress. In FBP knockdown cells, TCTP expression was down-regulated under radiation-induced stress whereas expression of BCCIP and p21 were significantly up-regulated suggesting FBP1 as a potential regulator of these proteins. We hypothesize that the FBP1-mediated suppression of p53 activity may occur via preventing the interaction of p53 with BCCIP as well as by FBP1-mediated regulation of p53 regulatory proteins, TCTP and BCCIP. Since FBP1 suppresses p53 activity and is overexpressed in most HCC tumors, it may have a possible role in tumorigenesis. FBP1 physically interacts with p53, functions as a regulator of p53-regulatory proteins (TCTP and BCCIP), and suppresses p53 transactivation activity under radiation-induced cellular stress. Since it is abundantly expressed in most HCC tumors, it may have implication in tumorigenesis and thus may be a possible target for drug development.	0
C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat exerts toxicity in a stable, inducible motor neuronal cell model, which is rescued by partial depletion of Pten. || Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis C9orf72 Protein Cell Line Cell Survival DNA Repeat Expansion Frontotemporal Dementia Gene Expression Regulation Gene Knockdown Techniques Humans Motor Neurons PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt RNA || Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and incurable neurodegenerative disease, characterised by progressive failure of the neuromuscular system. A (G4C2)n repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). To date, the balance of evidence indicates that the (G4C2)n repeat causes toxicity and neurodegeneration via a gain-of-toxic function mechanism; either through direct RNA toxicity or through the production of toxic aggregating dipeptide repeat proteins. Here, we have generated a stable and isogenic motor neuronal NSC34 cell model with inducible expression of a (G4C2)102 repeat, to investigate the gain-of-toxic function mechanisms. The expression of the (G4C2)102 repeat produces RNA foci and also undergoes RAN translation. In addition, the expression of the (G4C2)102 repeat shows cellular toxicity. Through comparison of transcriptomic data from the cellular model with laser-captured spinal motor neurons from C9ORF72-ALS cases, we also demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt cell survival signalling pathway is dysregulated in both systems. Furthermore, partial knockdown of Pten rescues the toxicity observed in the NSC34 (G4C2)102 cellular gain-of-toxic function model of C9ORF72-ALS. Our data indicate that PTEN may provide a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate toxic effects of the (G4C2)n repeat.	0
Frequency of c.35delG Mutation in GJB2 Gene (Connexin 26) in Syrian Patients with Nonsyndromic Hearing Impairment. ||  || Hearing impairments (HI) are the most common birth defect worldwide. Very large numbers of genes have been identified but the most profound is GJB2. The clinical interest regarding this gene is very pronounced due to its high carrier frequency (0.5-5.4%) across different ethnic groups. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of commonGJB2 mutations in Syrian patients with profound sensorineural HI. We carried out PCR, restriction enzyme based screening, and sequencing of 132 Syrian patients diagnosed clinically with hereditary deafness for different GJB2 mutations. The result revealed that, in GJB2 gene, c.35delG is the most prevalent among affected studied subjects (13.64%), followed by c.457G>A (2.4%). The benefit of this study on the one hand is its first report of prelingual deafness causative gene mutations identified by sequencing technology in the Syrian families. It is obvious from the results that the deployment in biomedical research is highly effective and has a great impact on the ability to uncover the cause of genetic variation in different genetic diseases.	4
Molecular etiology of hearing impairment in Inner Mongolia: mutations in SLC26A4 gene and relevant phenotype analysis. || Adolescent Age of Onset Amino Acid Sequence Child Child, Preschool China Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Ear, Inner Female Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Male Membrane Transport Proteins Molecular Sequence Data Phenotype Sequence Alignment Sulfate Transporters Syndrome Thyroid Gland Thyroid Hormones Young Adult || The molecular etiology of hearing impairment in Chinese has not been thoroughly investigated. Study of GJB2 gene revealed that 30.4% of the patients with hearing loss in Inner Mongolia carried GJB2 mutations. The SLC26A4 gene mutations and relevant phenotype are analyzed in this study. One hundred and thirty-five deaf patients were included. The coding exons of SLC26A4 gene were sequence analyzed in 111 patients, not including 22 patients carrying bi-allelic GJB2 mutations or one patient carrying a known GJB2 dominant mutation as well as one patient with mtDNA 1555A>G mutation. All patients with SLC26A4 mutations or variants were subjected to high resolution temporal bone CT scan and those with confirmed enlarged vestibular aqueduct and/or other inner ear malformation were then given further ultrasound scan of thyroid and thyroid hormone assays. Twenty-six patients (19.26%, 26/135) were found carrying SLC26A4 mutation. Among them, 17 patients with bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations were all confirmed to have EVA or other inner ear malformation by CT scan. Nine patients were heterozygous for one SLC26A4 mutation, including 3 confirmed to be EVA or EVA and Mondini dysplasia by CT scan. The most common mutation, IVS7-2A>G, accounted for 58.14% (25/43) of all SLC26A4 mutant alleles. The shape and function of thyroid were confirmed to be normal by thyroid ultrasound scan and thyroid hormone assays in 19 of the 20 patients with EVA or other inner ear malformation except one who had cystoid change in the right side of thyroid. No Pendred syndrome was diagnosed. In Inner Mongolia, China, mutations in SLC26A4 gene account for about 12.6% (17/135) of the patients with hearing loss. Together with GJB2 (23/135), SLC26A4 are the two most commonly mutated genes causing deafness in this region. Pendred syndrome is not detected in this deaf population. We established a new strategy that detects SLC26A4 mutations prior to the temporal bone CT scan to find EVA and inner ear malformation patients. This model has a unique advantage in epidemiologic study of large deaf population.	1
Modulation of gene expression in U251 glioblastoma cells by binding of mutant p53 R273H to intronic and intergenic sequences. || Binding Sites Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Chromatin Immunoprecipitation DNA, Intergenic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Genome, Human Glioblastoma Humans Introns Mutation, Missense Sequence Analysis, DNA Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Missense point mutations in the TP53 gene are frequent genetic alterations in human tumor tissue and cell lines derived thereof. Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins have lost sequence-specific DNA binding, but have retained the ability to interact in a structure-selective manner with non-B DNA and to act as regulators of transcription. To identify functional binding sites of mutp53, we established a small library of genomic sequences bound by p53(R273H) in U251 human glioblastoma cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Mutp53 binding to isolated DNA fragments confirmed the specificity of the ChIP. The mutp53 bound DNA sequences are rich in repetitive DNA elements, which are dispersed over non-coding DNA regions. Stable down-regulation of mutp53 expression strongly suggested that mutp53 binding to genomic DNA is functional. We identified the PPARGC1A and FRMD5 genes as p53(R273H) targets regulated by binding to intronic and intra-genic sequences. We propose a model that attributes the oncogenic functions of mutp53 to its ability to interact with intronic and intergenic non-B DNA sequences and modulate gene transcription via re-organization of chromatin.	0

[Genetic analysis of family constellation for cochlear implant recipients]. ||  || GJB2, SLC26A4 (PDS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with sensorineural hearing loss. In the present study, the clinical, genetic and molecular analysis of 14 cochlear implant recipients and their parents was studied from April 2006 to September 2007. Of the 14 subjects, 35.7% had gene mutations; 28.6% had homozygous GJB2 235delC mutation, whose parents carried heterozygous GJB2 235delC mutation; and 7.1% had mtDNA A1555G mutation, whose mother carried mtDNA A1555G mutation too. There was no SLC26A4 (PDS) mutation. These results strongly suggested that the mutation in GJB2 gene was a major cause of deafness in cochlear implant recipients and the mutation of mtDNA A1555G was another important cause. Genetic test of hot-spots and analysis of family constellation can offer an accurate genetic counseling to deaf family and reduce the incidence of hearing loss.	4
Dual expression of immunoreactive estrogen receptor β and p53 is a potential predictor of regional lymph node metastasis and postoperative recurrence in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Endometrioid Endometrial Neoplasms Estrogen Receptor beta Female Humans Lymphatic Metastasis Middle Aged Mutation Postoperative Period Recurrence Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Although histological grade and muscular invasion are related to the malignant behaviors of endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, lymphatic and/or distant metastases are unexpectedly encountered, even in patients in the low-risk group. To re-evaluate additional reliable parameters to predict the risk of progression, we examined the immunohistochemical expression profiles of p53 and estrogen receptor (ER) β proteins. Patients with endometrial endometrioid carcinoma who underwent surgical treatment at our hospital (n = 154) were recruited to this study, and the significance of the relationships between the incidence of regional lymph node metastasis and/or postoperative recurrence and clinical or experimental parameters was evaluated. By multivariate analysis, we found that histological grades, detection of immunoreactive p53 (positive rates more than 10%, p53-stained), and high expression of ERβ (high-ERβ) were independently associated with metastasis and/or recurrence. Among these parameters, the sensitivity and negative predictive values of high-ERβ were very high (up to 100%). In the population with high-ERβ, the positive rates of metastasis and/or recurrence were 61.1% in the p53-stained group and 21.9% in the p53-non-stained (negative) group. Furthermore, the positive rate in the group showing myometrial invasion of more than 1/2 and showing both p53-stained and high-ERβ was 80%. The disease-free survival of patients who were double-positive for p53-stained and high-ERβ was significantly shorter than that in other patients. In summary, our findings showed that increases in ERβ and p53 immunoreactivity were significantly correlated with the incidence of metastasis and/or recurrence in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, suggesting that double-positivity for p53-stained and high-ERβ may provide a promising clinical indicator to predict the risk of progression.	4
[The mutation spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in patients with phenylketonuria in Henan province]. ||  || To investigate the characteristics of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Henan province, China, in order for providing basic information for clinical genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. All the exons and partial flanking introns of the PAH gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bi-directional sequencing in 34 patients with PKU from Henan province. A total of 23 different disease-causing mutations were identified which corresponded to 92.65% (63/68) of the PAH alleles, including 12 missense mutations, 4 nonsense mutations, 4 splicing junction mutations, and 3 deletion mutations. Among them, A156P and P69_S70delinsP(delCTT) were novel mutations; IVS2+ 5G to C, G332E, IVS10-14C to G and L367 to Wfs were reported in Chinese population for the first time according to the PAH database (www.pahdb.mcgill.ca). Among all the 13 exons, exon 7 harbored the most type of mutations, exon 11 and exon 5 the second. The most common mutations included R243Q (17.65%, 12/68), V399V (11.76%, 8/68), IVS4-1G to A (8.82%, 6/68), R400T(7.35%, 5/68), Y166X(5.88%,4/68) and G247R(5.88%, 4/68). In addition, 9 other gene variations were found in this study. The mutation spectrum and frequency of the PAH gene of patients with phenylketonuria in Henan province were slightly different from those from other parts of China.	3
Extracellular-Regulated Kinases: Signaling From Ras to ERK Substrates to Control Biological Outcomes. ||  || The extracellular-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 are evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitous serine-threonine kinases that are involved in regulating cellular signaling in both normal and pathological conditions. Their expression is critical for development and their hyperactivation is a major factor in cancer development and progression. Since their discovery as one of the major signaling mediators activated by mitogens and Ras mutation, we have learned much about their regulation, including their activation, binding partners and substrates. In this review I will discuss some of what has been discovered about the members of the Ras to ERK pathway, including regulation of their activation by growth factors and cell adhesion pathways. Looking downstream of ERK activation I will also highlight some of the many ERK substrates that have been discovered, including those involved in feedback regulation, cell migration and cell cycle progression through the control of transcription, pre-mRNA splicing and protein synthesis.	0

Racial differences in endometrial cancer molecular portraits in The Cancer Genome Atlas. ||  || Endometrial cancer (EC) is now the most prevalent gynaecological malignancy in the Western world. Black or African American women (BoAA) have double the mortality of Caucasian women, and their tumours tend to be of higher grade. Despite these disparities, little is known regarding the mutational landscape of EC between races. Hence, we wished to investigate the molecular features of ECs within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset by racial groupings. In total 374 Caucasian, 109 BoAA and 20 Asian patients were included in the analysis. Asian women were diagnosed at younger age, 54.2 years versus 64.5 years for Caucasian and 64.9 years for BoAA women (OR 3.432; p=0.011); BoAA women were more likely to have serous type tumors (OR 2.061; p=0.008). No difference in overall survival was evident. The most frequently mutated gene in Caucasian and Asian tumours was PTEN (63% and 85%), unlike BoAA cases where it wasTP53 (49%). Mutation and somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) analysis revealed an enrichment ofTP53 mutations in BoAAs; whereasPOLE andRPL22 mutations were more frequent in Caucasians. Major recurrent SCNA racial differences were observed at chromosomes 3p, 8, 10, and 16, which clustered BoAA tumors into 4 distinct groups and Caucasian tumors into 5 groups. There was a significantly higher frequency of somatic mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes in Asian tumours, in particularPMS2 (p=0.0036). In conclusion, inherent racial disparities appear to be present in the molecular profile of EC, which could have potential implications on clinical management.	4
Pharmacological activation of p53 in cancer cells. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Genes, p53 Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that regulates a large number of genes and guards against genomic instability. Under multiple cellular stress conditions, p53 functions to block cell cycle progression transiently unless proper DNA repair occurs. Failure of DNA repair mechanisms leads to p53-mediated induction of cell death programs. p53 also induces permanent cell cycle arrest known as cellular senescence. During neoplastic progression, p53 is often mutated and fails to efficiently perform these functions. It has been observed that cancers carrying a wild-type p53 may also have interrupted downstream p53 regulatory signaling leading to disruption in p53 functions. Therefore, strategies to reactivate p53 provide an attractive approach for blocking tumor pathogenesis and its progression. p53 activation may also lead to regression of existing early neoplastic lesions and therefore may be important in developing cancer chemoprevention protocols. A large number of small molecules capable of reactivating p53 have been developed and some are progressing through clinical trials for prospective human applications. However, several questions remain to be answered at this stage. For example, it is not certain if pharmacological activation of p53 will restore all of its multifaceted biological responses, assuming that the targeted cell is not killed following p53 activation. It remains to be demonstrated whether the distinct biological effects regulated by specific post-translationally modified p53 can effectively be restored by refolding mutant p53. Mutant p53 can be classified as a loss-of-function or gain-of-function protein depending on the type of mutation. It is also unclear whether reactivation of mutant p53 has similar consequences in cells carrying gain-of-function and loss-of-function p53 mutants. This review provides a description of various pharmacological approaches tested to activate p53 (both wild-type and mutant) and to assess the effects of activated p53 on neoplastic progression.	0
Soy isoflavones and prostate cancer: a review of molecular mechanisms. || Angiogenesis Inhibitors Animals Antioxidants Apoptosis Autophagy Cell Cycle Cell Differentiation DNA Repair Epigenesis, Genetic Humans Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Isoflavones Male MicroRNAs Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplastic Stem Cells Prostaglandins Prostatic Neoplasms Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Radiation-Sensitizing Agents Receptors, Androgen Receptors, Estrogen Signal Transduction Soybeans Transforming Growth Factor beta Wnt Signaling Pathway || Soy isoflavones are dietary components for which an association has been demonstrated with reduced risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in Asian populations. However, the exact mechanism by which these isoflavones may prevent the development or progression of PCa is not completely understood. There are a growing number of animal and in vitro studies that have attempted to elucidate these mechanisms. The predominant and most biologically active isoflavones in soy products, genistein, daidzein, equol, and glycetin, inhibit prostate carcinogenesis in some animal models. Cell-based studies show that soy isoflavones regulate genes that control cell cycle and apoptosis. In this review, we discuss the literature relevant to the molecular events that may account for the benefit of soy isoflavones in PCa prevention or treatment. These reports show that although soy isoflavone-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of PCa cells are plausible mechanisms, other chemo protective mechanisms are also worthy of consideration. These possible mechanisms include antioxidant defense, DNA repair, inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis, potentiation of radio- and chemotherapeutic agents, and antagonism of estrogen- and androgen-mediated signaling pathways. Moreover, other cells in the cancer milieu, such as the fibroblastic stromal cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells, may be targeted by soy isoflavones, which may contribute to soy-mediated prostate cancer prevention. In this review, these mechanisms are discussed along with considerations about the doses and the preclinical models that have been used.	0

Cross-sectional study nested in a cohort. Were analyzed 37 patients with indeterminate etiology for deafness that underwent to cochlear implant. DNA was extracted and the mutations were studied using Polymerase Chain Reaction followed by gene sequencing. The prevalence of 35delG mutation was 11%. The speech recognition index was 72% in the group with 35delG mutation, and 30% in the group without this mutation (p>0.05). Prevalence of 35delG mutation in this study confirmed findings in the Brazilian literature. There was a clinically significant difference in hearing performance in patients with 35delG. Absence of statistical significance in this result might be attributed to the small number of patients with 35delG in our sample.	4
A new mutation found in newborn screening for Fabry disease evaluated by plasma globotriaosylsphingosine levels. ||  || A pilot study of newborn screening for Fabry disease was performed in Okinawa, Japan. A total of 2,443 neonates were screened using dried blood spot samples over 7 years starting in 2007. Of 13 neonates determined to have low α-galactosidase A (GLA) activity, one boy had a new missense mutation, p.G144D of the GLA gene. This mutation was considered to be a late-onset type, as evaluated based on plasma globotriaosylsphingosine levels and family history.	4
Standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants: a joint consensus recommendation of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. || Case-Control Studies Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Genetic Variation Humans Mutation Odds Ratio Sequence Analysis, DNA || The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence variants.(1) In the past decade, sequencing technology has evolved rapidly with the advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology-"pathogenic," "likely pathogenic," "uncertain significance," "likely benign," and "benign"-to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.	4
Involvement of p53 in the repair of DNA double strand breaks: multifaceted Roles of p53 in homologous recombination repair (HRR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). || DNA Damage DNA End-Joining Repair Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Recombinational DNA Repair || p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that prevents oncogenic transformation and maintains genomic stability by blocking proliferation of cells harboring unrepaired or misrepaired DNA. A wide range of genotoxic stresses such as DNA damaging anti-cancer drugs and ionizing radiation promote nuclear accumulation of p53 and trigger its ability to activate or repress a number of downstream target genes involved in various signaling pathways. This cascade leads to the activation of multiple cell cycle checkpoints and subsequent cell cycle arrest, allowing the cells to either repair the DNA or undergo apoptosis, depending on the intensity of DNA damage. In addition, p53 has many transcription-independent functions, including modulatory roles in DNA repair and recombination. This chapter will focus on the role of p53 in regulating or influencing the repair of DNA double-strand breaks that mainly includes homologous recombination repair (HRR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Through this discussion, we will try to establish that p53 acts as an important linchpin between upstream DNA damage signaling cues and downstream cellular events that include repair, recombination, and apoptosis.	0
Next-generation sequencing of adrenocortical carcinoma reveals new routes to targeted therapies. || Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms Adrenocortical Carcinoma Adult Aged Antineoplastic Agents Biomarkers, Tumor Biopsy Drug Design Female Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Patient Selection Precision Medicine Predictive Value of Tests Retrospective Studies Signal Transduction Young Adult || Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) carries a poor prognosis and current systemic cytotoxic therapies result in only modest improvement in overall survival. In this retrospective study, we performed a comprehensive genomic profiling of 29 consecutive ACC samples to identify potential targets of therapy not currently searched for in routine clinical practice. DNA from 29 ACC was sequenced to high, uniform coverage (Illumina HiSeq) and analysed for genomic alterations (GAs). At least one GA was found in 22 (76%) ACC (mean 2.6 alterations per ACC). The most frequent GAs were in TP53 (34%), NF1 (14%), CDKN2A (14%), MEN1 (14%), CTNNB1 (10%) and ATM (10%). APC, CCND2, CDK4, DAXX, DNMT3A, KDM5C, LRP1B, MSH2 and RB1 were each altered in two cases (7%) and EGFR, ERBB4, KRAS, MDM2, NRAS, PDGFRB, PIK3CA, PTEN and PTCH1 were each altered in a single case (3%). In 17 (59%) of ACC, at least one GA was associated with an available therapeutic or a mechanism-based clinical trial. Next-generation sequencing can discover targets of therapy for relapsed and metastatic ACC and shows promise to improve outcomes for this aggressive form of cancer.	4
Pediatric Cardiomyopathies. || Age of Onset Cardiac Imaging Techniques Cardiomyopathies Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Incidence Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Mutation Myocardium Phenotype Prognosis Risk Factors Ventricular Function || Pediatric cardiomyopathies are rare diseases with an annual incidence of 1.1 to 1.5 per 100 000. Dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are the most common; restrictive, noncompaction, and mixed cardiomyopathies occur infrequently; and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is rare. Pediatric cardiomyopathies can result from coronary artery abnormalities, tachyarrhythmias, exposure to infection or toxins, or secondary to other underlying disorders. Increasingly, the importance of genetic mutations in the pathogenesis of isolated or syndromic pediatric cardiomyopathies is becoming apparent. Pediatric cardiomyopathies often occur in the absence of comorbidities, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, renal dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus; as a result, they offer insights into the primary pathogenesis of myocardial dysfunction. Large international registries have characterized the epidemiology, cause, and outcomes of pediatric cardiomyopathies. Although adult and pediatric cardiomyopathies have similar morphological and clinical manifestations, their outcomes differ significantly. Within 2 years of presentation, normalization of function occurs in 20% of children with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 40% die or undergo transplantation. Infants with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have a 2-year mortality of 30%, whereas death is rare in older children. Sudden death is rare. Molecular evidence indicates that gene expression differs between adult and pediatric cardiomyopathies, suggesting that treatment response may differ as well. Clinical trials to support evidence-based treatments and the development of disease-specific therapies for pediatric cardiomyopathies are in their infancy. This compendium summarizes current knowledge of the genetic and molecular origins, clinical course, and outcomes of the most common phenotypic presentations of pediatric cardiomyopathies and highlights key areas where additional research is required.

Transcriptional activation of p53 by Pitx1. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Division Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cytokines DNA Genes, p53 Growth Differentiation Factor 15 Humans Mutation Paired Box Transcription Factors Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Transfection Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || Little is known about factors that stimulate transcription of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Here, we report that the human pituitary homeobox 1 (hPitx1) transcription factor increases the expression of p53 at the mRNA and protein levels in human mammary carcinoma (MCF-7) cells. Increased p53 mRNA expression was due to activation of the p53 promoter by hPitx1. hPitx1 bound directly to the p53 promoter and functionally utilized two hPitx1 consensus elements. The predominant consensus element utilized by hPitx1 to stimulate p53 transcription was located within the first exon of the p53 gene. A hPitx1 mutant (hPitx1-R141P) acting as a dominant inhibitor repressed p53 transcription. Forced expression of hPitx1 resulted in cell-cycle arrest and p53-dependent apoptosis in p53-replete MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, hPitx1 stimulated the transcription of p53 target genes involved in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (p21 and PTGF-beta), again in a p53-dependent manner. Depletion of endogenous hPitx1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in MCF-7 cells resulted in decreased basal expression of p53 and consequently of p21 and placental transforming growth factor beta (PTGF-beta). Depletion of p53 by siRNA dramatically attenuated hPitx1-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Thus, p53 is a direct transcriptional target gene of hPitx1. This observation is concordant with the recent identification of hPitx1 as a tumor suppressor gene.	0
Targeted next-generation sequencing of cancer genes in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. || endocrine cancers rare diseases syndromes thyroid || Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) is a rare malignancy with higher mortality than well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The histological diagnosis can be difficult as well as the therapy. Improved diagnosis and new targeted therapies require knowledge of DNA sequence changes in cancer-relevant genes. The TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel was used to screen cancer genomes from 25 PDTC patients for somatic single-nucleotide variants in 48 genes known to represent mutational hotspots. A total of 4490 variants were found in 23 tissue samples of PDTC. Ninety-eight percent (4392) of these variants did not meet the inclusion criteria, while 98 potentially pathogenic or pathogenic variants remained after filtering. These variants were distributed over 33 genes and were all present in a heterozygous state. Five tissue samples harboured not a single variant. Predominantly, variants in <i>P53</i> (43% of tissue samples) were identified, while less frequently, variants in <i>APC</i>, <i>ERBB4</i>, <i>FLT3</i>, <i>KIT</i>, <i>SMAD4</i> and <i>BRAF</i> (each in 17% of tissue samples) as well as <i>ATM</i>, <i>EGFR</i> and <i>FBXW7</i> (each in 13% of tissue samples) were observed. This study identified new potential genetic targets for further research in PDTC. Of particular interest are four observed <i>ERBB4</i> (alias <i>HER4</i>) variants, which have not been connected to this type of thyroid carcinoma so far. In addition, <i>APC</i> and <i>SMAD4</i> mutations have not been reported in this subtype of cancer either. In contrast to other reports, we did not find <i>CTNNB1</i> variants.	4
SUMO1 negatively regulates BRCA1-mediated transcription, via modulation of promoter occupancy. || BRCA1 Protein Binding Sites Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line DNA Damage Down-Regulation Histone Deacetylases Histones Humans Nuclear Proteins Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA Interference SUMO-1 Protein Transcriptional Activation Two-Hybrid System Techniques || BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene, is implicated in the repression and activation of transcription via interactions with a diverse range of proteins. The mechanisms regulating the action of BRCA1 are not fully understood. Here, we use the promoters of Gadd45alpha, p27(KIP1) and p21(WAF1/CIP1) to demonstrate that SUMO1 represses transactivation potential of BRCA1 by causing BRCA1 to be released from the promoters and augmenting histone deacetylation via recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Consistently, silencing of SUMO1 led to recruitment of BRCA1 and release of HDAC1 at the BRCA1 target promoters, and subsequent transcriptional activation of the BRCA1 target genes. Furthermore, a sumoylation-incompetent mutant missing the sumoylation donor site suppressed BRCA1-induced activation of transcription, whereas E2 UBC9 or the dominant-negative mutant UBC9 had no effect, implying that repression of BRCA1-mediated activation of transcription by SUMO1 is independent of sumoylation. Repression of BRCA1-mediated activation of transcription by SUMO1 was reversed by DNA damage by inducing the release of SUMO1 from the Gadd45alpha promoter and the recruitment of BRCA1, along with increased histone acetylation, to enhance activation of transcription. Together, our data provide evidence that SUMO1 plays a role in the activation-repression switch of BRCA1-mediated transcription via modulation of promoter occupancy.	0
The first USH2A mutation analysis of Japanese autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa patients: a totally different mutation profile with the lack of frequent mutations found in Caucasian patients. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group DNA Mutational Analysis European Continental Ancestry Group Exons Extracellular Matrix Proteins Family Health Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genotype Humans Japan Male Mutation Pedigree Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Retinitis Pigmentosa Usher Syndromes || Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disease. The USH2A gene, which accounts for approximately 74-90% of Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2) cases, is also one of the major autosomal recessive RP (arRP) causative genes among Caucasian populations. To identify disease-causing USH2A gene mutations in Japanese RP patients, all 73 exons were screened for mutations by direct sequencing. In total, 100 unrelated Japanese RP patients with no systemic manifestations were identified, excluding families with obvious autosomal dominant inheritance. Of these 100 patients, 82 were included in this present study after 18 RP patients with very likely pathogenic EYS (eyes shut homolog) mutations were excluded. The mutation analysis of the USH2A revealed five very likely pathogenic mutations in four patients. A patient had only one very likely pathogenic mutation and the others had two of them. Caucasian frequent mutations p.C759F in arRP and p.E767fs in USH2 were not found. All the four patients exhibited typical clinical features of RP. The observed prevalence of USH2A gene mutations was approximately 4% among Japanese arRP patients, and the profile of the USH2A gene mutations differed largely between Japanese patients and previously reported Caucasian populations.	1
Amino acid 572 in TMC1: hot spot or critical functional residue for dominant mutations causing hearing impairment. || Amino Acids Chromosome Segregation Family Female Genes, Dominant Haplotypes Hearing Loss Humans Male Membrane Proteins Microsatellite Repeats Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || Two different missense mutations, p.D572N and p.D572H, affecting the same nucleotide and codon of the TMC1 gene were earlier reported to cause autosomal dominant hearing impairment at locus DFNA36 in two North American families. No other dominant mutations of human TMC1 have been published. We ascertained a third North American family segregating autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment at the DFNA36 locus. We identified the p.D572N mutation of TMC1 co-segregating with hearing loss in our study family. A comparative haplotype analysis of linked single nucleotide polymorphisms and short tandem repeats in the two families segregating p.D572N was not consistent with a founder effect. These findings can be explained in two ways. Either nucleotide 1714 is a hot spot for mutations or, alternatively, missense mutations at this site confer a specific pathogenic gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect.	4
[Tonal audiometry of GJB2 235delC single heterozygous mutation carriers]. || Adult Aged Audiometry, Pure-Tone Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genotype Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation || To analyze GJB2 235delC monoallelic mutation carrier individuals and test the possible presence and incidence of audiometric abnormalities among 30-60 years old carriers of the 235delC mutations. A total of 32 unrelated subjects with nonsyndromic hearing loss were screened for the 235delC mutation. Tonal audiometric analysis was performed on the 235delC mutation carrier group and on a non-carrier control group. Audiometric evaluations in the control group showed the presence of thresholds within normal limits at all frequencies, while carriers of the 235delC mutation presented with decreased hearing at 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz (age 40-49 years and 50-59 years), and 4000 and 8000 Hz (age 30-59 years), P < 0.05. The hearing loss of carriers gradually increased with age. GJB2 235delC heterozygous carriers may be a risk group for high-frequency hearing loss. Hearing thresholds may deteriorate in the intermediate frequencies over the age of 40.	4

Oligomerization of BAK by p53 utilizes conserved residues of the p53 DNA binding domain. || Animals Apoptosis Caenorhabditis elegans Cell Line, Tumor Fibroblasts Humans Mice Mitochondria Models, Biological Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Structure, Tertiary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein || Genotoxic stress triggers a rapid translocation of p53 to the mitochondria, contributing to apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner. Using immunopurification protocols and mass spectrometry, we previously identified the proapoptotic protein BAK as a mitochondrial p53-binding protein and showed that recombinant p53 directly binds to BAK and can induce its oligomerization, leading to cytochrome c release. In this work we describe a combination of molecular modeling, electrostatic analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis to define contact residues between BAK and p53. Our data indicate that three regions within the core DNA binding domain of p53 make contact with BAK; these are the conserved H2 alpha-helix and the L1 and L3 loop. Notably, point mutations in these regions markedly impair the ability of p53 to oligomerize BAK and to induce transcription-independent cell death. We present a model whereby positively charged residues within the H2 helix and L1 loop of p53 interact with an electronegative domain on the N-terminal alpha-helix of BAK; the latter is known to undergo conformational changes upon BAK activation. We show that mutation of acidic residues in the N-terminal helix impair the ability of BAK to bind to p53. Interestingly, many of the p53 contact residues predicted by our model are also direct DNA contact residues, suggesting that p53 interacts with BAK in a manner analogous to DNA. The combined data point to the H2 helix and L1 and L3 loops of p53 as novel functional domains contributing to transcription-independent apoptosis by this tumor suppressor protein.	0
Mutant p53: "gain of function" through perturbation of nuclear structure and function? ||  || Mutant p53 not simply is an inactivated tumor suppressor, as at least some mutant p53 proteins exhibit oncogenic properties. Mutant p53 thus is the most commonly expressed oncogene in human cancer. Accordingly, the expression of mutant p53 in tumors often correlates with bad prognosis, and expression of mutant p53 in p53-negative tumor cells enhances their transformed phenotype. The molecular basis for this "gain of function" is not yet understood. However, the finding that mutant p53 tightly associates with the nuclear matrix in vivo, and with high affinity binds to nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR) DNA in vitro, suggests that these activities are connected and may result in perturbation of nuclear structure and function in tumor cells. MAR-binding of mutant p53 most likely is due to conformation-selective DNA binding by mutant p53, i.e. the specific interaction of a given mutant p53 protein with regulatory or structural genomic DNA elements that are able to adopt specific non-B-DNA conformations. In support to this assumption, human mutant p53 (Gly(245)-->Ser) was shown to bind to repetitive DNA elements in vivo that might be part of MAR elements. This further supports a model according to which mutant p53, by interacting with key structural components of the nucleus, exerts its oncogenic activities through perturbation of nuclear structure and function.

Synergistic Rescue of Nonsense Mutant Tumor Suppressor p53 by Combination Treatment with Aminoglycosides and Mdm2 Inhibitors. ||  || The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is inactivated by mutation in a large fraction of human tumors. Around 10% ofTP53 mutations are nonsense mutations that lead to premature termination of translation and expression of truncated unstable and non-functional p53 protein. Aminoglycosides G418 (geneticin) and gentamicin have been shown to induce translational readthrough and expression of full-length p53. However, aminoglycosides have severe side effects that limit their clinical use. Here, we show that combination treatment with a proteasome inhibitor or compounds that disrupt p53-Mdm2 binding can synergistically enhance levels of full-length p53 upon aminoglycoside-induced readthrough of R213X nonsense mutant p53. Full-length p53 expressed upon combination treatment is functionally active as assessed by upregulation of p53 target genes, suppression of cell growth, and induction of cell death. Thus, our results demonstrate that combination treatment with aminoglycosides and compounds that inhibit p53 degradation is synergistic and can provide significantly improved efficacy of readthrough when compared with aminoglycosides alone. This may have implications for future cancer therapy based on reactivation of nonsense mutantTP53.	0
Genetic basis of calcifying cystic odontogenic tumors. || Adolescent Adult Aged Ameloblastoma Blotting, Western Child DNA, Neoplasm Female HEK293 Cells High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Jaw Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Odontogenic Cyst, Calcifying Polymerase Chain Reaction Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Young Adult beta Catenin || Calcifying cystic odontogenic tumors (CCOTs) are benign cystic tumors that form abnormally keratinized ghost cells. Mutations in CTNNB1, which encodes beta-catenin, have been implicated in the development of these tumors, but a causal relationship has not been definitively established. Thus, mutational hot spots in 50 cancer genes were examined by targeted next-generation sequencing in 11 samples of CCOT. Mutations in CTNNB1, but not in other genes, were observed in 10 of 11 cases. These mutations constitutively activate beta-catenin signaling by abolishing the phosphorylation sites Asp32, Ser33, or Ser37, and are similar to those reported in pilomatrixoma and adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. In contrast, BRAF or NRAS mutations were observed in 12 and two control samples of ameloblastoma, respectively. In HEK293 cells, overexpression of mutated CTNNB1 also upregulated hair keratin, a marker of ghost cells. Furthermore, ghost cells were present in two cases of ameloblastoma with BRAF and CTNNB1 mutations, indicating that ghost cells form due to mutations in CTNNB1. The data suggest that mutations in CTNNB1 are the major driver mutations of CCOT, and that CCOT is the genetic analog of pilomatrixoma and adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma in odontogenic tissue.	4
MYBPC3 mutations are associated with a reduced super-relaxed state in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Female Genotyping Techniques Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle Relaxation Mutation Myocardial Contraction Myocytes, Cardiac Myosins Young Adult || The "super-relaxed state" (SRX) of myosin represents a 'reserve' of motors in the heart. Myosin heads in the SRX are bound to the thick filament and have a very low ATPase rate. Changes in the SRX are likely to modulate cardiac contractility. We previously demonstrated that the SRX is significantly reduced in mouse cardiomyocytes lacking cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). Here, we report the effect of mutations in the cMyBP-C gene (MYBPC3) using samples from human patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Left ventricular (LV) samples from 11 HCM patients were obtained following myectomy surgery to relieve LV outflow tract obstruction. HCM samples were genotyped as either MYBPC3 mutation positive (MYBPC3mut) or negative (HCMsmn) and were compared to eight non-failing donor hearts. Compared to donors, only MYBPC3mut samples display a significantly diminished SRX, characterised by a decrease in both the number of myosin heads in the SRX and the lifetime of ATP turnover. These changes were not observed in HCMsmn samples. There was a positive correlation (p < 0.01) between the expression of cMyBP-C and the proportion of myosin heads in the SRX state, suggesting cMyBP-C modulates and maintains the SRX. Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain in MYBPC3mut samples was significantly decreased compared to the other groups, suggesting a potential mechanism to compensate for the diminished SRX. We conclude that by altering both contractility and sarcomeric energy requirements, a reduced SRX may be an important disease mechanism in patients with MYBPC3 mutations.	4
Preleukemic and second-hit mutational events in an acute myeloid leukemia patient with a novel germline RUNX1 mutation. ||  || Germline mutations in the RUNX1 transcription factor give rise to a rare autosomal dominant genetic condition classified under the entity: Familial Platelet Disorders with predisposition to Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (FPD/AML). While several studies have identified a myriad of germline RUNX1 mutations implicated in this disorder, second-hit mutational events are necessary for patients with hereditary thrombocytopenia to develop full-blown AML. The molecular picture behind this process remains unclear. We describe a patient of Malay descent with an unreported 7-bp germlineRUNX1 frameshift deletion, who developed second-hit mutations that could have brought about the leukaemic transformation from a pre-leukaemic state. These mutations were charted through the course of the treatment and stem cell transplant, showing a clear correlation between her clinical presentation and the mutations present. The patient was a 27-year-old Malay woman who presented with AML on the background of hereditary thrombocytopenia affecting her father and 3 brothers. Initial molecular testing revealed the same novel RUNX1 mutation in all 5 individuals. The patient received standard induction, consolidation chemotherapy, and a haploidentical stem cell transplant from her mother with normalRUNX1 profile. Comprehensive genomic analyses were performed at diagnosis, post-chemotherapy and post-transplant. A total of 8 mutations (RUNX1,GATA2,DNMT3A,BCORL1,BCOR, 2PHF6 andCDKN2A) were identified in the pre-induction sample, of which 5 remained (RUNX1,DNMT3A,BCORL1,BCOR and 1 out of 2PHF6) in the post-treatment sample and none were present post-transplant. In brief, the 3 mutations which were lost along with the leukemic cells at complete morphological remission were most likely acquired leukemic driver mutations that were responsible for the AML transformation from a pre-leukemic germlineRUNX1-mutated state. On the contrary, the 5 mutations that persisted post-treatment, including the germlineRUNX1 mutation, were likely to be part of the preleukemic clone. Further studies are necessary to assess the prevalence of these preleukemic and secondary mutations in the larger FPD/AML patient cohort and establish their prognostic significance. Given the molecular heterogeneity of FPD/AML and other AML subtypes, a better understanding of mutational classes and their involvement in AML pathogenesis can improve risk stratification of patients for more effective and targeted therapy.	4
Mutation or loss of p53 differentially modifies TGFβ action in ovarian cancer. ||  || Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological disease affecting women in the US. The Cancer Genome Atlas Network identified p53 mutations in 96% of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas, demonstrating its critical role. Additionally, the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) pathway is dysfunctional in various malignancies, including ovarian cancer. This study investigated how expression of wild-type, mutant, or the absence of p53 alters ovarian cancer cell response to TGFβ signaling, as well as the response of the ovarian surface epithelium and the fallopian tube epithelium to TGFβ. Only ovarian cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 were growth inhibited by TGFβ, while ovarian cancer cells that were mutant or null p53 were not. TGFβ induced migration in p53 null SKOV3 cells, which was not observed in SKOV3 cells with stable expression of mutant p53 R273H. Knockdown of wild-type p53 in the OVCA 420 ovarian cancer cells enhanced cell migration in response to TGFβ. Increased protein expression of DKK1 and TMEPAI, two pro-invasive genes with enhanced expression in late stage metastatic ovarian cancer, was observed in p53 knockdown and null cells, while cells stably expressing mutant p53 demonstrated lower DKK1 and TMEPAI induction. Expression of mutant p53 or loss of p53 permit continued proliferation of ovarian cancer cell lines in the presence of TGFβ; however, cells expressing mutant p53 exhibit reduced migration and decreased protein levels of DKK1 and TMEPAI.	0
Mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in Iranian Azeri Turkish patients with phenylketonuria. || Alleles DNA Mutational Analysis Ethnic Groups Exons Gene Frequency Genotype Humans Introns Iran Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Turkey || Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is caused by mutations in the PAH gene resulting in a primary deficiency of the PAH enzyme activity, intolerance to the dietary intake of phenylalanine (Phe), and production of the phenylketonuria disease. To date there have been no reports on the molecular analysis of phenylketonuria in the Iranian Azeri Turkish population. In this study, a total of 88 independent alleles from this ethnic group were investigated. Thirteen different mutations have been detected, which account for 75% of the total mutant alleles. Two mutations were found at high frequencies: IVS10-11G>A (19.3%) and P281L (19.3%), possibly due to consanguinity and genetic drift, among other factors. The frequencies of the other mutations were c.590_612del (5.7%), R261Q (5.7%), R261X (4.5%), R243X (4.5%), IVS2+5G>C (3.4%), IVS4+1G>A (3.4%), R158Q (2.3%), E280K (2.3%), G247D (2.3%), IVS11+1G>C (1.1%), and R270K (1.1%). These intriguing preliminary findings confirm IVS10-11G>A as a major mutation among Mediterranean mutations. For this population, exons 7 and 11 and adjacent introns, which carry more than 75% of the mutations, would have to be primarily screened. However, the other exons must be studied when either one or no mutations are found in the primary screening. The mutation spectrum in the patients with Azeri Turkish ethnic origin differed from that observed in patients from other Mediterranean countries and further defined the molecular heterogeneity of this disease.	1 3

p53 SUMOylation promotes its nuclear export by facilitating its release from the nuclear export receptor CRM1. || Active Transport, Cell Nucleus Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus Cytoplasm Humans Karyopherins Nuclear Export Signals Phylogeny Protein Multimerization Protein Structure, Tertiary Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Sequence Alignment Sumoylation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin || Chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1) mediates p53 nuclear export. Although p53 SUMOylation promotes its nuclear export, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we show that tethering of a small, ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) moiety to p53 markedly increases its cytoplasmic localization. SUMO attachment to p53 does not affect its oligomerization, suggesting that subunit dissociation required for exposing p53's nuclear export signal (NES) is unnecessary for p53 nuclear export. Surprisingly, SUMO-mediated p53 nuclear export depends on the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM)-binding pocket of SUMO-1. The CRM1 C-terminal domain lacking the NES-binding groove interacts with tetrameric p53, and the proper folding of the p53 core domain, rather than the presence of the N- or C-terminal tails, appears to be important for p53-CRM1 interaction. The CRM1 Huntington, EF3, a subunit of PP2A, and TOR1 9 (HEAT9) loop, which regulates GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran binding and cargo release, contains a prototypical SIM. Remarkably, disruption of this SIM in conjunction with a mutated SIM-binding groove of SUMO-1 markedly enhances the binding of CRM1 to p53-SUMO-1 and their accumulation in the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), as well as their persistent association in the cytoplasm. We propose that SUMOylation of a CRM1 cargo such as p53 at the NPCs unlocks the HEAT9 loop of CRM1 to facilitate the disassembly of the transporting complex and cargo release to the cytoplasm.	0
Dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation makes malignant melanoma cells addicted to glycolysis driven by the (V600E)BRAF oncogene. || Apoptosis Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glycolysis Humans Melanoma Mitochondria Oncogenes Oxidative Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Signal Transduction Transfection || Oncogene addiction describes how cancer cells exhibit dependence on single oncogenes to escape apoptosis and senescence. While oncogene addiction constitutes the basis for new cancer treatment strategies targeting individual kinases and pathways activated by oncogenic mutations, the biochemical basis for this addiction is largely unknown. Here we provide evidence for a metabolic rationale behind the addiction to (V600E)BRAF in two malignant melanoma cell lines. Both cell lines display a striking addiction to glycolysis due to underlying dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Notably, even minor reductions in glycolytic activity lead to increased OXPHOS activity (reversed Warburg effect), however the mitochondria are unable to sustain ATP production. We show that (V600E)BRAF upholds the activity of glycolysis and therefore the addiction to glycolysis de facto becomes an addiction to (V600E)BRAF. Finally, the senescence response associated with inhibition of (V600E)BRAF is rescued by overexpression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), providing direct evidence that oncogene addiction rests on a metabolic foundation.	0
Mutation analysis in hyperphenylalaninemia patients from South Italy. || DNA Mutational Analysis Genotype Humans Infant, Newborn Italy Mutation Neonatal Screening Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || Mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, EC 1.14.16.1) are associated with various degrees of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), including classical phenylketonuria (PKU). The aim of the study was to determine the mutations responsible for mild forms of HPA and to relate different clinical phenotypes of HPA patients to their PAH genotypes in order to better predict the clinical phenotype and implement optimal dietary therapy and prognosis in newborns with the disease. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations have been analyzed by direct DNA sequencing in 30 HPA patients (Phe levels ranging from 2 to 6mg/dL) from Southern Italy who were identified in a neonatal screening program and a genotype-phenotype correlation was performed. PAH gene mutation was identified in 39 out of 60 alleles with a mutation detection rate of 65%. Eighteen mutations, 2 undescribed, were observed (13 missense mutations, 1 deletion, 4 splice site mutations). Using the "in vitro" predicted residual activity, a good genotype-phenotype correlation was obtained also in a new mild HPA case, a PAH compound heterozygote, previously undetected. A marked genetic heterogeneity was found in HPA patients from Southern Italy and a good genotype-phenotype correlation was obtained. Identification of PAH gene mutations responsible for PAH deficiency will therefore be useful in the prediction of biochemical and clinical phenotypes in HPA patients.	1 3
Mutation status among patients with sinonasal mucosal melanoma and its impact on survival. || Aged DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Disease-Free Survival Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mucous Membrane Mutation Rate Nasal Cavity Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Retrospective Studies Survival Rate Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) comprises <1% of all melanomas and lacks well-characterised molecular markers. Our aim was to determine the frequencies of common mutations and examine their utility as molecular markers in a large series of primary SNMMs. SNMM patients seen at our institution from August 1991 through July 2016 were identified. Genomic DNA was extracted from 66 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumours and screened for mutations by direct sequencing. We investigated the association of mutations with clinicopathological features and survival outcomes. Overall, 41% (27 out of 66) of the SNMMs harboured mutations. BRAF and KIT mutations were identified in 8% (five patients) and 5% (three patients) of SNMMs, respectively, whereas NRAS mutations were detected in 30% (20 patients) of SNMMs. Mutation rates in these oncogenes were similar between SNMMs located in the paranasal sinuses and those in the nasal cavity (30% and 13%, respectively, P=0.09). In a multivariate analysis, patients with negative margins had significantly better overall survival (hazard ratio 5.43, 95% confidence interval 1.44-21.85, P=0.01) and disease-specific survival (hazard ratio 21.9, 95% confidence interval 3.71-180, P=0.0004). The mutation status of the tumours showed no association with survival outcomes. In SNNM, mutation status does not affect survival outcomes, but NRAS mutations are relatively frequent and could be targeted in this disease by MEK inhibitors.	4
First-trimester prenatal screening for the common 35delG GJB2 mutation causing prelingual deafness. ||  || This study evaluates the prevalence of 35delG GJB2 mutation, the most common genetic mutation causing prelingual deafness, and its screening feasibility and acceptability in pregnant women undergoing first-trimester CVS for chromosomal abnormality investigation. Samples were taken from 5786 pregnant women who requested CVS for chromosomal analysis. The samples were split into two aliquots for chromosome and DNA analysis, respectively. The results of foetal karyotyping were provided 7 days after sampling, at which time the fully informed couple decided whether or not to undergo DNA testing. Of the 5449 eligible candidates, 2997 (55.0%) chose to undergo 35delG testing. Among them, 67 proved to be carriers of the mutation, resulting in a prevalence rate of 1:44.7 (2.23%). There were no homozygous foetuses, but two double heterozygous foetuses were found, and in one case the couple chose to terminate the pregnancy. The results confirm the high frequency of 35delG mutation in the Italian population. The study shows that prenatal screening for GJB2 mutations in pregnant women with no retrospective risk for deafness appears to be feasible and highly acceptable. Consequently, given evidence that early evaluation and treatment significantly improve speech and language skills, as well as social and emotional well-being in affected children, 35delG mutation analysis in pregnant women booking CVS primarily for chromosomal investigation could be considered a useful addition to more comprehensive population screening strategies.	4

Patients with ACC who underwent potential curative surgery at the authors' department were screened for TP53 somatic and germline mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 by DHPLC analysis. Aberrant samples were further analyzed by direct sequencing. Immunostaining was performed on corresponding paraffin sections in all patients. Complete clinical and follow-up data were correlated with the status of TP53. Thirty ACC patients were included. Four of 30 patients showed aberrant DHPLC configuration and direct sequencing confirmed 2 (7%) germline mutations (R337H, R248W), 1 (3%) somatic mutation (R213X), and 1 (3%) noncoding polymorphism (g.17708 A>T). The only patient with a positive family history harbored a TP53 mutation. Tumors of the three patients with mutations showed aberrant p53 expression in more than 10% of cells by immunostaining, compared to only 3 of 27 patients without mutations (p = 0.009). Aberrant p53 expression (>5%) was detected in 12/30 (40%) ACCs. The latter was associated with an increased Ki67 and van Slooten index (p ≤ 0.001; p = 0.020). Disease-free survival decreased significantly in patients with aberrant p53 IHC of more than 5% of cells (65.7 ± 12.4 vs. 26.6 ± 8.7 months; p = 0.043 log rank test). Patients with ACC revealed aberrant expression of p53 in 40%, and mutations were identified in 25% of these patients. Therefore aberrant p53 expression should be considered an indicator for genetic testing. A subgroup of apparently sporadic ACC is caused by TP53 germline mutations, and family history is a strong indicator for p53 germline mutations.	4
Hypoxia-Induced Cisplatin Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells Is Mediated by HIF-1α and Mutant p53 and Can Be Overcome by Induction of Oxidative Stress. ||  || The compound APR-246 (PRIMA-1MET) is a known reactivator of (mutant) p53 and inducer of oxidative stress which can sensitize cancer cells to platinum-based chemotherapeutics. However, the effect of a hypoxic tumor environment has been largely overlooked in this interaction. This study focusses on the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&alpha; (HIF-1&alpha;) and the p53 tumor suppressor protein in hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and the potential of APR-246 to overcome this resistance. We observed that hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance only occurred in the p53 mutant NCI-H2228Q331* cell line, and not in the wild type A549 and mutant NCI-H1975R273H cell lines. Cisplatin reduced HIF-1&alpha; protein levels in NCI-H2228Q331* cells, leading to a shift in expression from HIF-1&alpha;-dependent to p53-dependent transcription targets under hypoxia. APR-246 was able to overcome hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance in NCI-H2228Q331* cells in a synergistic manner without affecting mutant p53Q331* transcriptional activity, but significantly depleting total glutathione levels more efficiently under hypoxic conditions. Synergism was dependent on the presence of mutant p53Q331* and the induction of reactive oxygen species, with depletion of one or the other leading to loss of synergism. Our data further support the rationale of combining APR-246 with cisplatin in NSCLC, since their synergistic interaction is retained or enforced under hypoxic conditions in the presence of mutant p53.	0
Characterization of a disease-causing Glu119-Lys mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in two Danish families with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || Mutations in the gene for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL receptor) cause the autosomal dominant inherited disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In 15 Danish patients with heterozygous FH we have screened exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene for point mutations and small rearrangements employing genomic DNA amplification and bidirectional solid-phase sequencing. Two subjects were found to be heterozygous for a guanine to adenine base substitution at nucleotide position 418 of the LDL receptor cDNA. This point mutation results in an amino acid change from glutamic acid to lysine at amino acid residue 119 in the third repeat of the cysteine-rich ligand binding domain of the mature LDL receptor. Disruption of LDL receptor function by the Glu119-Lys mutation was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in COS-7 cells. By Western blotting the mutation was found to affect the processing of the LDL receptor protein. Using flow cytometric analysis of the transfected cells a decreased binding and internalization of LDL by the mutant receptor was documented. By means of a mutation-specific PCR-based assay the Glu119-Lys mutation was not detected in another 85 apparently unrelated Danish heterozygous FH patients. We identified six persons in the index families with the Glu119-Lys mutation cosegregating with the clinical syndrome of FH in these families. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that the haplotype [SfaNI+, StuI+, AvaII-, (dTA)7] of the mutation carrying allele was the same in the two apparently unrelated patients. This indicates that the mutation has been inherited from a common ancestor.	4
Molecular characterization of phenylketonuria in South Brazil. || Brazil DNA Mutational Analysis Genotype Haplotypes Humans Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Genetic Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Restriction Mapping || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. The PAH gene, located at 12q22-q24.1, includes about 90kb and contains 13 exons. To date, more than 420 different alterations have been identified in the PAH gene. To determine the nature and frequency of PAH mutations in PKU patients from South Brazil, mutation analysis was performed on genomic DNA from 23 unrelated PKU patients. The 13 exons and flanking regions of the PAH gene were amplified by PCR and the amplicons were analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Amplicons that showed abnormal migration patterns were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and/or sequencing. Twenty-two previously reported mutations were identified including R261X, R408W, IVS2nt5g-->c, R261Q, and V388M. Polymorphisms were observed in 48.8% of the PKU patients, the most frequent being IVS2nt19t-->c, V245V, and IVS12nt-35c-->t. In addition, two novel sequence variants were identified: 1378g-->t in the 3(')-untranslated region in exon 13 which may be disease-causing and an intron 12 polymorphism, IVS12nt-15t-->c. The mutation spectrum in the patients from Southern Brazil differed from that observed in patients from other Latin American countries and further defined the molecular heterogeneity of this disease.	3

In order to provide high quality genetic testing to eyeGENE(®)'s enrolled patients which potentially aids clinical diagnosis and disease treatment, we carried out a pilot study and performed Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based molecular diagnosis for 105 Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patients randomly selected from the network. A custom capture panel was designed, which incorporated 195 known retinal disease genes, including 61 known RP genes. As a result, disease-causing mutations were identified in 52 out of 105 probands (solving rate of 49.5%). A total of 82 mutations were identified, and 48 of them were novel. Interestingly, for three probands the molecular diagnosis was inconsistent with the initial clinical diagnosis, while for five probands the molecular information suggested a different inheritance model other than that assigned by the physician. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that NGS target sequencing is efficient and sufficiently precise for molecular diagnosis of a highly heterogeneous patient cohort from eyeGENE(®).	4
Hearing loss: frequency and functional studies of the most common connexin26 alleles. || Alleles Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Gene Frequency HeLa Cells Humans Italy Mutation Mutation, Missense Protein Conformation || Mutations in the GJB2 gene, encoding the gap-junction channel protein connexin 26, account for the majority of recessive forms and some of the dominant cases of deafness. Here, we report the frequency of GJB2 alleles in the Italian population affected by hearing loss and the functional analysis of six missense mutations. Genetic studies indicate that, apart from the common 35delG, only few additional mutations can be detected with a significant frequency in our population. Transfection of communication-incompetent HeLa cells with Cx26 missense mutations revealed three distinct classes of functional deficits in terms of protein expression, subcellular localisation and/or functional activity. Moreover, the M34T mutant acted as a dominant inhibitor of wild-type Cx26 channel activity when the two proteins were co-expressed in a manner mimicking a heterozygous genotype. These data support the hypothesis of a functional role for M34T as a dominant allele and represent a further step towards a complete understanding of the role of GJB2 in causing hearing loss.	0

However, contradictory results concerning the role of β-catenin in human melanoma address an open question on its oncogenic nature and prognostic value in this tumour. Changes in WNT signaling pathways have been linked to phenotype switching of melanoma cells between a highly proliferative/non-invasive and a slow proliferative/metastatic condition. We used a novel panel of cell lines isolated from melanoma specimens, at initial passages, to investigate phenotype differences related to the levels and activity of WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. This in vitro cell system revealed a marked heterogeneity that comprises, in some cases, two distinct tumour-derived subpopulations of cells presenting a different activation level and cellular distribution of β-catenin. In cells derived from the same tumor, we demonstrated that the prevalence of LEF1 (high β-catenin expressing cells) or TCF4 (low β-catenin expressing cells) as β-catenin partner for DNA binding, is associated to the expression of two distinct profiles of WNT-responsive genes. Interestingly, melanoma cells expressing relative low level of β-catenin and an invasive markers signature were associated to the TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory pathway and to the chemotherapy resistance, suggesting that the co-existence of melanoma subpopulations with distinct biological properties could influence the impact of chemo- and immunotherapy.	0
Hearing function in heterozygous carriers of a pathogenic GJB2 gene mutation. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Connexin 26 Connexins Czech Republic Female Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Hearing Tests Heterozygote Humans Incidence Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Risk Factors || The most frequent hereditary hearing loss is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene coding for the gap junction beta 2 protein Connexin 26 (Cx26). In contrast to many studies performed in patients with bi-allelic mutations, audiometric studies on heterozygotes are sparse and often contradictory. To evaluate hearing function in heterozygous carriers of the GJB2 c.35delG mutation, audiometry over the extended frequency range and the recording of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), i.e., transient-evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) and distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs), were performed in a group of parents and grandparents of deaf children homozygous for the GJB2 c.35delG mutation. The comparison of audiograms between control and heterozygous subjects was enabled using audiogram normalization for age and sex. Hearing loss, estimated with this procedure, was found to be significantly larger in GJB2 c.35delG heterozygous females in comparison with controls for the frequencies of 8-16 kHz; the deterioration of hearing in heterozygous men in comparison with controls was not statistically significant. A comparison of TEOAE responses and DPOAE levels between GJB2 c.35delG heterozygotes and controls did not reveal any significant differences. The results prove the importance of using audiometry over the extended frequency range and audiogram normalization for age and sex to detect minor hearing impairments, even in a relatively small group of subjects of different ages.	4
Enhanced utility of family-centered diagnostic exome sequencing with inheritance model-based analysis: results from 500 unselected families with undiagnosed genetic conditions. || Adult Cohort Studies Databases, Genetic Exome Female Heredity Humans Male Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Sequence Analysis, DNA || Diagnostic exome sequencing was immediately successful in diagnosing patients in whom traditional technologies were uninformative. Herein, we provide the results from the first 500 probands referred to a clinical laboratory for diagnostic exome sequencing. Family-based exome sequencing included whole-exome sequencing followed by family inheritance-based model filtering, comprehensive medical review, familial cosegregation analysis, and analysis of novel genes. A positive or likely positive result in a characterized gene was identified in 30% of patients (152/500). A novel gene finding was identified in 7.5% of patients (31/416). The highest diagnostic rates were observed among patients with ataxia, multiple congenital anomalies, and epilepsy (44, 36, and 35%, respectively). Twenty-three percent of positive findings were within genes characterized within the past 2 years. The diagnostic rate was significantly higher among families undergoing a trio (37%) as compared with a singleton (21%) whole-exome testing strategy. Overall, we present results from the largest clinical cohort of diagnostic exome sequencing cases to date. These data demonstrate the utility of family-based exome sequencing and analysis to obtain the highest reported detection rate in an unselected clinical cohort, illustrating the utility of diagnostic exome sequencing as a transformative technology for the molecular diagnosis of genetic disease.	4
Molecular Screening of Small Biopsy Samples Using Next-Generation Sequencing in Korean Patients with Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Korean Lung Cancer Consortium (KLCC-13-01). ||  || Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common type of cancer with poor prognosis. As individual cancers exhibit unique mutation patterns, identifying and characterizing gene mutations in NSCLC might help predict patient outcomes and guide treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical adequacy of molecular testing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) for small biopsy samples and characterize the mutational landscape of Korean patients with advanced NSCLC. DNA was extracted from small biopsy samples of 162 patients with advanced NSCLC. Targeted NGS of genomic alterations was conducted using Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. The median age of patients was 64 years (range, 32 to 83 years) and the majority had stage IV NSCLC at the time of cancer diagnosis (90%). Among the 162 patients, 161 patients (99.4%) had novel or hotspot mutations (range, 1 to 21 mutated genes). Mutations were found in 41 genes. Three of the most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (151, 93.2%),KDR (104, 64.2%), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; 69, 42.6%). We also observed coexistence ofEGFR and other oncogene (such asKRAS,PIC3CA,PTEN, andSTK11) mutations. Given that 69.6% (48/69) ofEGFR mutant patients were treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors,EGFR mutant status had higher prognostic ability in this study. These results suggest that targeted NGS using small biopsy samples is feasible and allows for the detection of both common and rare mutations in NSCLC.	4

Comprehensive data are needed to assist clinical risk assessment and genetic testing. Germ-line DNA samples from 727 unrelated probands with positive family history (521 met criteria for familial pancreatic cancer) were tested in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (including analysis of deletions and rearrangements), PALB2, and CDKN2A. We compared prevalence of deleterious mutations between familial pancreatic cancer probands and nonfamilial pancreatic cancer probands (kindreds containing at least two affected biological relatives, but not first-degree relatives). We also examined the impact of family history on breast and ovarian cancers and melanoma. Prevalence of deleterious mutations (excluding variants of unknown significance) among familial pancreatic cancer probands was: BRCA1, 1.2%; BRCA2, 3.7%; PALB2, 0.6%; and CDKN2A, 2.5%. Four novel deleterious mutations were detected. Familial pancreatic cancer probands carry more mutations in the four genes (8.0%) than nonfamilial pancreatic cancer probands (3.5%) (odds ratio: 2.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-5.44; P = 0.03). The probability of testing positive for deleterious mutations in any of the four genes ranges up to 10.4%, depending on family history of cancers. BRCA2 and CDKN2A account for the majority of mutations in familial pancreatic cancer. Genetic testing of multiple relevant genes in probands with a positive family history is warranted, particularly for familial pancreatic cancer.	4
Micropapillary colorectal carcinoma: clinical, pathological and molecular properties, including evidence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. || Adenocarcinoma, Papillary Adult Aged Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Female Humans Immunohistochemistry Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged || Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with micropapillary (MP) features has only been described recently and is still being characterized. We reviewed the clinicopathological and molecular features of 42 CRC with MP features. Twenty-nine cases were also evaluated for immunohistochemical evidence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The extent of MP features within our cohort ranged from 5% (13 cases) to 100% (one case). Twenty-seven cases featured prominent cribriforming with dirty necrosis in the non-MP component; nine displayed mucinous features. Twenty-four of 29 cases (83%) demonstrated evidence of EMT. Thirty-six cases (86%) showed advanced T-category (pT3 or pT4), 31 (74%) had lymph node metastases and 23 (55%) had distant metastases. Median overall follow-up was 36 months. Seventeen patients (40%) died of disease, with median survival of 23 months. Mutations were seen in 17 of 31 tested cases (55%), including 11 KRAS mutations and four BRAF V600E mutations. Microsatellite instability testing was performed on 21 cases; all were microsatellite-stable. Compared to a cohort of 972 conventional CRC, MP CRC was more likely to present as stage IV disease (P < 0.001), but patients with MP CRC showed no significant differences in overall survival after adjusting for stage. Micropapillary features in CRC portend a high likelihood of advanced local disease and distant metastases. MP CRC is often associated with a cribriform pattern elsewhere in the tumour and cystic nodal metastases with prominent necrosis. They also show frequent mutations in KRAS and BRAF. Immunohistochemical evidence of EMT is common in MP CRC.	4
In vitro differential sensitivity of melanomas to phenothiazines is based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation. || Amino Acid Substitution Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Codon Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Glutamic Acid Humans Melanoma Mutant Proteins Mutation Phenothiazines Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Reproducibility of Results Valine ras Proteins || The panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) assembled by the National Cancer Institute for anticancer drug discovery is a widely used resource. We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers. The findings reported here have potential implications for the use of phenothiazines in the treatment of V600E BRAF mutant melanoma.	0
Mutational burdens and evolutionary ages of thyroid follicular adenoma are comparable to those of follicular carcinoma. || Adenocarcinoma, Follicular Adenoma Adult Aged DNA Copy Number Variations Female Gene Fusion Genome Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Thyroid Neoplasms || Follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) precedes follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) by definition with a favorable prognosis compared to FTC. However, the genetic mechanism of FTA to FTC progression remains unknown. For this, it is required to disclose FTA and FTC genomes in mutational and evolutionary perspectives. We performed whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling of 14 FTAs and 13 FTCs, which exhibited previously-known gene mutations (NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, TSHR and EIF1AX) and copy number alterations (CNAs) (22q loss and 1q gain) in follicular tumors. In addition, we found eleven potential cancer-related genes with mutations (EZH1, SPOP, NF1, TCF12, IGF2BP3, KMT2C, CNOT1, BRIP1, KDM5C, STAG2 and MAP4K3) that have not been reported in thyroid follicular tumors. Of note, FTA genomes showed comparable levels of mutations to FTC in terms of the number, sequence composition and functional consequences (potential driver mutations) of mutations. Analyses of evolutionary ages using somatic mutations as molecular clocks further identified that FTA genomes were as old as FTC genomes. Whole-transcriptome sequencing did not find any gene fusions with potential significance. Our data indicate that FTA genomes may be as old as FTC genomes, thus suggesting that follicular thyroid tumor genomes during the transition from FTA to FTC may stand stable at genomic levels in contrast to the discernable changes at pathologic and clinical levels. Also, the data suggest a possibility that the mutational profiles obtained from early biopsies may be useful for the molecular diagnosis and therapeutics of follicular tumor patients.	4
Differential enhancement of a cutaneous HPV promoter by DeltaNP63alpha, Jun and mutant p53. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic DNA, Viral DNA-Binding Proteins Down-Regulation Gene Expression Regulation, Viral Genes, Tumor Suppressor Genes, Viral Humans Mutation Papillomaviridae Phosphoproteins Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Protein Isoforms Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Trans-Activators Transcription Factors Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins Virus Activation Virus Replication || The mechanism through which cutaneous papillomaviruses induce lesions is largely unknown. Ectopic expression of the DeltaNp63alpha isoform highly increased the viral promoter activity. The co-expression of c-Jun mediated and increased the DeltaNp63alpha activity by binding to the AP-1 site in an enhancer region of the HPV 20 URR. This strong activation by DeltaNp63alpha is diminished in the presence of wtp53 and abolished by the simultaneous expression of "hot-spot" mutant p53 R248W. We demonstrate that c-Jun is responsible for the viral promoter activation through its direct interaction with both DeltaNp63alpha and wtp53. The downregulation by p53 mutant R248W is accompanied by reduced protein levels of DeltaNp63alpha and phosphorylated c-Jun. The data presented in this study provide insight into a possible mechanism through which these cellular proteins may modulate a cutaneous papillomavirus genome to induce viral replication, latent infection or malignant transformation.	0
Intellectual, neurologic, and neuropsychologic outcome in untreated subjects with nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia. German Collaborative Study on Phenylketonuria. || Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors Attention Career Choice Data Interpretation, Statistical Female Genotype Humans Intelligence Job Satisfaction Learning Disorders Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Movement Disorders Nervous System Diseases Neurotic Disorders Phenotype Phenylalanine Phenylketonurias Problem Solving Psychomotor Performance Tremor || Based on the serum phenylalanine levels under free diet patients with hyperphenylalaninemia are classified as "classical" (>1200 micromol/L), "mild" (600-1200 micromol/L), or "non-phenylketonuria (PKU)-hyperphenylalaninemia" (<600 micromol/L). Recent studies revealed intellectual, neurologic, and neuropsychologic deficits as well as abnormalities of cerebral white matter (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) in patients with early and adequately treated PKU. In addition deficits in IQ were reported for a group of 4-y-old patients with untreated mild PKU and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (serum phenylalanine levels below 900 micromol/L). As a consequence, a lifelong diet with serum phenylalanine levels below 400 micromol/L was recommended even for those patients with serum phenylalanine levels remaining consistently between 400 and 600 micromol/L. Generally patients with non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia were not treated, as a normal outcome was suspected, but the clinical development of patients with non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia was not so far studied systematically. We assessed 28 untreated patients with non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (age: mean = 21.8, SD = 4.2 y) for IQ, school and job career, clinical-neurologic development, fine motor performances, selective and sustained attention, as well as for frontal lobe-dependent "executive functions." In addition, cranial MRI was obtained in 10 of these patients. Compared with healthy control subjects, matched for age, sex, and socioeconomic status, the patients reached normal results in all clinical and psychometric tests. Cranial MRI revealed no abnormalities. Additionally, no significant correlations between serum phenylalanine levels and test results were obtained. In the absence of any demonstrative effect, treatment is unlikely to be of significant effect in patients with non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia.	1 3
The putative oncotarget CSN5 controls a transcription-uncorrelated p53-mediated autophagy implicated in cancer cell survival under curcumin treatment. || Antineoplastic Agents Autophagy COP9 Signalosome Complex Cell Survival Curcumin HeLa Cells Hep G2 Cells Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Neoplasms Peptide Hydrolases RNA, Small Interfering Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Curcumin has shown promise as a safe and specific anticancer agent. The COP9 signalosome (CSN) component CSN5, a known specific target for curcumin, can control p53 stability by increasing its degradation through ubiquitin system. But the correlation of CSN5-controlled p53 to anticancer therapeutic effect of curcumin is currently unknown. Here we showed that CSN5-controlled p53 was transcriptional inactive and responsible for autophagy in human normal BJ cells and cancer HepG2 cells under curcumin treatment. Of note, CSN5-initiated cellular autophagy by curcumin treatment was abolished in p53-null HCT116p53-/- cancer cells, which could be rescued by reconstitution with wild-type p53 or transcription inactive p53 mutant p53R273H. Furthermore, CSN5-controlled p53 conferred a pro-survival autophagy in diverse cancer cells response to curcumin. Genetic p53 deletion, as well as autophagy pharmacological inhibition by chloroquine, significantly enhanced the therapeutic effect of curcumin on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, but not normal cells. This study identifies a novel CSN5-controlled p53 in autophagy of human cells. The p53 expression state is a useful biomarker for predicting the anticancer therapeutic effect of curcumin. Therefore, the pharmacologic autophagy manipulation may benefit the ongoing anticancer clinical trials of curcumin.	0
Whole Exome Sequencing and Molecular Modeling of a Missense Variant in TNFAIP3 That Segregates with Disease in a Family with Chronic Urticaria and Angioedema. ||  || Chronic urticaria is a common condition characterized by recurrent hives lasting several weeks or months and is usually idiopathic. Approximately half of the individuals with chronic urticaria will present with episodes of angioedema that can be severe and debilitating. In this report, we describe a 47-year-old Hispanic male who presented initially for an evaluation of chronic hives following hospitalization due to hive-induced anaphylaxis. The individual had a history significant for urticaria and angioedema beginning in his early 30s. Interestingly, both the individual's 41-year-old sister and 12-year-old daughter were also affected with chronic urticaria and severe angioedema. Whole exome sequencing of the proband and several family members revealed a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in exon 2 of TNFAIP3, denoted as c.65G>A (p.R22Q), in all affected members. Variants inTNFAIP3 have been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, susceptibility to allergy and asthma, and periodic fever syndromes, suggesting that this variant could potentially play a role in disease.	4
Cellular and molecular mechanisms of autosomal dominant form of progressive hearing loss, DFNA2. || Animals CHO Cells Cricetinae Cricetulus Disease Progression Endoplasmic Reticulum Genes, Dominant Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans KCNQ Potassium Channels Membrane Potentials Membrane Proteins Point Mutation Protein Structure, Tertiary Transfection || Despite advances in identifying deafness genes, determination of the underlying cellular and functional mechanisms for auditory diseases remains a challenge. Mutations of the human K(+) channel hKv7.4 lead to post-lingual progressive hearing loss (DFNA2), which affects world-wide population with diverse racial backgrounds. Here, we have generated the spectrum of point mutations in the hKv7.4 that have been identified as diseased mutants. We report that expression of five point mutations in the pore region, namely L274H, W276S, L281S, G285C, and G296S, as well as the C-terminal mutant G321S in the heterologous expression system, yielded non-functional channels because of endoplasmic reticulum retention of the mutant channels. We mimicked the dominant diseased conditions by co-expressing the wild-type and mutant channels. As compared with expression of wild-type channel alone, the blend of wild-type and mutant channel subunits resulted in reduced currents. Moreover, the combinatorial ratios of wild type:mutant and the ensuing current magnitude could not be explained by the predictions of a tetrameric channel and a dominant negative effect of the mutant subunits. The results can be explained by the dependence of cell surface expression of the mutant on the wild-type subunit. Surprisingly, a transmembrane mutation F182L, which has been identified in a pre-lingual progressive hearing loss patient in Taiwan, yielded cell surface expression and functional features that were similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that this mutation may represent redundant polymorphism. Collectively, these findings provide traces of the cellular mechanisms for DFNA2.	0
Stamping out RAF and MEK1/2 to inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway: an emerging threat to anticancer therapy. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Humans MAP Kinase Kinase 1 MAP Kinase Kinase 2 MAP Kinase Signaling System Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Neoplasms raf Kinases || The RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is a key signal transduction pathway in the cells. Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for >25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).	0
Connexins and gap junctions in the inner ear--it's not just about K⁺ recycling. || Animals Biophysical Phenomena Connexins Ear, Inner Gap Junctions Homeostasis Humans Potassium || Normal development, function and repair of the sensory epithelia in the inner ear are all dependent on gap junctional intercellular communication. Mutations in the connexin genes GJB2 and GJB6 (encoding CX26 and CX30) result in syndromic and non-syndromic deafness via various mechanisms. Clinical vestibular defects, however, are harder to connect with connexin dysfunction. Cx26 and Cx30 proteins are widely expressed in the epithelial and connective tissues of the cochlea, where they may form homomeric or heteromeric gap junction channels in a cell-specific and spatiotemporally complex fashion. Despite the study of mutant channels and animal models for both recessive and dominant autosomal deafness, it is still unclear why gap junctions are essential for auditory function, and why Cx26 and Cx30 do not compensate for each other in vivo. Cx26 appears to be essential for normal development of the auditory sensory epithelium, but may be dispensable during normal hearing. Cx30 appears to be essential for normal repair following sensory cell loss. The specific modes of intercellular signalling mediated by inner ear gap junction channels remain undetermined, but they are hypothesised to play essential roles in the maintenance of ionic and metabolic homeostasis in the inner ear. Recent studies have highlighted involvement of gap junctions in the transfer of essential second messengers between the non-sensory cells, and have proposed roles for hemichannels in normal hearing. Here, we summarise the current knowledge about the molecular and functional properties of inner ear gap junctions, and about tissue pathologies associated with connexin mutations.	0
Effect of TP53 contact and conformational mutations on cell survival and erythropoiesis of human hematopoietic stem cells in a long term culture model. ||  || TP53 deficiencies characterize myeloid malignancies with a dismal prognosis. To unravel the pathomechanism ofTP53 mutations in the development of myeloid malignancies, we analyzed the functional properties ofTP53 conformational and contact mutations andTP53 loss in human CD34+ cells. We show for the first time that the analyzed conformational mutations lead to higher cell viability in human hematopoietic stem progenitor cells. In contrast to these conformational mutations, contact mutations interfered with efficient erythropoiesis. These findings show that not only the detection of aTP53 mutation is important, but also the specific mutation may play a role in malignant transformation and progression.	0
Unequal prognostic potentials of p53 gain-of-function mutations in human cancers associate with drug-metabolizing activity. || Antineoplastic Agents Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Line, Tumor Cluster Analysis Computational Biology Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Databases, Genetic Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Mutation Neoplasms Phenotype Prognosis RNA Interference Reproducibility of Results Survival Analysis Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || Mutation of p53 is the most common genetic change in human cancer, causing complex effects including not only loss of wild-type function but also gain of novel oncogenic functions (GOF). It is increasingly likely that p53-hotspot mutations may confer different types and magnitudes of GOF, but the evidences are mainly supported by cellular and transgenic animal models. Here we combine large-scale cancer genomic data to characterize the prognostic significance of different p53 mutations in human cancers. Unexpectedly, only mutations on the Arg248 and Arg282 positions displayed significant association with shorter patient survival, but such association was not evident for other hotspot GOF mutations. Gene set enrichment analysis on these mutations revealed higher activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, including the CYP3A4 cytochrome P450. Ectopic expression of p53 mutant R282W in H1299 and SaOS2 cells significantly upregulated CYP3A4 mRNA and protein levels, and cancer cell lines bearing mortality-associated p53 mutations display higher CYP3A4 expression and resistance to several CYP3A4-metabolized chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results suggest that p53 mutations have unequal GOF activities in human cancers, and future evaluation of p53 as a cancer biomarker should consider which mutation is present in the tumor, rather than having comparison between wild-type and mutant genotypes.	0
Germline variants in the SEMA4A gene predispose to familial colorectal cancer type X. || Adult Aged Amino Acid Sequence Colorectal Neoplasms Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Germ Cells Humans Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense Phorbols Semaphorins Sequence Alignment || Familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX) is characterized by clinical features of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer with a yet undefined genetic background. Here we identify the SEMA4A p.Val78Met germline mutation in an Austrian kindred with FCCTX, using an integrative genomics strategy. Compared with wild-type protein, SEMA4A(V78M) demonstrates significantly increased MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt signalling as well as cell cycle progression of SEMA4A-deficient HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells. In a cohort of 53 patients with FCCTX, we depict two further SEMA4A mutations, p.Gly484Ala and p.Ser326Phe and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) p.Pro682Ser. This SNP is highly associated with the FCCTX phenotype exhibiting increased risk for colorectal cancer (OR 6.79, 95% CI 2.63 to 17.52). Our study shows previously unidentified germline variants in SEMA4A predisposing to FCCTX, which has implications for surveillance strategies of patients and their families.	4
Selective cytotoxicity of intracellular amyloid beta peptide1-42 through p53 and Bax in cultured primary human neurons. || Alzheimer Disease Amyloid beta-Peptides Apoptosis Astrocytes Brain Caspase Inhibitors Caspases Cells, Cultured Enzyme Inhibitors Fetus Humans Intracellular Fluid Microscopy, Electron Neurons Peptide Fragments Plaque, Amyloid Polymers Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 bcl-2-Associated X Protein || Extracellular amyloid beta peptides (Abetas) have long been thought to be a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Now, detection of intracellular neuronal Abeta1--42 accumulation before extracellular Abeta deposits questions the relevance of intracellular peptides in AD. In the present study, we directly address whether intracellular Abeta is toxic to human neurons. Microinjections of Abeta1--42 peptide or a cDNA-expressing cytosolic Abeta1--42 rapidly induces cell death of primary human neurons. In contrast, Abeta1--40, Abeta40--1, or Abeta42--1 peptides, and cDNAs expressing cytosolic Abeta1--40 or secreted Abeta1--42 and Abeta1--40, are not toxic. As little as a 1-pM concentration or 1500 molecules/cell of Abeta1--42 peptides is neurotoxic. The nonfibrillized and fibrillized Abeta1--42 peptides are equally toxic. In contrast, Abeta1--42 peptides are not toxic to human primary astrocytes, neuronal, and nonneuronal cell lines. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis protects against Abeta1--42 toxicity, indicating that programmed cell death is involved. Bcl-2, Bax-neutralizing antibodies, cDNA expression of a p53R273H dominant negative mutant, and caspase inhibitors prevent Abeta1--42-mediated human neuronal cell death. Taken together, our data directly demonstrate that intracellular Abeta1--42 is selectively cytotoxic to human neurons through the p53--Bax cell death pathway.	0
Heterogeneous biomedical database integration using a hybrid strategy: a p53 cancer research database. ||  || Complex problems in life science research give rise to multidisciplinary collaboration, and hence, to the need for heterogeneous database integration. The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in close to 50% of human cancers, and a small drug-like molecule with the ability to restore native function to cancerous p53 mutants is a long-held medical goal of cancer treatment. The Cancer Research DataBase (CRDB) was designed in support of a project to find such small molecules. As a cancer informatics project, the CRDB involved small molecule data, computational docking results, functional assays, and protein structure data. As an example of the hybrid strategy for data integration, it combined the mediation and data warehousing approaches. This paper uses the CRDB to illustrate the hybrid strategy as a viable approach to heterogeneous data integration in biomedicine, and provides a design method for those considering similar systems. More efficient data sharing implies increased productivity, and, hopefully, improved chances of success in cancer research.

Rare variants in genes encoding MuRF1 and MuRF2 are modifiers of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Female Genetic Variation Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle Proteins Mutation Myocardium Tripartite Motif Proteins Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases || Modifier genes contribute to the diverse clinical manifestations of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), but are still largely unknown. Muscle ring finger (MuRF) proteins are a class of muscle-specific ubiquitin E3-ligases that appear to modulate cardiac mass and function by regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this study we screened all the three members of the MuRF family, MuRF1, MuRF2 and MuRF3, in 594 unrelated HCM patients and 307 healthy controls by targeted resequencing. Identified rare variants were confirmed by capillary Sanger sequencing. The prevalence of rare variants in both MuRF1 and MuRF2 in HCM patients was higher than that in control subjects (MuRF1 13/594 (2.2%) vs. 1/307 (0.3%), p = 0.04; MuRF2 22/594 (3.7%) vs. 2/307 (0.7%); p = 0.007). Patients with rare variants in MuRF1 or MuRF2 were younger (p = 0.04) and had greater maximum left ventricular wall thickness (p = 0.006) than those without such variants. Mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins were present in 19 (55.9%) of the 34 HCM patients with rare variants in MuRF1 and MuRF2. These data strongly supported that rare variants in MuRF1 and MuRF2 are associated with higher penetrance and more severe clinical manifestations of HCM. The findings suggest that dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system contributes to the pathogenesis of HCM.	4
Allelic frequencies of the 35delG mutation of the GJB2 gene in different Brazilian regions. || Alleles Brazil Connexin 26 Connexins Gene Frequency Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Testing Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation || Mutations in the GJB2 gene, which encodes the protein connexin 26, are a major cause of autosomal recessive deafness. The most frequent mutation, 35delG, has a carrier frequency as high as 4% in some countries, and this frequency varies in different ethnic groups. Most of the Brazilian population results from interethnic crosses of people from three continents (European, African, and Amerindian), and the proportion of each varies according to the geographical region of the country. To verify if the different ethnic composition of Brazilian regions leads to variable 35delG carrier frequencies, we performed the screening of the 35delG mutation using DNA from dried-blood filter paper samples obtained from 1,856 newborns from 10 cities in different regions. The 35delG mutation was found in 25 individuals (1.35%), indicating an overall carrier frequency of 1:74. This frequency was 1:47 in the north, 1:64 in the southeast, 1:85 in the south and 1:124 in the northeast, but these differences were not significant. The overall frequency of the 35delG allele was estimated as 0.0067, and comparison between expected and observed genotype frequencies indicates that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.	4
Rational design of small-molecule stabilizers of spermine synthase dimer by virtual screening and free energy-based approach. || Binding Sites Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Crystallography, X-Ray Drug Design Humans Intellectual Disability Mental Retardation, X-Linked Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Mutation, Missense Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Interaction Mapping Protein Multimerization Spermine Synthase Thermodynamics || Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS) is a rare mental retardation disorder which is caused by the malfunctioning of an enzyme, the spermine synthase (SMS), which functions as a homo-dimer. The malfunctioning of SMS in SRS patients is associated with several identified missense mutations that occur away from the active site. This investigation deals with a particular SRS-causing mutation, the G56S mutation, which was shown computationally and experimentally to destabilize the SMS homo-dimer and thus to abolish SMS enzymatic activity. As a proof-of-concept, we explore the possibility to restore the enzymatic activity of the malfunctioning SMS mutant G56S by stabilizing the dimer through small molecule binding at the mutant homo-dimer interface. For this purpose, we designed an in silico protocol that couples virtual screening and a free binding energy-based approach to identify potential small-molecule binders on the destabilized G56S dimer, with the goal to stabilize it and thus to increase SMS G56S mutant activity. The protocol resulted in extensive list of plausible stabilizers, among which we selected and tested 51 compounds experimentally for their capability to increase SMS G56S mutant enzymatic activity. In silico analysis of the experimentally identified stabilizers suggested five distinctive chemical scaffolds. This investigation suggests that druggable pockets exist in the vicinity of the mutation sites at protein-protein interfaces which can be used to alter the disease-causing effects by small molecule binding. The identified chemical scaffolds are drug-like and can serve as original starting points for development of lead molecules to further rescue the disease-causing effects of the Snyder-Robinson syndrome for which no efficient treatment exists up to now.	0
Noonan syndrome. || Adolescent Adult Child Child Development Child, Preschool Female Genetic Counseling Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis Prognosis Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases || Noonan Syndrome (NS) is characterised by short stature, typical facial dysmorphology and congenital heart defects. The incidence of NS is estimated to be between 1:1000 and 1:2500 live births. The main facial features of NS are hypertelorism with down-slanting palpebral fissures, ptosis and low-set posteriorly rotated ears with a thickened helix. The cardiovascular defects most commonly associated with this condition are pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other associated features are webbed neck, chest deformity, mild intellectual deficit, cryptorchidism, poor feeding in infancy, bleeding tendency and lymphatic dysplasias. The syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In approximately 50% of cases, the disease is caused by missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12, resulting in a gain of function of the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 protein. Recently, mutations in the KRAS gene have been identified in a small proportion of patients with NS. A DNA test for mutation analysis can be carried out on blood, chorionic villi and amniotic fluid samples. NS should be considered in all foetuses with polyhydramnion, pleural effusions, oedema and increased nuchal fluid with a normal karyotype. With special care and counselling, the majority of children with NS will grow up and function normally in the adult world. Management should address feeding problems in early childhood, evaluation of cardiac function and assessment of growth and motor development. Physiotherapy and/or speech therapy should be offered if indicated. A complete eye examination and hearing evaluation should be performed during the first few years of schooling. Preoperative coagulation studies are indicated. Signs and symptoms lessen with age and most adults with NS do not require special medical care.	4
Targeted exome sequencing of Korean triple-negative breast cancer reveals homozygous deletions associated with poor prognosis of adjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients. || DNA repair pathway copy number variation single nucleotide variant targeted exome sequencing triple-negative breast cancer || Triple-negative breast cancer is characterized by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and is associated with a poorer outcome than other subtypes of breast cancer. Moreover, there are no accurate prognostic genes or effective therapeutic targets, thereby necessitating continued intensive investigation. This study analyzed the genetic mutation landscape in 70 patients with triple-negative breast cancer by targeted exome sequencing of tumor and matched normal samples. Sequencing showed that more than 50% of these patients had deleterious mutations and homozygous deletions of DNA repair genes, such as <i>ATM</i>, <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>WRN</i>, and <i>CHEK2</i>. These findings suggested that a large number of patients with triple-negative breast cancer have impaired DNA repair function and that therefore a poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor may be an effective drug in the treatment of this disease. Notably, homozygous deletion of three genes, <i>EPHA5</i>, <i>MITF</i>, and <i>ACSL</i>3, was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence or distant metastasis in adjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients.	4
PLK1 blockade enhances therapeutic effects of radiation by inducing cell cycle arrest at the mitotic phase. || 4-Aminobenzoic Acid Animals Apoptosis Azepines Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation HCT116 Cells HeLa Cells Humans M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Nude Mitosis Neoplasms Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins Radiation Tolerance Radiation-Sensitizing Agents Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || The cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation depends on the cell cycle phase; therefore, its pharmacological manipulation, especially the induction of cell cycle arrest at the radiosensitive mitotic-phase (M-phase), has been attempted for effective radiation therapy. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions in mitotic progression, and is now recognized as a potential target for radiosensitization. We herein investigated whether PLK1 blockade enhanced the cytotoxic effects of radiation by modulating cell cycle phases of cancer cells using the novel small molecule inhibitor of PLK1, TAK-960. The TAK-960 treatment exhibited radiosensitizing effects in vitro, especially when it increased the proportion of M-phase cells. TAK-960 did not sensitize cancer cells to radiation when an insufficient amount of time was provided to induce mitotic arrest. The overexpression of a PLK1 mutant, PLK1-R136G&T210D, which was confirmed to cancel the TAK-960-mediated increase in the proportion of mitotic cells, abrogated the radiosensitizing effects of TAK-960. A tumor growth delay assay also demonstrated that the radiosensitizing effects of TAK-960 depended on an increase in the proportion of M-phase cells. These results provide a rational basis for targeting PLK1 for radiosensitization when considering the therapeutic time window for M-phase arrest as the best timing for radiation treatments.	0
Population carrier rates of pathogenic ARSA gene mutations: is metachromatic leukodystrophy underdiagnosed? || Adolescent Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Cerebroside-Sulfatase Cohort Studies Female Genetic Testing Genetics, Population Heterozygote Humans Leukodystrophy, Metachromatic Male Middle Aged Mutation Poland Prevalence Young Adult || Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a severe neurometabolic disease caused mainly by deficiency of arylsulfatase A encoded by the ARSA gene. Based on epidemiological surveys the incidence of MLD per 100,000 live births varied from 0.6 to 2.5. Our purpose was to estimate the birth prevalence of MLD in Poland by determining population frequency of the common pathogenic ARSA gene mutations and to compare this estimate with epidemiological data. We studied two independently ascertained cohorts from the Polish background population (N∼3000 each) and determined carrier rates of common ARSA gene mutations: c.459+1G>A, p.P426L, p.I179S (cohort 1) and c.459+1G>A, p.I179S (cohort 2). Taking into account ARSA gene mutation distribution among 60 Polish patients, the expected MLD birth prevalence in the general population (assuming no selection against homozygous fetuses) was estimated as 4.0/100,000 and 4.1/100,000, respectively for the 1(st) and the 2(nd) cohort with a pooled estimate of 4.1/100,000 (CI: 1.8-9.4) which was higher than the estimate of 0.38 per 100,000 live births based on diagnosed cases. The p.I179S mutation was relatively more prevalent among controls than patients (OR = 3.6, P = 0.0082, for a comparison of p.I179S frequency relative to c.459+1G>A between controls vs. patients). The observed discrepancy between the measured incidence of metachromatic leukodystrophy and the predicted carriage rates suggests that MLD is substantially underdiagnosed in the Polish population. The underdiagnosis rate may be particularly high among patients with p.I179S mutation whose disease is characterized mainly by psychotic symptoms.	4
Mutation spectrum of PAH gene in phenylketonuria patients in Northwest China: identification of twenty novel variants. ||  || This study was performed to analyze the mutational spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Northwest China, to identify mutational hot spots, and to determine the correlation between variants and clinical phenotypes of PKU. A large cohort of 475 PKU families in Northwest China was enrolled to analyze PAH gene variants using Sanger sequencing, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and gap-PCR. Bioinformatics software was used to predict the pathogenicity of novel variants and analyze the correlations between PAH gene variants and phenotypes of PKU patients. A total of 895 variants were detected in the 950 alleles of 475 patients with PKU (detection rate: 94.21%), 20 of which were novel variants. Other 108, previously known variants, were also identified, with the three most frequent variants being p.Arg243Gln (14.00%), c.611A > G (5.58%), and p.Tyr356* (4.95%). Seven different large deletion/duplication variants were identified by the MLPA method, including the large deletion c.-4163_-406del3758 with high frequency. A correlation analysis between patient phenotype and gene variant frequency showed that p.Arg53His and p.Gln419Arg were correlated with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). In conclusion, the mutational spectrum underlying PKU in Northwest China was established for the first time. Functional analysis of 20 novel PAH gene variants enriched the PAH gene mutational spectrum. Correlation analysis between variants frequencies in compound heterozygous patients and phenotype severity is helpful for phenotypic prediction.	1 3
A premature infant with Costello syndrome due to a rare G13C HRAS mutation. || DNA Developmental Disabilities Female Genes, ras Humans Infant, Newborn Infant, Premature Intellectual Disability Male Mutation Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques Pregnancy Syndrome || Costello syndrome is caused by mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene whose clinical features in the first year of life include fetal and neonatal macrosomia with subsequent growth impairment due to severe feeding difficulties. We report on a premature male with Costello syndrome due to a rare G13C HRAS mutation and describe his clinical features and evolution during the first year of life. The diagnosis of Costello syndrome may be difficult at birth, especially in very preterm infants in whom feeding difficulties, reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue and failure to thrive are also part of their typical presentation.	4
Proteome-wide analysis of mutant p53 targets in breast cancer identifies new levels of gain-of-function that influence PARP, PCNA, and MCM4. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Death Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Chromatin Cytoplasm DNA Replication Enzyme Inhibitors Female Humans Isotope Labeling Mevalonic Acid Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 4 Mutant Proteins Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen Protein Stability Protein Transport Proteome Proteomics Signal Transduction Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The gain-of-function mutant p53 (mtp53) transcriptome has been studied, but, to date, no detailed analysis of the mtp53-associated proteome has been described. We coupled cell fractionation with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and inducible knockdown of endogenous mtp53 to determine the mtp53-driven proteome. Our fractionation data highlight the underappreciated biology that missense mtp53 proteins R273H, R280K, and L194F are tightly associated with chromatin. Using SILAC coupled to tandem MS, we identified that R273H mtp53 expression in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells up- and down-regulated multiple proteins and metabolic pathways. Here we provide the data set obtained from sequencing 73,154 peptide pairs that then corresponded to 3,010 proteins detected under reciprocal labeling conditions. Importantly, the high impact regulated targets included the previously identified transcriptionally regulated mevalonate pathway proteins but also identified two new levels of mtp53 protein regulation for nontranscriptional targets. Interestingly, mtp53 depletion profoundly influenced poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) localization, with increased cytoplasmic and decreased chromatin-associated protein. An enzymatic PARP shift occurred with high mtp53 expression, resulting in increased poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins in the nucleus. Mtp53 increased the level of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and minichromosome maintenance 4 (MCM4) proteins without changing the amount of pcna and mcm4 transcripts. Pathway enrichment analysis ranked the DNA replication pathway above the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as a R273H mtp53 activated proteomic target. Knowledge of the proteome diversity driven by mtp53 suggests that DNA replication and repair pathways are major targets of mtp53 and highlights consideration of combination chemotherapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol biosynthesis and PARP inhibition.	0
Exploration of molecular genetic etiology for Korean cochlear implantees with severe to profound hearing loss and its implication. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Cochlear Implantation Connexins Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Testing Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Republic of Korea Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || Severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) requires cochlear implantation (CI) for auditory rehabilitation. Etiologic diagnoses can contribute to candidacy selection and decision-making regarding the timing of successful CI. However, few studies have been performed to address the etiologic spectrum of severe SNHL in the population where there is no consanguineous marriage and the majority of SNHL cases are sporadic in small sized families. The authors sought to comprehensively understand the etiologies of Korean cochlear implantees by incorporating the targeted resequencing of 204 candidate deafness genes (TRS-204) and a phenotype-driven candidate gene approach. Ninety-three that consented to molecular genetic testing and underwent at least one molecular genetic test were included. Patients with a characteristic Phenotypic marker were subject to Sanger sequencing to detect variants in corresponding candidate genes. The rest of patients without any prominent phenotype were tested on GJB2. Next, TRS-204 was applied in GJB2-negative cases without any phenotypic marker. In addition, the sibling recurrence-risk of SNHL among families with non-diagnostic genotypes after TRS-204 was performed to gain insight of etiologies in non-diagnostic cases. Overall, we could find causative variants in 51 (54.8%) of the 93 cochlear implantees. Thirty (32.3%) probands could be diagnosed by direct Sanger sequencing of candidate genes selected by their phenotypes. GJB2 sequencing added 10 subjects to the group with a diagnostic genotype. TRS-204 could detect a causative variant from additional 11 cases (11.8%). We could not detect any pathogenic deletion or duplication on 204 target genes. The sibling recurrence-risk of SNHL among 42 genetically undiagnosed families with 0.03 (1/38) was significantly lower than among genetically diagnosed recessive families with 0.19 (7/37). Despite that the majority of severe or more degree of SNHL occurs sporadically in Koreans, at least 54.8% of such cases that were willing to join the genetic study in the Korean population are monogenic Mendelian disorders with convincing causative variants. This study also indicates that a substantial portion of unsolved cases after applying our current protocol are predicted to have non-genetic or complex etiology rather than a Mendelian genetic disorder involving new genes beyond the 204 target genes.	4
JAK2V617F and p53 mutations coexist in erythroleukemia and megakaryoblastic leukemic cell lines. ||  || JAK2V617F, a gain-of-function mutant form of tyrosine kinase JAK2, is found in the majority of patients with Ph- myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a group of chronic hematological diseases that often lead to acute leukemia. The current study is intended to find other gene mutations that collaborate with JAK2V617F to cause leukemic transformation. Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from two JAK2V617F-positive cell lines, namely, erythroleukemic HEL and megakaryoblastic leukemic SET-2 cells. Candidate genes were amplified by PCR and further sequenced. Homozygous mutations of the TP53 gene which encodes tumor suppressor p53 were found in HEL and SET-2 cells. While HEL cells, which have homozygous JAK2V617F, contain a rare M133K p53 mutation, SET-2 cells, which have a heterozygous JAK2V617F mutation, contain a common R248W p53 alteration. Western blot analyses revealed high levels of p53 expression in both cells. M133K and R248W are located in the DNA binding domain of p53. Structural analyses revealed that they potentially disrupt the interaction of p53 with DNA, thereby causing loss of p53 function. JAK2V617F and p53 mutations coexist in leukemia cells. We believe that JAK2V617F is able to drive leukemic transformation when the function of tumor suppressor p53 is lost. The interplay of JAK2V617F with p53 may affect the progression of MPNs.	0
Predicting the Functional Impact of CDH1 Missense Mutations in Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer. || Antigens, CD Cadherins Cell Adhesion Cell Movement Genetic Counseling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Heterozygote Humans Mutation, Missense Stomach Neoplasms || The role of E-cadherin in Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) is unequivocal. Germline alterations in its encoding gene (CDH1) are causative of HDGC and occur in about 40% of patients. Importantly, while in most casesCDH1 alterations result in the complete loss of E-cadherin associated with a well-established clinical impact, in about 20% of cases the mutations are of the missense type. The latter are of particular concern in terms of genetic counselling and clinical management, as the effect of the sequence variants in E-cadherin function is not predictable. If a deleterious variant is identified, prophylactic surgery could be recommended. Therefore, over the last few years, intensive research has focused on evaluating the functional consequences ofCDH1 missense variants and in assessing E-cadherin pathogenicity. In that context, our group has contributed to better characterizeCDH1 germline missense variants and is now considered a worldwide reference centre. In this review, we highlight the state of the art methodologies to categorizeCDH1 variants, as neutral or deleterious. This information is subsequently integrated with clinical data for genetic counseling and management ofCDH1 variant carriers.	4
Risks at the DNA Replication Fork: Effects upon Carcinogenesis and Tumor Heterogeneity. ||  || The ability of all organisms to copy their genetic information via DNA replication is a prerequisite for cell division and a biological imperative of life. In multicellular organisms, however, mutations arising from DNA replication errors in the germline and somatic cells are the basis of genetic diseases and cancer, respectively. Within human tumors, replication errors additionally contribute to mutator phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity, which are major confounding factors for cancer therapeutics. Successful DNA replication involves the coordination of many large-scale, complex cellular processes. In this review, we focus on the roles that defects in enzymes that normally act at the replication fork and dysregulation of enzymes that inappropriately damage single-stranded DNA at the fork play in causing mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. We focus on tumor data and experimental evidence that error-prone variants of replicative polymerases promote carcinogenesis and on research indicating that the primary target mutated by APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminases is ssDNA present at the replication fork. Furthermore, we discuss evidence from model systems that indicate replication stress and other cancer-associated metabolic changes may modulate mutagenic enzymatic activities at the replication fork.	0
Estimation of the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia in a rural Afrikaner community by direct screening for three Afrikaner founder low density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations. || Adolescent Adult Age Factors Cholesterol Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Female Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Middle Aged Mutation Myocardial Ischemia Netherlands Prevalence Receptors, LDL Risk Factors Rural Population Sex Characteristics South Africa Triglycerides || We have determined the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in a rural Afrikaner community by means of direct DNA screening for three founder-related Afrikaner low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene mutations. A random sample of 1612 persons, aged 15-64 years, was selected as a subsample of 4583 subjects from an Afrikaner community living in the south-western Cape, South Africa. Participants who had a total serum cholesterol (TC) in the high TC category as defined in the consensus recommendations by the Southern African Heart Foundation, were screened for three founder-related LDL receptor gene mutations, causing FH in 90% of Afrikaners. Of the subsample, 201 participants (12.5%) had TC levels above the 80th percentile. In this group the combined prevalence of the three common Afrikaner LDL receptor gene defects (D206E, FH Afrikaner-1; V408M, FH Afrikaner-2; D154N, FH Afrikaner-3) was calculated as 1: 83. When taking into account the reported background prevalence of other FH gene defects of 1:500 in this community, their overall prevalence of FH was estimated to be 1:72. The significant differences found between the FH patients and other high risk patients with raised cholesterol levels were higher TC and LDL cholesterol levels and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in FH patients. The treatment status of the molecularly identified FH patients and other hypercholesterolaemic persons suggests that this condition is inadequately diagnosed and poorly managed in this study population. An extrapolation to the entire South African population suggests that there are about 112000 FH patients in the country who are under-diagnosed as a group and therefore not receiving the care that would help to reduce the burden of FH-associated ischaemic heart disease in South Africa.	4
Audiometric evaluation of carriers of the connexin 26 mutation 35delG. || Adult Audiometry Auditory Threshold Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Genotype Hearing Heterozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Phenotype Point Mutation Severity of Illness Index || Mutation in a gap junction protein gene (GJB2 also named connexin 26) is a major cause of autosomal recessive congenital deafness, which is responsible for about 80% of the cases in Mediterranean families, but actually little is known about the influence of GJB2 mutations on the hearing of obligate carriers. We examined GJB2 35delG mutation carrier individuals to test the possible presence and incidence of audiometric abnormalities among carriers of 35delG mutations. Tonal audiometric analysis was performed on a 35delG mutation carrier group (H) and on a non-carrier control group (N). Audiometric evaluations in the control group showed the presence of thresholds within normal limits at all frequencies, while carriers of 35delG mutations presented a decrease of hearing principally at 6,000 and 8,000 Hz. The difference at 6,000 and 8,000 Hz between groups H and N is statistically significant.	4
All-codon scanning identifies p53 cancer rescue mutations. || Amino Acid Substitution Base Sequence Cell Line Codon Gene Library Genes, Neoplasm Genes, p53 Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction || In vitro scanning mutagenesis strategies are valuable tools to identify critical residues in proteins and to generate proteins with modified properties. We describe the fast and simple All-Codon Scanning (ACS) strategy that creates a defined gene library wherein each individual codon within a specific target region is changed into all possible codons with only a single codon change per mutagenesis product. ACS is based on a multiplexed overlapping mutagenesis primer design that saturates only the targeted gene region with single codon changes. We have used ACS to produce single amino-acid changes in small and large regions of the human tumor suppressor protein p53 to identify single amino-acid substitutions that can restore activity to inactive p53 found in human cancers. Single-tube reactions were used to saturate defined 30-nt regions with all possible codon changes. The same technique was used in 20 parallel reactions to scan the 600-bp fragment encoding the entire p53 core domain. Identification of several novel p53 cancer rescue mutations demonstrated the utility of the ACS approach. ACS is a fast, simple and versatile method, which is useful for protein structure-function analyses and protein design or evolution problems.	0
Tumor suppressor p53 and its mutants in cancer metabolism. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Cellular Senescence Energy Metabolism Fatty Acids Glycolysis Humans Mitochondria Mutation Neoplasms Oxidative Phosphorylation Pentose Phosphate Pathway Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor-suppressor p53 plays a key role in tumor prevention. As a transcription factor, p53 transcriptionally regulates its target genes to initiate different biological processes in response to stress, including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or senescence, to exert its function in tumor suppression. Recent studies have revealed that metabolic regulation is a novel function of p53. Metabolic changes have been regarded as a hallmark of tumors and a key contributor to tumor development. p53 regulates many different aspects of metabolism, including glycolysis, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, to maintain the homeostasis of cellular metabolism, which contributes to the role of p53 in tumor suppression. p53 is frequently mutated in human tumors. In addition to loss of tumor suppressive function, tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins often gain new tumorigenic activities, termed gain-of-function of mutant p53. Recent studies have shown that mutant p53 mediates metabolic changes in tumors as a novel gain-of-function to promote tumor development. Here we review the functions and mechanisms of wild-type and mutant p53 in metabolic regulation, and discuss their potential roles in tumorigenesis.	0
Overcoming MITF-conferred drug resistance through dual AURKA/MAPK targeting in human melanoma cells. || Apoptosis Aurora Kinase A Azepines Cell Line, Tumor Drug Resistance, Neoplasm GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Melanoma Membrane Proteins Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Pyrimidines Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) is a frequently amplified lineage-specific oncogene in human melanoma, whose role in intrinsic drug resistance has not been systematically investigated. Utilizing chemical inhibitors for major signaling pathways/cellular processes, we witness MITF as an elicitor of intrinsic drug resistance. To search kinase(s) targets able to bypass MITF-conferred drug resistance, we employed a multi-kinase inhibitor-directed chemical proteomics-based differential affinity screen in human melanocytes carrying ectopic MITF overexpression. A subsequent methodical interrogation informed mitotic Ser/Thr kinase Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) as a crucial regulator of melanoma cell proliferation and migration, independent of the underlying molecular alterations, including TP53 functional status and MITF levels. Crucially, assessing the efficacy of investigational AURKA inhibitor MLN8237, we pre-emptively witness the procurement of a molecular program consistent with acquired drug resistance. This involved induction of multiple MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway components and their downstream proliferation effectors (Cyclin D1 and c-JUN) and apoptotic regulators (MITF and Bcl-2). A concomitant AURKA/BRAF and AURKA/MEK targeting overcame MAPK signaling activation-associated resistance signature in BRAF- and NRAS-mutated melanomas, respectively, and elicited heightened anti-proliferative activity and apoptotic cell death. These findings reveal a previously unreported MAPK signaling-mediated mechanism of immediate resistance to AURKA inhibitors. These findings could bear significant implications for the application and the success of anti-AURKA approaches that have already entered phase-II clinical trials for human melanoma.	0
Familial ebstein anomaly, left ventricular hypertrabeculation, and ventricular septal defect associated with a MYH7 mutation. || Ebstein anomaly MYH7 gene familial Ebstein anomaly left ventricular hypertrabeculation ventricular septal defect || Ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital heart defect that most often occurs sporadically within a kindred. Familial cases, although reported, are uncommon. At this time, the genetic etiology of Ebstein anomaly is not fully elucidated. Here, we describe clinical and molecular investigations of a rare case of familial Ebstein anomaly in association with a likely pathogenic mutation of the MYH7 gene. The severity of presentation varies, and Ebstein anomaly can be observed in association with such other heart defects as ventricular septal defect and left ventricular (LV) hypertrabeculation, as seen in our family of study. In our family of study, the 31-year-old father and four of his children have been diagnosed with Ebstein anomaly. Genetic testing revealed that the father was heterozygous for the Glu1220del variant detected in exon 27 of the MYH7 gene. The MYH7 gene encodes the β-myosin heavy chain and is expressed in cardiac muscle. DNA sequencing of three of his affected children confirmed that they carried the same variant while the fourth affected child was not available for testing. This is the first report of familial Ebstein anomaly associated with the Glu1220del mutation of the MYH7 gene. The mutation segregates with disease in a family with autosomal dominant transmission of congenital heart defects including Ebstein anomaly and other associated cardiovascular defects including LV hypertrabeculation and ventricular septal defect.	4
Specific cancer-associated mutations in the switch III region of Ras increase tumorigenicity by nanocluster augmentation. || Animals Cell Line Cell Membrane Cell Proliferation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Humans Mutation Neoplasms Protein Multimerization Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Hotspot mutations of Ras drive cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Less frequent mutations in Ras are poorly characterized for their oncogenic potential. Yet insight into their mechanism of action may point to novel opportunities to target Ras. Here, we show that several cancer-associated mutations in the switch III region moderately increase Ras activity in all isoforms. Mutants are biochemically inconspicuous, while their clustering into nanoscale signaling complexes on the plasma membrane, termed nanocluster, is augmented. Nanoclustering dictates downstream effector recruitment, MAPK-activity, and tumorigenic cell proliferation. Our results describe an unprecedented mechanism of signaling protein activation in cancer.	0
Genetic testing for hereditary hearing loss: connexin 26 (GJB2) allele variants and two novel deafness-causing mutations (R32C and 645-648delTAGA). ||  || Mutations in GJB2 are the most common cause of hereditary congenital hearing loss in many countries and are found in about half of persons with severe-to-profound congenital autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). We report the results of GJB2 mutation screening in 209 consecutive persons with congenital deafness of indeterminate etiology using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assay, single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, and direct sequencing. GJB2 allele variants were detected in 74 of 209 deaf individuals (35%). Over one-fourth of screened individuals were either homozygous (n=31) or heterozygous (n=24) for the 35delG mutation. Of those with the 35delG mutation, 51 (92.7%) were diagnosed with GJB2-related deafness. Nineteen persons were identified with other GJB2 allele variants - two novel deafness-causing mutations (R32C, 645-648delTAGA), one mutation of unknown significance (E47K), and one benign polymorphism (I128I). While these data enable health care professionals to provide parents and patients with improved genetic counseling data, difficulty still exists is determining whether some missense mutations compromise auditory function and are deafness-causing.	4
A novel role for synaptic acetylcholinesterase as an apoptotic deoxyribonuclease. ||  || In addition to terminating neurotransmission by hydrolyzing acetylcholine, synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChES) has been found to have a pro-apoptotic role. However, the underlying mechanism has rarely been investigated. Here, we report a nuclear translocation-dependent role for AChES as an apoptotic deoxyribonuclease (DNase). AChES polypeptide binds to and cleaves naked DNA at physiological pH in a Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)-dependent manner. It also cleaves chromosomal DNA both in pre-fixed and in apoptotic cells. In the presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, the cleavage still occurred after nuclear translocation of AChES, implying that AChES-DNase acts in a CAD- and EndoG-independent manner. AChE gene knockout impairs apoptotic DNA cleavage; this impairment is rescued by overexpression of the wild-type but not (aa 32-138)-deleted AChES. Furthermore, in comparison with the nuclear-localized wild-type AChES, (aa 32-138)-deleted AChES loses the capacity to initiate apoptosis. These observations confirm that AChES mediates apoptosis via its DNase activity.	0

Prospective genetic profiling of squamous cell lung cancer and adenosquamous carcinoma in Japanese patients by multitarget assays. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Asian Continental Ancestry Group Biological Specimen Banks Carcinoma, Adenosquamous Carcinoma, Squamous Cell DNA Copy Number Variations Female Gene Expression Profiling Genotyping Techniques Humans Japan Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Grading Neoplasm Staging Prospective Studies Risk Factors || Despite considerable recent progress in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, there has been little progress in the development of efficacious molecular targeted therapies for squamous cell lung cancer. In addition to the recent comprehensive genome-wide characterization of squamous cell lung cancer, it is also important to genotype this form of cancer. We therefore conducted the Shizuoka Lung Cancer Mutation Study to analyze driver mutations in patients with thoracic malignancies. Here we report the results of genotyping in patients with squamous cell lung cancer. Based on the biobanking system, in conjunction with the clinic and pathology lab, we developed a genotyping panel designed to assess 24 mutations in 10 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, HER2 and DDR2), EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and FGFR2 copy numbers, and EML4-ALK and ROS1 translocations, using pyrosequencing plus capillary electrophoresis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcription PCR, respectively. A total of 129 patients with squamous cell lung cancer and adenosquamous carcinoma were enrolled in this study between July 2011 and November 2012. We detected genetic alterations in 40% of all cases. Gene alterations included: EGFR mutations, 6%; KRAS mutations, 4%; PIK3CA mutations, 13%; NRAS mutations, 1%; KIF5b-RET fusion gene, 1%; EGFR copy number gain, 5%; PIK3CA copy number gain, 15%; and FGFR1 copy number gain, 5%. Twelve patients (9%) harbored simultaneous genetic alterations. Genetic alterations were detected more frequently in surgically-resected, snap-frozen samples than in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples (50% vs. 29%). In addition, patients aged ≤70 years old and never-smokers showed high frequencies of genetic alterations. This study represents one of the largest prospective tumor-genotyping studies to be performed in Asian patients with squamous cell lung cancer. These results suggest that incorporation of genetic profiling into lung cancer clinical practice may facilitate the administration of personalized cancer treatments in patients with squamous cell lung cancer.	4
Clinical Genotyping of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers Using Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing: Utility of Identifying Rare and Co-mutations in Oncogenic Driver Genes. || Alleles Biopsy Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Female Gene Expression Profiling High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasms, Multiple Primary Oncogenes || Detection of somatic mutations in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), especially adenocarcinomas, is important for directing patient care when targeted therapy is available. Here, we present our experience with genotyping NSCLC using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. We tested 453 NSCLC samples from 407 individual patients using the 50 gene AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 from May 2013 to July 2015. Using 10 ng of DNA, up to 11 samples were simultaneously sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM (316 and 318 chips). We identified variants with the Ion Torrent Variant Caller Plugin, and Golden Helix's SVS software was used for annotation and prediction of the significance of the variants. Three hundred ninety-eight samples were successfully sequenced (12.1% failure rate). In all, 633 variants in 41 genes were detected with a median of 2 (range of 0 to 7) variants per sample. Mutations detected in BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA were considered potentially actionable and were identified in 237 samples, most commonly in KRAS (37.9%), EGFR (11.1%), BRAF (4.8%), and PIK3CA (4.3%). In our patient population, all mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF were mutually exclusive. The Ion Torrent Ampliseq technology can be utilized on small biopsy and cytology specimens, requires very little input DNA, and can be applied in clinical laboratories for genotyping of NSCLC. This targeted next-generation sequencing approach allows for detection of common and also rare mutations that are clinically actionable in multiple patients simultaneously.	4
Investigation of the mtDNA mutations in Syrian families with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool DNA, Mitochondrial Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Syria || Hearing loss is a common sensory disorder, and at least 50% of cases are due to a genetic etiology. Several mitochondrial DNA mutations (mtDNA) have been reported to be associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in different population. However, There is no previous available data about the frequency of mtDNA mutations as etiology for deafness in Syrian. The aim of present study is to investigate the incidence of common mt DNA mutations in our families with congenital hearing loss and not related to the ototoxicity or aminoglycosides. A total of 50 deaf families were enrolled in the present study. Direct sequencing and PCR-RFLP methods were employed to detect seven mt DNA mutations, including A1555G, A3243G, C1494T, G3316A, T7510C, A7445G, and 7472insC. Our results revealed a high prevalence of mt DNA mutation (10%) in deaf families (5/50). In surprising, the unexpected mutations were observed. The G3316A mutation was found in 2 families as homoplasmic genotype. Also, we found the homoplasmic and heteroplasmic genotype for the C1494T mutation in two families. In one family the heteroplasmic genotype for T7510C mutation was observed; this family harbor 35delG mutation in GJB2 gene. None of the common mtDNA mutations (A1555G, A3243G) and other mutations (A7445G, 7472insC) were detected here. Our findings indicate to significant contribution of the mt DNA mutations in our families with NSHL. The presented data is the first report about mt DNA and it will improve the genetic counseling of hearing impaired in Syrian families.	4
Histone deacetylase inhibitors suppress mutant p53 transcription via histone deacetylase 8. || Cell Line, Tumor Gene Knockdown Techniques Genes, p53 Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Histone Deacetylases Homeodomain Proteins Humans Hydroxamic Acids Mutation Repressor Proteins Transcription, Genetic Vorinostat || Mutation of the p53 gene is the most common genetic alteration in human cancer and contributes to malignant process by enhancing transformed properties of cells and resistance to anticancer therapy. Mutant p53 is often highly expressed in tumor cells at least, in part, due to its increased half-life. However, whether mutant p53 expression is regulated by other mechanisms in tumors is unclear. Here we found that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors suppress both wild-type and mutant p53 transcription in time- and dose-dependent manners. Consistent with this, the levels of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins are decreased upon treatment with HDAC inhibitors. Importantly, we found that upon knockdown of each class I HDAC, only HDAC8 knockdown leads to decreased expression of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins and transcripts. Conversely, we found that ectopic expression of wild-type, but not mutant HDAC8, leads to increased transcription of p53. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of HDAC8 results in reduced expression of HoxA5 and consequently, attenuated ability of HoxA5 to activate p53 transcription, which can be rescued by ectopic expression of HoxA5. Because of the fact that HDAC8 is required for expression of both wild-type and mutant p53, we found that targeted disruption of HDAC8 expression remarkably triggers proliferative defect in cells with a mutant, but not wild-type, p53. Together, our data uncover a regulatory mechanism of mutant p53 transcription via HDAC8 and suggest that HDAC inhibitors and especially HDAC8-targeting agents might be explored as an adjuvant for tumors carrying a mutant p53.	0
Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of Noonan syndrome: new data and review of the literature. || Adult Child Female Gene Frequency Genotype Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Male Mutation Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases Review Literature as Topic SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases src Homology Domains || Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by short stature, minor facial anomalies, and congenital heart defects. In approximately 50% of cases the condition is caused by missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12, resulting in a gain of function of the protein SHP-2. In this study, PTPN11 mutation analysis was performed in 170 NS patients. In 76 (45%) of them a mutation was identified. We report on the distribution of these mutations, as well as on genotype-phenotype relationships. The benefit of the NS scoring system developed by van der Burgt et al. [(1994); Am J Med Genet 53:187-191] is shown, among physicians who consequently based their diagnosis on the NS scoring system the percentage mutation positive subjects was 54%, whereas this percentage was only 39% among physicians who made less use of the scoring system. In two patients with some uncommon manifestations mutations were found in the C-SH2 domain, a region in which defects are not often identified in NS. A trend was observed in patients carrying the 922A --> G change (Asn308Asp) receiving normal education. In one patient with NS and mild juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) the mutation 218C --> T (Thr73Ile) was found. This confirms previous findings indicating that individuals with NS with specific mutations in PTPN11 are at risk of developing JMML.	4
Human pluripotent stem cells recurrently acquire and expand dominant negative P53 mutations. || Alleles Cell Count Cell Differentiation Cell Division Cell Line DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Exome Genes, Dominant Genes, p53 Human Embryonic Stem Cells Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Loss of Heterozygosity Mosaicism Mutation Neoplasms Protein Domains Selection, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Human pluripotent stem cells (hPS cells) can self-renew indefinitely, making them an attractive source for regenerative therapies. This expansion potential has been linked with the acquisition of large copy number variants that provide mutated cells with a growth advantage in culture. The nature, extent and functional effects of other acquired genome sequence mutations in cultured hPS cells are not known. Here we sequence the protein-coding genes (exomes) of 140 independent human embryonic stem cell (hES cell) lines, including 26 lines prepared for potential clinical use. We then apply computational strategies for identifying mutations present in a subset of cells in each hES cell line. Although such mosaic mutations were generally rare, we identified five unrelated hES cell lines that carried six mutations in the TP53 gene that encodes the tumour suppressor P53. The TP53 mutations we observed are dominant negative and are the mutations most commonly seen in human cancers. We found that the TP53 mutant allelic fraction increased with passage number under standard culture conditions, suggesting that the P53 mutations confer selective advantage. We then mined published RNA sequencing data from 117 hPS cell lines, and observed another nine TP53 mutations, all resulting in coding changes in the DNA-binding domain of P53. In three lines, the allelic fraction exceeded 50%, suggesting additional selective advantage resulting from the loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus. As the acquisition and expansion of cancer-associated mutations in hPS cells may go unnoticed during most applications, we suggest that careful genetic characterization of hPS cells and their differentiated derivatives be carried out before clinical use.	0
Screening mutations in myosin binding protein C3 gene in a cohort of patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. || Adult Alternative Splicing Amino Acid Substitution Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Carrier State Cohort Studies Family Genotype Homozygote Humans Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational || MyBPC3 mutations are amongst the most frequent causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, however, its prevalence varies between populations. They have been associated with mild and late onset disease expression. Our objectives were to establish the prevalence of MyBPC3 mutations and determine their associated clinical characteristics in our patients. Screening by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphisms (SSCP) and sequencing of the fragments with abnormal motility of the MyBPC3 gene in 130 unrelated consecutive HCM index cases. Genotype-Phenotype correlation studies were done in positive families. 16 mutations were found in 20 index cases (15%): 5 novel [D75N, V471E, Q327fs, IVS6+5G>A (homozygous), and IVS11-9G>A] and 11 previously described [A216T, R495W, R502Q (2 families), E542Q (3 families), T957S, R1022P (2 families), E1179K, K504del, K600fs, P955fs and IVS29+5G>A]. Maximum wall thickness and age at time of diagnosis were similar to patients with MYH7 mutations [25(7) vs. 27(8), p = 0.16], [46(16) vs. 44(19), p = 0.9]. Mutations in MyBPC3 are present in 15% of our hypertrophic cardiomyopathy families. Severe hypertrophy and early expression are compatible with the presence of MyBPC3 mutations. The genetic diagnosis not only allows avoiding clinical follow up of non carriers but it opens new possibilities that includes: to take preventive clinical decisions in mutation carriers than have not developed the disease yet, the establishment of genotype-phenotype relationship, and to establish a genetic diagnosis routine in patients with familial HCM.	4
Centrosome amplification arises before neoplasia and increases upon p53 loss in tumorigenesis. ||  || Centrosome abnormalities are a typical hallmark of human cancers. However, the origin and dynamics of such abnormalities in human cancer are not known. In this study, we examined centrosomes in Barrett's esophagus tumorigenesis, a well-characterized multistep pathway of progression, from the premalignant condition to the metastatic disease. This human cancer model allows the study of sequential steps of progression within the same patient and has representative cell lines from all stages of disease. Remarkably, centrosome amplification was detected as early as the premalignant condition and was significantly expanded in dysplasia. It was then present throughout malignant transformation both in adenocarcinoma and metastasis. The early expansion of centrosome amplification correlated with and was dependent on loss of function of the tumor suppressor p53 both through loss of wild-type expression and hotspot mutations. Our work shows that centrosome amplification in human tumorigenesis can occur before transformation, being repressed by p53. These findings suggest centrosome amplification in humans can contribute to tumor initiation and progression.	0

Such tumors in adrenal glands are usually of neuroendocrine-neural type and occur mostly in adults. Their pathogenesis remains elusive. We report a patient with composite neuroblastoma (NB), adrenocortical tumor (ACT), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) with germline TP53 R248W mutation. LFS predisposes to the development of leukemia, sarcomas, adrenocortical and breast carcinomas, brain tumors and, questionably, NB. A unique correlation between a single TP53 mutation (R337H) and ACT has been reported in southern Brazilian children. It remains unclear at this time whether a similar association of NB and R248W in patients with LFS exists.	4
Frequencies of phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations I65T, R252W, R261Q, R261X, IVS10nt11, V388M, R408W, Y414C, and IVS12nt1 in Minas Gerais, Brazil. || Brazil Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel Genetic Testing Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation Neonatal Screening Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || In order to determine the phenylketonuria (PKU) mutation spectrum in the population of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, 78 unrelated PKU patients found by the neonatal screening program from 1993 to 2003 were tested for nine phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations. These mutations were selected due to their high frequencies in other Brazilian populations and in Portugal, where the largest contingent of the Caucasian component of the Brazilian population originated from. The most frequent mutations were V388M (21%), R261Q (16%), IVS10nt11 (13.4%), I65T (5.7%), and R252W (5%). The frequencies of the other four mutations (R261X, R408W, Y414C, and IVS12nt1) did not reach 2%. By testing these nine mutations, we were able to identify 64% of the PKU alleles in our sample. V388M frequency was higher than in any other known population and almost three times larger than that observed in Portugal, probably reflecting genetic drift. The mutation profile, as well as the relative frequency of the different mutations, suggest that the Minas Gerais population more closely resembles that of Portugal than do the other Brazilian populations that have already been tested.	1 3
Optimization to detect TP53 mutations in circulating cell-free tumor DNA from patients with serous epithelial ovarian cancer. ||  || Circulating cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) is the DNA released by apoptotic and necrotic cells of the primary tumor into the blood during the period of tumor development. The cfDNA reflects the genetic and epigenetic alterations of the original tumor. TP53 mutations are a defining feature of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. We optimized the methods for detecting TP53 mutations in cfDNA from blood samples. We confirmed the correlation of TP53 mutation in primary ovarian cancer tissue and it in cfDNA using digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR). We found 12 frequent mutation sites in TP53 using The Cancer Genome Atlas and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer data and manufactured 12 primers. The mutations in tissues were evaluated in fresh-frozen tissue (FFT) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET). We performed a prospective analysis of serial plasma samples collected from 4 patients before debulking surgery. We extracted cfDNA and calculated its concentration in blood. dPCR was used to analyze TP53 mutations in cfDNA, and we compared TP53 mutations in ovarian cancer tissue with those in cfDNA. Ten primers out of 12 detected the presence of TP53 mutations in FFT, FFPET, and cfDNA. In FFT and FFPET tissue, there were no significant differences. The average cfDNA concentration was 2.12±0.59 ng/mL. We also confirmed that mutations of cfDNA and those of FFT were all in R282W site. This study developed detection methods for TP53 mutations in cfDNA in ovarian cancer patients using dPCR. The results demonstrated that there are the same TP53 mutations in both ovarian cancer tissue and cfDNA.	4
Allele-specific differences in ryanodine receptor 1 mRNA expression levels may contribute to phenotypic variability in malignant hyperthermia. || Cell Line Cells, Cultured Humans Malignant Hyperthermia Muscle, Skeletal Phenotype RNA Stability RNA, Messenger Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel || Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a dominantly inherited skeletal muscle disorder that can cause a fatal hypermetabolic reaction to general anaesthetics. The primary locus of MH (MHS1 locus) in humans is linked to chromosome 19q13.1, the position of the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RyR1). In this study, an inexpensive allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) assay was designed that allowed the relative quantification of the two RyR1 transcripts in heterozygous samples found to be susceptible to MH (MHS). Allele-specific differences in RyR1 expression levels can provide insight into the observed variable penetrance and variations in MH phenotypes between individuals. The presence/absence of the H4833Y mutation in RYR1 transcripts was employed as a marker that allowed discrimination between the two alleles. In four skeletal muscle samples and two lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from different MHS patients, the wild type allele was found to be expressed at higher levels than the mutant RyR1 allele. For both LCLs, the ratios between the wild type and mutant RYR1 alleles did not change after different incubation times with actinomycin D. This suggests that there are no allele-specific differences in RyR1 mRNA stability, at least in these cells. The data presented here revealed for the first time allele-specific differences in RYR1 mRNA expression levels in heterozygous MHS samples, and can at least in part contribute to the observed variable penetrance and variations in MH clinical phenotypes.	0
Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing of Plasma DNA from Cancer Patients: Factors Influencing Consistency with Tumour DNA and Prospective Investigation of Its Utility for Diagnosis. || Biopsy DNA, Neoplasm High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Melanoma Mutation Neoplasms Prospective Studies Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction || Use of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) as a liquid biopsy has been proposed for potential identification and monitoring of solid tumours. We investigate a next-generation sequencing approach for mutation detection in ctDNA in two related studies using a targeted panel. The first study was retrospective, using blood samples taken from melanoma patients at diverse timepoints before or after treatment, aiming to evaluate correlation between mutations identified in biopsy and ctDNA, and to acquire a first impression of influencing factors. We found good concordance between ctDNA and tumour mutations of melanoma patients when blood samples were collected within one year of biopsy or before treatment. In contrast, when ctDNA was sequenced after targeted treatment in melanoma, mutations were no longer found in 9 out of 10 patients, suggesting the method might be useful for detecting treatment response. Building on these findings, we focused the second study on ctDNA obtained before biopsy in lung patients, i.e. when a tentative diagnosis of lung cancer had been made, but no treatment had started. The main objective of this prospective study was to evaluate use of ctDNA in diagnosis, investigating the concordance of biopsy and ctDNA-derived mutation detection. Here we also found positive correlation between diagnostic lung biopsy results and pre-biopsy ctDNA sequencing, providing support for using ctDNA as a cost-effective, non-invasive solution when the tumour is inaccessible or when biopsy poses significant risk to the patient.	4
Clonal evolution in therapy-related neoplasms. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Clonal Evolution Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms, Second Primary || Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) may occur as a late effect of cytotoxic therapy for a primary malignancy or autoimmune diseases in susceptible individuals. We studied the development of somatic mutations in t-MN, using a collection of follow-up samples from 14 patients with a primary hematologic malignancy, who developed a secondary leukemia (13 t-MN and 1 t-acute lymphoblastic leukemia), at a median latency of 73 months (range 18-108) from primary cancer diagnosis.Using Sanger and next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches we identified 8 mutations (IDH1 R132H, ASXL1 Y591*, ASXL1 S689*, ASXL1 R693*, SRSF2 P95H, SF3B1 K700E, SETBP1 G870R and TP53 Y220C) in seven of thirteen t-MN patients (54%), whereas the t-ALL patient had a t(4,11) translocation, resulting in the KMT2A/AFF1 fusion gene. These mutations were then tracked backwards in marrow samples preceding secondary leukemia occurrence, using pyrosequencing and a NGS protocol that allows the detection of low variant allele frequencies (≥0.1%).Somatic mutations were detectable in the BM harvested at the primary diagnosis, prior to any cytotoxic treatment in three patients, while they were not detectable and apparently acquired by the t-MN clone in five patients.These data show that clonal evolution in t-MN is heterogeneous, with some somatic mutations preceding cytotoxic treatment and possibly favoring leukemic development.	4
Characterization of a novel POLD1 missense founder mutation in a Spanish population. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis DNA Polymerase III European Continental Ancestry Group Female Founder Effect Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetics, Population Germ-Line Mutation Haplotypes Heterozygote Humans Male Microsatellite Repeats Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Penetrance Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Population Surveillance Spain Young Adult || We identified a new and a recurrent POLD1 mutation associated with predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC). We characterized the molecular and clinical nature of the potential POLD1 founder mutation in families from Valencia (Spain). Clinical and molecular data were collected from four independent families known to have a POLD1 Leu474Pro mutation. To establish its founder effect, haplotype construction was performed using 14 flanking POLD1 polymorphic markers. We calculated penetrance estimates and clinical expressivity, globally and stratified by age and sex. We included 32 individuals from the four families: 20 carriers and 12 noncarriers. A common haplotype was identified in these families in a region comprising 2,995 Mb, confirming L474P as the first founder POLD1 mutation identified. Thirteen tumors diagnosed in 10 POLD1 carriers: eight CRC, three endometrial and two other tumors were considered. The median age of cancer onset for POLD1 mutation carriers was 48 years. The observed penetrance was 50% and the cumulative risk at age of 50 years was 30%. The findings of the present study contribute to a better understanding of CRC genetics in the Spanish population. The clinical phenotype for this mutation is similar to that in Lynch syndrome. Future studies using next generation sequencing with large gene panels for any hereditary cancer condition will offer the possibility of detecting POLE/POLD1 mutations in unsuspected clinical situations, demonstrating a more real and unbiased picture of the associated phenotype.	4
The myosin mesa and a possible unifying hypothesis for the molecular basis of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Myosins Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs || No matter how many times one explores the structure of the myosin molecule, there is always something new to discover. Here, I describe the myosin mesa, a structural feature of the motor domain that has the characteristics of a binding domain for another protein, possibly myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). Interestingly, many well-known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations lie along this surface and may affect the putative interactions proposed here. A potential unifying hypothesis for the molecular basis of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is discussed here. It involves increased power output of the cardiac muscle as a result of HCM mutations causing the release of inhibition by myosin binding protein C.	0
Expanding preconception carrier screening for the Jewish population using high throughput microfluidics technology and next generation sequencing. || Computational Biology DNA Mutational Analysis Fertilization Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Jews Lab-On-A-Chip Devices || Genetic screening to identify carriers of autosomal recessive diseases has become an integral part of routine prenatal care. In spite of the rapid growth of known mutations, most current screening programs include only a small subset of these mutations, and are performed using diverse molecular techniques, which are generally labor-intensive and time consuming. We examine the implementation of the combined high-throughput technologies of specific target amplification and next generation sequencing (NGS), for expanding the carrier screening program in the Israeli Jewish population as a test case. We compiled a panel of 370 germline mutations, causing 120 disorders, previously identified in affected Jewish individuals from different ethnicities. This mutation panel was simultaneously captured in 48 samples using a multiplex PCR-based microfluidics approach followed by NGS, thereby performing 17,760 individual assays in a single experiment. The sensitivity (measured with depth of at least 50×) and specificity of the target capture was 98 and 95 % respectively, leaving minimal rate of inconclusive tests per sample tested. 97 % of the targeted mutations present in the samples were correctly identified and validated. Our methodology was shown to successfully combine multiplexing of target specific primers, samples indexing and NGS technology for population genetic screens. Moreover, it's relatively ease of use and flexibility of updating the targets screened, makes it highly suitable for clinical implementation. This protocol was demonstrated in pre-conceptional screening for pan-Jewish individuals, but can be applied to any other population or different sets of mutations.	4
Prevalence of GJB2 mutations in prelingual deafness in the Greek population. || Base Sequence Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Testing Genotype Greece Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Pedigree Polymerase Chain Reaction Population Surveillance Prevalence || Mutations in the gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26 (GJB2) have been shown as a major contributor to prelingual, sensorineural, nonsyndromic, recessive deafness. One specific mutation, 35delG, has accounted for the majority of the mutations detected in the GJB2 gene in Caucasian populations. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence and spectrum of GJB2 mutations in prelingual deafness in the Greek population. In a collaboration with the major referral centers for childhood deafness in Greece, patients were examined by an extensive questionnaire to exclude syndromic forms and environmental causes of deafness and by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of the 35delG mutation. Patients heterozygous for the 35delG mutation were further analyzed by direct genomic sequencing of the coding region of the GJB2 gene. The 35delG mutation was found in 42.2% of the chromosomes in 45 familial cases of prelingual, nonsyndromic deafness (18 homozygotes and 2 heterozygotes) and in 30.6% of the chromosomes in 165 sporadic cases (45 homozygotes and 11 heterozygotes). Direct genomic sequencing in heterozygous patients revealed the L90P (2 alleles), W24X (2 alleles), R184P (2 alleles), and 291insA (1 allele) mutations. Mutations in the GJB2 gene are responsible for about one third of prelingual, sensorineural, nonsyndromic deafness in the Greek population, and allele-specific PCR is an easy screening method for the common 35delG mutation.	4
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) autocrine enhance breast cancer cells survival. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Doxorubicin Female Fibroblast Growth Factors Gene Silencing Humans MCF-7 Cells Phosphorylation Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt RNA, Small Interfering Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 4 Signal Transduction || Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive tumor subtype with poor prognosis. The discovery of underlying mechanisms mediating tumor cell survival, and the development of novel agents to target these pathways, is a priority for patients with basal-like breast cancer. From a functional screen to identify key drivers of basal-like breast cancer cell growth, we identified fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) as a potential mediator of cell survival. We found that FGFR4 mediates cancer cell survival predominantly via activation of PI3K/AKT. Importantly, a subset of basal-like breast cancer cells also secrete fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), a canonical ligand specific for FGFR4. siRNA-mediated silencing of FGF19 or neutralization of extracellular FGF19 by anti-FGF19 antibody (1A6) decreases AKT phosphorylation, suppresses cancer cell growth and enhances doxorubicin sensitivity only in the FGFR4+/FGF19+ breast cancer cells. Consistently, FGFR4/FGF19 co-expression was also observed in 82 out of 287 (28.6%) primary breast tumors, and their expression is strongly associated with AKT phosphorylation, Ki-67 staining, higher tumor stage and basal-like phenotype. In summary, our results demonstrated the presence of an FGFR4/FGF19 autocrine signaling that mediates the survival of a subset of basal-like breast cancer cells and suggest that inactivation of this autocrine loop may potentially serve as a novel therapeutic intervention for future treatment of breast cancers.	0
Mental illness in mild PKU responds to biopterin. || Adult Biopterin Depression Female Humans Mental Disorders Mutation Panic Disorder Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || A 25-year-old woman with mild hyperphenylalaninemia developed disabling depression and panic attacks. The mutations on the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene indicated that she might be responsive to tetrahydrobiopterin therapy. Mutation analyses were performed by the John F. Kennedy Institute in Glostrup, Denmark. The response to tetrahydrobiopterin therapy was impressive at an oral dose of 50 mg twice a day. A 25-year-old woman with mild hyperphenylalaninemia due to a PAH mutation of IVS12nt1g-->a/E390G has been treated for 1 year with BH4 therapy. A maintenance dosage of only 100 mg/day has resulted in significant improvement of depression and panic attacks, with discontinuation of psychotropic medication.	1 3
Acquired resistance to AZD9291 as an upfront treatment is dependent on ERK signaling in a preclinical model. || Acrylamides Aniline Compounds Animals Antineoplastic Agents Body Weight Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mutation Neoplasm Transplantation Proteome Signal Transduction || AZD9291 (osimertinib) is approved for standard care in patients with EGFR T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior EGFR TKI progression. Furthermore, AZD9291 is now being evaluated as a first-line treatment for NSCLC patients with activation EGFR mutations. Based on previous experiments, resistance to AZD9291 as a first-line treatment may also emerge. Thus, identification and understanding of resistance mechanisms to AZD9291 as a first-line treatment can help direct development of future therapies. AZD9291-resistant cells (PC9/AZDR) were established using EGFR inhibitor-naïve PC9 cells. Resistance mechanisms were analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and a proteome profiler array. Resistance to AZD9291 developed through aberrant activation of ERK signaling by an EGFR-independent mechanism. The combination of a MEK inhibitor with AZD9291 restored the sensitivity of PC9/AZDR cells in vitro and in vivo. PC9/AZDR cells also showed increased MET expression and an HRAS G13R mutation. In addition, maspin expression was higher after AZD9291 treatment in PC9/AZDR cells. Sustained ERK activation confers resistance to AZD9291 as a first-line therapy. Thus, co-targeting EGFR and MEK may be an effective strategy to overcome resistance to AZD9291.	0
Nanoencapsulation of ABT-737 and camptothecin enhances their clinical potential through synergistic antitumor effects and reduction of systemic toxicity. || Animals Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Apoptosis Biphenyl Compounds Camptothecin Cell Line, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms Drug Compounding Drug Synergism Humans Male Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Nanoparticles Nitrophenols Piperazines Sulfonamides Thrombocytopenia || The simultaneous delivery of multiple cancer drugs in combination therapies to achieve optimal therapeutic effects in patients can be challenging. This study investigated whether co-encapsulation of the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) in PEGylated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) was a viable strategy for overcoming their clinical limitations and to deliver both compounds at optimal ratios. We found that thrombocytopenia induced by exposure to ABT-737 was diminished through its encapsulation in NPs. Similarly, CPT-associated leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity were reduced compared with the administration of free CPT. In addition to the reduction of dose-limiting side effects, the co-encapsulation of both anticancer compounds in a single NP produced synergistic induction of apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo colorectal cancer models. This strategy may widen the therapeutic window of these and other drugs and may enhance the clinical efficacy of synergistic drug combinations.	0
Novel mutation in MYH7 gene associated with distal myopathy and cardiomyopathy. || Adult Arginine Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathies Distal Myopathies Exons Female Humans Muscle, Skeletal Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Proline || A 25-year-old woman had childhood-onset muscle weakness and dilated cardiomyopathy. She exhibited predominantly distal weakness with early toe walking. Dilated cardiomyopathy required cardiac transplantation at age 15 years. We identified a de-novo, heterozygous, missense mutation, c.2348G>C (p. Arg783Pro), in exon 21 of the MYH7 gene, which encodes slow skeletal muscle fiber/β-cardiac myosin heavy chain protein, that replaces a highly conserved arginine with a proline. This novel mutation that results in the unusual combined cardiac and skeletal muscle phenotype localizes to the essential light chain binding area, a region only previously shown to be mutated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	4
The V388M mutation results in a kinetic variant form of phenylalanine hydroxylase. || Amino Acid Substitution Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Genetic Variation Humans Kinetics Mutation Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Recombinant Fusion Proteins || The molecular mechanism underlying the metabolic defect in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients carrying the V388M missense mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene has been characterized. An in vitro prokaryotic expression system has been used to produce both the wild-type and the mutant form of the human PAH (hPAH) protein. The recombinant enzymes, obtained as fusion proteins, were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and recovered in high yields. The wild-type hPAH possessed a high specific activity and its kinetic properties were the same as those reported for the enzyme isolated from human liver and other recombinant wild-type hPAH enzymes. The recombinant V388M mutant form exhibited a reduced specific activity equivalent to 30% of the wild-type hPAH enzyme when assayed using the synthetic cofactor (6-methyltetrahydropterin). Lower values were obtained (23 and 19%) when the mutant enzyme was assayed with the natural cofactor ((6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin) and different concentrations of l-phenylalanine. The enzyme kinetic studies of the V388M mutant protein revealed that this enzyme was a kinetic variant form of hPAH with a reduced affinity for l-phenylalanine and for the natural cofactor ((6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin). The residual activities determined for the V388M form of hPAH were compatible with the phenotype presented by the PKU patients harboring the V388M mutation in the PAH gene.	0
Immunohistochemical correlates of TP53 somatic mutations in cancer. || Age Factors DNA Mutational Analysis Databases, Factual Female Genes, p53 Genotype Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Mutation Neoplasms Observer Variation Phenotype Sex Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Despite controversy on the correlation between p53 accumulation and TP53 mutational status, immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of overexpressed protein has long been used as a surrogate method for mutation analysis. The aim of our study was to characterise the IHC expression features of TP53 somatic mutations and define their occurrence in human cancers. A large-scale database analysis was conducted in the IARC TP53 Database (R17); 7878 mutations with IHC features were retrieved representing 60 distinct tumour sites. The majority of the alterations were immunopositive (p <0.001). Sex was known for 4897 mutations showing a female dominance (57.2%) and females carrying negative mutations were significantly younger. TP53 mutations were divided into three IHC groups according to mutation frequency and IHC positivity. Each group had female dominance. Among the IHC groups, significant correlations were observed with age at diagnosis in breast, bladder, liver, haematopoietic system and head & neck cancers. An increased likelihood of false negative IHC associated with rare nonsense mutations was observed in certain tumour sites. Our study demonstrates that p53 immunopositivity largely correlates with TP53 mutational status but expression is absent in certain mutation types.Besides, describing the complex IHC expression of TP53 somatic mutations, our results reveal some caveats for the diagnostic practice.	4
TP53 mutation, mitochondria and cancer. || Humans Mitochondria Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Under normal conditions, basal levels of wild-type p53 promote mitochondrial function through multiple mechanisms. Remarkably, some missense mutations of p53, in contrast to the null state, can result in the retention of its metabolic activities. These effects are particularly prominent in the mitochondria and demonstrate a functional role for mutant p53 in cancer metabolism. This review summarizes accumulating data on the mechanisms by which p53 missense mutations can regulate mitochondrial metabolism and promote the viability and survival of both normal and cancer cells, thus acting as a double edged sword for the host. Greater understanding of these mechanisms may provide insights for developing new treatment or preventive strategies against cancer.	0
Protein kinase and protein phosphatase expression in the central nervous system of G93A mSOD over-expressing mice. || Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Animals Blotting, Western Brain Brain Chemistry Central Nervous System Disease Models, Animal Mice Mice, Transgenic Phosphoprotein Phosphatases Phosphoproteins Phosphorylation Protein Kinases Spinal Cord Superoxide Dismutase || The expressions of 78 protein kinases, 24 protein phosphatases and 31 phosphoproteins were investigated by Kinetworks trade mark analysis in brain and spinal cord tissue of transgenic mice over-expressing G93A mutant superoxide dismutase (mSOD), a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the brains of affected mSOD mice, we observed increased expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA, 111% increase compared with control), and protein phosphatase 2B Aalpha-catalytic subunit (calcineurin, 109% increase), and reductions in the levels of PAK3 (76% decrease) and protein phosphatase 2C Cbeta-subunit (32% decrease). Increased Ser259 phosphorylation of Raf1 (126% increase) in mSOD mice correlated with higher expression of p73 Raf1 (147% increase). There was also increased p73 Raf1 (69% increase) and Ser259 phosphorylation (45% increase) in the spinal cords of mSOD mice. While adducin underwent enhanced phosphorylation (alphaS724, 90% increase; gammaS662, 290% increase) in mSOD brain, its phosphorylation was lower in the mSOD spinal cord (alphaS724, 53% decrease; gammaS662, 46% decrease). In spinal cords of affected mSOD mice, we also observed elevated expression of casein kinase 1delta (CK1delta, 157% increase), JAK2 (84% increase), PKA (183% increase), protein kinase C (PKC) delta (123% increase), p124 PKC micro (142% increase), and RhoA kinase (221% increase), and enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinases 1 (ERK1, T202/Y204, 90% increase), and 2 (ERK2, T185/Y187, 73% increase), p38 MAP kinase (T180/Y182, 1570% increase), and PKBalpha (T308, 154% increase; S473, 61% increase). There was also reduced phosphorylation of RB (S780, 45% decrease; S807/S811, 65% decrease), Src (Y418, 63% decrease) and p40 SAPK/JNKbeta (T183/Y185, 43% decrease). Variability in the expression of kinases, phosphatases and phosphorylation of their substrates was observed even in mutant animals having a similar phenotype. The expression and phosphorylation differences between mSOD and control mice were dissimilar to those between ALS patients and controls. This finding indicates that the activation of protein kinases and phosphoproteins is different with neuron loss in the mSOD mouse compared with that seen in patients with the sporadic form of ALS.	0

SOS1 and PTPN11 mutations in five cases of Noonan syndrome with multiple giant cell lesions. || Adolescent Alleles Cherubism Child Giant Cells Humans Male Mutation Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Pigmentation Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 SOS1 Protein Signal Transduction Syndrome || We report five cases of multiple giant cell lesions in patients with typical Noonan syndrome. Such association has frequently been referred to as Noonan-like/multiple giant cell (NL/MGCL) syndrome before the molecular definition of Noonan syndrome. Two patients show mutations in PTPN11 (p.Tyr62Asp and p.Asn308Asp) and three in SOS1 (p.Arg552Ser and p.Arg552Thr). The latter are the first SOS1 mutations reported outside PTPN11 in NL/MGCL syndrome. MGCL lesions were observed in jaws ('cherubism') and joints ('pigmented villonodular synovitis'). We show through those patients that both types of MGCL are not PTPN11-specific, but rather represent a low penetrant (or perhaps overlooked) complication of the dysregulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. We recommend discarding NL/MGCL syndrome from the nosology, as this presentation is neither gene-nor allele-specific of Noonan syndrome; these patients should be described as Noonan syndrome with MGCL (of the mandible, the long bone...). The term cherubism should be used only when multiple giant cell lesions occur without any other clinical and molecular evidence of Noonan syndrome, with or without mutations of the SH3BP2 gene.	4
Newborn mass screening and molecular genetics of phenylketonuria in east Asia. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), and is performed with newborn mass screening. PKU causes irreversible mental retardation that can be prevented by a strict low-phenylalanine diet. More than 100 different mutations have been identified world wide and it has been revealed that PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder. Here, we describe the progress of the molecular genetics of PKU in East Asia. Approximately 60% of all PKU alleles in East Asians have been characterized with 10 PKU mutations. Two major PKU mutations, R413P and IVS4nt-1, may have originated in different populations, spreading in prehistoric times through the Asian continent due to the founder effect, genetic drift, and bottleneck effect. We found different mutations in Caucasians and East Asians, thus PKU mutations have occurred after ethnic divergence between Caucasians and East Asians. Furthermore, PKU genotype and in vitro PAH activity in expression analysis correlates to the clinical and biochemical phenotypes in East Asians. The molecular defects at the PAH gene regulate the in vivo PAH activities and clinical manifestations.	3
Molecular analysis of inherited cardiomyopathy using next generation semiconductor sequencing technologies. ||  || Cardiomyopathies are the most common clinical and genetic heterogeneity cardiac diseases, and genetic contribution in particular plays a major role in patients with primary cardiomyopathies. The aim of this study is to investigate cases of inherited cardiomyopathy (IC) for potential disease-causing mutations in 64 genes reported to be associated with IC. A total of 110 independent cases or families diagnosed with various primary cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, left ventricular non-compaction, and undefined cardiomyopathy, were collected after informed consent. A custom designed panel, including 64 genes, was screened using next generation sequencing on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. The best candidate disease-causing variants were verified by Sanger sequencing. A total of 78 variants in 73 patients were identified. After excluding the variants predicted to be benign and VUS, 26 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were verified in 26 probands (23.6%), including a homozygous variant in the SLC25A4 gene. Of these variants, 15 have been reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database or ClinVar database, while 11 are novel. The majority of variants were observed in the MYH7 (8/26) and MYBPC3 (6/26) gene. Titin (TTN) truncating mutations account for 13% in our dilated cardiomyopathy cases (3/23). This study provides an overview of the genetic aberrations in this cohort of Chinese IC patients and demonstrates the power of next generation sequencing in IC. Genetic results can provide precise clinical diagnosis and guidance regarding medical care for some individuals.	4
p53 mutation status is a primary determinant of placenta-specific protein 1 expression in serous ovarian cancers. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous Disease-Free Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Middle Aged Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Pregnancy Pregnancy Proteins Prognosis Promoter Regions, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Placenta-specific protein 1 (PLAC1) expression is co-opted in numerous human cancers. As a consequence of PLAC1 expression, tumor cells exhibit enhanced proliferation and invasiveness. This characteristic is associated with increased aggressiveness and worse patient outcomes. Recently, the presence of the tumor suppressor p53 was shown in vitro to inhibit PLAC1 transcription by compromising the P1, or distal/cancer, promoter. We sought to determine if this phenomenon occurs in primary patient tumors as well. Furthermore, we wanted to know if p53 mutation influenced PLAC1 expression as compared with wild-type. We chose to study serous ovarian tumors as they are well known to have a high rate of p53 mutation. We report herein that the phenomenon of PLAC1 transcription repression does occur in serous ovarian carcinomas but only when TP53 is wild-type. We find that mutant or absent p53 protein de-represses PLAC1 transcription. We further propose that the inability of mutant p53 to repress PLAC1 transcription is due to the fact that the altered TP53 protein is unable to occupy a putative p53 binding site in the PLAC1 P1 promoter thus allowing transcription to occur. Finally, we show that PLAC1 transcript number is significantly negatively correlated with patient survival in our samples. Thus, we suggest that characterizing tumors for TP53 mutation status, p53 protein status and PLAC1 transcription could be used to predict likely prognosis and inform treatment options in patients diagnosed with serous ovarian cancer.	0
lncRNA MIR100HG-derived miR-100 and miR-125b mediate cetuximab resistance via Wnt/β-catenin signaling. || Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological Cell Line, Tumor Cetuximab Disease Progression Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Epigenesis, Genetic GATA6 Transcription Factor Humans MicroRNAs RNA, Long Noncoding Signal Transduction Wnt Proteins beta Catenin || De novo and acquired resistance, which are largely attributed to genetic alterations, are barriers to effective anti-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor (EGFR) therapy. To generate cetuximab-resistant cells, we exposed cetuximab-sensitive colorectal cancer cells to cetuximab in three-dimensional culture. Using whole-exome sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we found that the long non-coding RNA MIR100HG and two embedded microRNAs, miR-100 and miR-125b, were overexpressed in the absence of known genetic events linked to cetuximab resistance. MIR100HG, miR-100 and miR-125b overexpression was also observed in cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell cancer cell lines and in tumors from colorectal cancer patients that progressed on cetuximab. miR-100 and miR-125b coordinately repressed five Wnt/β-catenin negative regulators, resulting in increased Wnt signaling, and Wnt inhibition in cetuximab-resistant cells restored cetuximab responsiveness. Our results describe a double-negative feedback loop between MIR100HG and the transcription factor GATA6, whereby GATA6 represses MIR100HG, but this repression is relieved by miR-125b targeting of GATA6. These findings identify a clinically actionable, epigenetic cause of cetuximab resistance.	0
Network modelling reveals the mechanism underlying colitis-associated colon cancer and identifies novel combinatorial anti-cancer targets. || Antineoplastic Agents Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Ceramides Colitis Colon Colonic Neoplasms Computer Simulation Epithelial Cells Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Regulatory Networks Humans Models, Genetic Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein Interaction Mapping Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The connection between inflammation and tumourigenesis has been well established. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying inflammation-associated tumourigenesis remains unknown because this process involves a complex interplay between immune microenvironments and epithelial cells. To obtain a more systematic understanding of inflammation-associated tumourigenesis as well as to identify novel therapeutic approaches, we constructed a knowledge-based network describing the development of colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) by integrating the extracellular microenvironment and intracellular signalling pathways. Dynamic simulations of the CAC network revealed a core network module, including P53, MDM2, and AKT, that may govern the malignant transformation of colon epithelial cells in a pro-tumor inflammatory microenvironment. Furthermore, in silico mutation studies and experimental validations led to a novel finding that concurrently targeting ceramide and PI3K/AKT pathway by chemical probes or marketed drugs achieves synergistic anti-cancer effects. Overall, our network model can guide further mechanistic studies on CAC and provide new insights into the design of combinatorial cancer therapies in a rational manner.	0
Quantification of topological features in cell meshes to explore E-cadherin dysfunction. || Animals CHO Cells Cadherins Cell Communication Cricetulus Cytological Techniques Humans Microscopy Mutant Proteins Neoplasms || In cancer, defective E-cadherin leads to cell detachment, migration and metastization. Further, alterations mediated by E-cadherin dysfunction affect cell topology and tissue organization. Herein, we propose a novel quantitative approach, based on microscopy images, to analyse abnormal cellular distribution patterns. We generated undirected graphs composed by sets of triangles which accurately reproduce cell positioning and structural organization within each image. Network analysis was developed by exploring triangle geometric features, namely area, edges length and formed angles, as well as their variance, when compared with the respective equilateral triangles. We generated synthetic networks, mimicking the diversity of cell-cell interaction patterns, and evaluated the applicability of the selected metrics to study topological features. Cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin and cancer-related mutants were used to validate our strategy. Specifically, A634V, R749W and P799R cancer-causing mutants present more disorganized spatial distribution when compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, P799R exhibited higher length and angle distortions and abnormal cytoskeletal organization, suggesting the formation of very dynamic and plastic cellular interactions. Hence, topological analysis of cell network diagrams is an effective tool to quantify changes in cell-cell interactions and, importantly, it can be applied to a myriad of processes, namely tissue morphogenesis and cancer.	0

Targeted/exome sequencing identified mutations in ten Chinese patients diagnosed with Noonan syndrome and related disorders. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool China Female Humans Infant LEOPARD Syndrome Male Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Retrospective Studies Whole Exome Sequencing || Noonan syndrome (NS) and Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) are autosomal dominant developmental disorders. NS and NSML are caused by abnormalities in genes that encode proteins related to the RAS-MAPK pathway, including PTPN11, RAF1, BRAF, and MAP2K. In this study, we diagnosed ten NS or NSML patients via targeted sequencing or whole exome sequencing (TS/WES). TS/WES was performed to identify mutations in ten Chinese patients who exhibited the following manifestations: potential facial dysmorphisms, short stature, congenital heart defects, and developmental delay. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the suspected pathological variants in the patients and their family members. TS/WES revealed three mutations in the PTPN11 gene, three mutations in RAF1 gene, and four mutations in BRAF gene in the NS and NSML patients who were previously diagnosed based on the abovementioned clinical features. All the identified mutations were determined to be de novo mutations. However, two patients who carried the same mutation in the RAF1 gene presented different clinical features. One patient with multiple lentigines was diagnosed with NSML, while the other patient without lentigines was diagnosed with NS. In addition, a patient who carried a hotspot mutation in the BRAF gene was diagnosed with NS instead of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFCS). TS/WES has emerged as a useful tool for definitive diagnosis and accurate genetic counseling of atypical cases. In this study, we analyzed ten Chinese patients diagnosed with NS and related disorders and identified their correspondingPTPN11, RAF1, and BRAF mutations. Among the target genes, BRAF showed the same degree of correlation with NS incidence as that of PTPN11 or RAF1.	4
A Wide and Specific Spectrum of Genetic Variants and Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Revealed by Next-Generation Sequencing in Patients with Left Ventricular Noncompaction. || Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Defibrillators, Implantable Disease-Free Survival Electric Countershock Female Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heart Transplantation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Infant Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular Myocardium Japan Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Mutation Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Predictive Value of Tests Time Factors Ventricular Function, Left || Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) has since been classified as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy, but the genetic basis is not fully evaluated. The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic spectrum using next-generation sequencing and to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations in LVNC patients. Using next-generation sequencing, we targeted and sequenced 73 genes related to cardiomyopathy in 102 unrelated LVNC patients. We identified 43 pathogenic variants in 16 genes in 39 patients (38%); 28 were novel variants. Sarcomere gene variants accounted for 63%, and variants in genes associated with channelopathies accounted for 12%. MYH7 andTAZ pathogenic variants were the most common, and rare variant collapsing analysis showed variants in these genes contributed to the risk of LVNC, although patients carryingMYH7 andTAZ pathogenic variants displayed different phenotypes. Patients with pathogenic variants had early age of onset and more severely decreased left ventricular ejection fractions. Survival analysis showed poorer prognosis in patients with pathogenic variants, especially those with multiple variants: All died before their first birthdays. Adverse events were noted in 17 patients, including 13 deaths, 3 heart transplants, and 1 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion. Congestive heart failure at diagnosis and pathogenic variants were independent risk factors for these adverse events. Next-generation sequencing revealed a wide spectrum of genetic variations and a high incidence of pathogenic variants in LVNC patients. These pathogenic variants were independent risk factors for adverse events. Patients harboring pathogenic variants showed poor prognosis and should be followed closely.	4
Deafness gene mutations in newborns in Beijing. || China Cities Deafness Female Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Neonatal Screening || To determine the incidence of congenital hearing loss (HL) in newborns by the rate of deafness-related genetic mutations. Clinical study of consecutive newborns in Beijing using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction-based universal array. This study tested 37 573 newborns within 3 days after birth, including nine sites in four genes: GJB2 (35 del G, 176 del 16, 235 del C, 299 del AT), SLC26A4 (IVS7-2 A > G, 2168 A > G), MTRNR1 (1555 A > G, 1494 C > T), and GJB3 (538 C > T). The birth condition of infants was also recorded. Of 37 573 newborns, 1810 carried pathogenic mutations, or 4.817%. The carrier rates of GJB2 (35 del G, 176 del 16, 235 del C, 299 del AT), GJB3 (538 C > T), SLC26A4 (IVS7-2 A > G, 2168 A > G), and MTRNR1 (1555 A > G, 1494 C > T) mutations were 0.005%, 0.104%, 1.924%, 0.551%, 0.295%, 0.253%, 1.387%, 0.024%, and 0.274%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated no statistically significant relationship between mutations and infant sex, premature delivery, twin status, or birth weight. The 235delC GJB2 mutation was the most frequent deafness-related mutation in the Chinese population. Genetic screening for the deafness gene will help detect more cases of newborn congenital HL than current screening practices.	4

In this study, we investigated the genetic etiology of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in a Turkish cohort including individuals with cochlear implant, who had a pedigree suggestive of an autosomal recessive inheritance. A workflow including prescreening of GJB2 and a targeted next generation sequencing panel (Illumına TruSightTM Exome) covering 2761 genes that we briefly called as mendelian exome sequencing was used. This panel includes 102 deafness genes and a number of genes causing Mendelian disorders. Using this approach, we identified causative variants in 21 of 29 families. Three different GJB2 variants were present in seven families. Remaining 14 families had 15 different variants in other known NSHL genes (MYO7A, MYO15A, MARVELD2, TMIE, DFNB31, LOXHD1, GPSM2, TMC1, USH1G, CDH23). Of these variants, eight are novel. Mutation detection rate of our workflow is 72.4%, confirming the usefulness of targeted sequencing approach in NSHL.	4
M34T and V37I mutations in GJB2 associated hearing impairment: evidence for pathogenicity and reduced penetrance. || Adult Age of Onset Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Disease Progression Female Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Penetrance Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || Despite research the role of the M34T and V37I variants of GJB2 in causing hearing impairment (HI) remains controversial. Our purpose was to test a hypothesis that M34T and V37I are pathogenic but have distinct features resulting in a reduced penetrance. We screened for known GJB2/GJB6 mutations 233 Polish consecutive unrelated subjects with non-syndromic, sensorineural HI who were previously found to carry 35delG mutation on one chromosome. The most frequent mutations were also analyzed in approximately 1,000 controls. We found that M34T and V37I were significantly (P < 10(-6)) overrepresented among patients, but their penetrance was estimated as 1/10 relative to mutations of undisputed pathogenicity. This finding apparently could not be explained by low degree of HI associated with M34T and V37I since another mutation causing comparably mild HI (L90P) did not have reduced penetrance. Subsequent analyses showed that the patients with M34T/35delG and V37I/35delG had significantly later onset of HI than patients with other genotypes (P < 10(-6)) including the L90P/35delG (P = 0.006). Also, among these patients (but not others) a strong correlation between the degree of HI and its duration was found (r = 0.79, P < 10(-5)). We tentatively suggest that M34T and V37I might cause mild HI characterized by relatively late onset and progression.	4
Dysregulation of microRNA biogenesis in cancer: the impact of mutant p53 on Drosha complex activity. || Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Regulatory Networks Humans MicroRNAs Mutation Neoplasms Ribonuclease III Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || A widespread decrease of mature microRNAs is often observed in human malignancies giving them potential to act as tumor suppressors. Thus, microRNAs may be potential targets for cancer therapy. The global miRNA deregulation is often the result of defects in the miRNA biogenesis pathway, such as genomic mutation or aberrant expression/localization of enzymes and cofactors responsible of miRNA maturation. Alterations in the miRNA biogenesis machinery impact on the establishment and development of cancer programs. Accumulation of pri-microRNAs and corresponding depletion of mature microRNAs occurs in human cancers compared to normal tissues, strongly indicating an impairment of crucial steps in microRNA biogenesis. In agreement, inhibition of microRNA biogenesis, by depletion of Dicer1 and Drosha, tends to enhance tumorigenesis in vivo. The p53 tumor suppressor gene, TP53, is mutated in half of human tumors resulting in an oncogene with Gain-Of-Function activities. In this review we discuss recent studies that have underlined a role of mutant p53 (mutp53) on the global regulation of miRNA biogenesis in cancer. In particular we describe how a new transcriptionally independent function of mutant p53 in miRNA maturation, through a mechanism by which this oncogene is able to interfere with the Drosha processing machinery, generally inhibits miRNA processing in cancer and consequently impacts on carcinogenesis.	0
ABI3, a component of the WAVE2 complex, is potentially regulated by PI3K/AKT pathway. ||  || We previously reported that ABI3 expression is lost in follicular thyroid carcinomas and its restoration significantly inhibited cell growth, invasiveness, migration, and reduced tumor growthin vivo. The mechanistic basis by which ABI3 exerts its tumor suppressive effects is not fully understood. In this study, we show that ABI3 is a phosphoprotein. Using proteomic array analysis, we showed that ABI3 modulated distinct cancer-related pathways in thyroid cancer cells. The KEA analysis found that PI3K substrates were enriched and forced expression of ABI3 markedly decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and the downstream-targeted protein pGSK3β. We next used immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry to identify ABI3-interacting proteins that may be involved in modulating/integrating signaling pathways. We identified 37 ABI3 partners, including several components of the canonical WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) such as WAVE2/CYF1P1/NAP1, suggesting that ABI3 function might be regulated through WRC. Both, pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and mutation at residue S342 of ABI3, which is predicted to be phosphorylated by AKT, provided evidences that the non-phosphorylated form of ABI3 is preferentially present in the WRC protein complex. Collectively, our findings suggest that ABI3 might be a downstream mediator of the PI3K/AKT pathway that might disrupt WRC via ABI3 phosphorylation.	0
Phenylketonuria in Spain: RFLP haplotypes and linked mutations. || DNA Mutational Analysis France Gene Frequency Genetic Linkage Genetic Variation Genotype Haplotypes Humans Mediterranean Sea Molecular Epidemiology Mutation Phenotype Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Portugal Spain || In order to investigate the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in Spain, we analyzed the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes and common mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in 32 unrelated Spanish PKU families. The distribution of RFLP haplotypes differs from that of northern Europe. Mutant haplotypes 2 and 3 were completely absent in our sample. Approximately 65% of the mutant alleles are confined to three RFLP haplotypes, namely haplotypes 1, 6 and 9, also frequently found in other Mediterranean populations. We screened for previously described PKU mutations using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotides, and found IVS10, I65T, E280K and P281L as the major mutations, representing 41% of the PKU alleles. Other mutations found were Y414C, and a new one, P244L. Mutations R408W and IVS12, prevalent in northern Europe, as well as others present in southern European populations (R252W, R261Q, L249F) were not detected in our sample. Our results reveal the genetic heterogeneity present in the Spanish PKU population, which shows similarities to others of Mediterranean origin.	3
Molecular genetics applied to clinical practice: the Cx26 hearing impairment. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Audiology Audiometry, Pure-Tone Child Child, Preschool Chromosome Aberrations Chromosome Disorders Connexins Gene Expression Health Services Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Molecular Biology Point Mutation Retrospective Studies Severity of Illness Index || Mutations in the Cx26/GJB2 gene account for a large proportion of pre-lingual hearing impairment with a prevalence up to 50% in autosomal recessive cases and a still undefined prevalence in sporadic cases. Ninety-four subjects affected by non-syndromal sensorineural hearing impairment (NSHI) were enrolled in the study. The patients had either a family history of childhood hearing deficit or represented sporadic cases. The risk of an acquired cause of the deficit has been carefully excluded. Audiological characteristics were investigated. Cx26 mutations were found in 50% of subjects. Seventy-three per cent of mutations in this gene were 35delG, with significant geographical variations. In 7% of the putative Cx26 alleles no mutations were detected either in the coding region or in the non-coding exon 1. Cx26 hearing impairment involves all frequencies, is of variable severity, and is very rarely progressive and most frequently symmetrical between the two ears. The high occurrence of this type of pre-lingual hearing impairment argues for modification of the protocols used to investigate the aetiology of childhood hearing impairment. Early screening for Cx26 mutations in all patients with non-syndromal familial and sporadic permanent childhood hearing impairment seems justified.	4
Next-generation genetic testing for retinitis pigmentosa. || Alleles Computational Biology Female Genetic Variation Genotype High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Quality Control Reproducibility of Results Retinitis Pigmentosa || Molecular diagnostics for patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) has been hampered by extreme genetic and clinical heterogeneity, with 52 causative genes known to date. Here, we developed a comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach for the clinical molecular diagnostics of RP. All known inherited retinal disease genes (n = 111) were captured and simultaneously analyzed using NGS in 100 RP patients without a molecular diagnosis. A systematic data analysis pipeline was developed and validated to prioritize and predict the pathogenicity of all genetic variants identified in each patient, which enabled us to reduce the number of potential pathogenic variants from approximately 1,200 to zero to nine per patient. Subsequent segregation analysis and in silico predictions of pathogenicity resulted in a molecular diagnosis in 36 RP patients, comprising 27 recessive, six dominant, and three X-linked cases. Intriguingly, De novo mutations were present in at least three out of 28 isolated cases with causative mutations. This study demonstrates the enormous potential and clinical utility of NGS in molecular diagnosis of genetically heterogeneous diseases such as RP. De novo dominant mutations appear to play a significant role in patients with isolated RP, having major implications for genetic counselling.	4

As the role of the RAS/MAPK pathway in HCM pathogenesis is unclear, we generated a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model for CFCS from three patients with activating BRAF mutations. By cell sorting for SIRPα and CD90, we generated a method to examine hiPSC-derived cell type-specific phenotypes and cellular interactions underpinning HCM. BRAF-mutant SIRPα(+)/CD90(-) cardiomyocytes displayed cellular hypertrophy, pro-hypertrophic gene expression, and intrinsic calcium-handling defects. BRAF-mutant SIRPα(-)/CD90(+) cells, which were fibroblast-like, exhibited a pro-fibrotic phenotype and partially modulated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) paracrine signaling. Inhibition of TGFβ or RAS/MAPK signaling rescued the hypertrophic phenotype. Thus, cell autonomous and non-autonomous defects underlie HCM due to BRAF mutations. TGFβ inhibition may be a useful therapeutic option for patients with HCM due to RASopathies or other etiologies.	0
Modulation of wild-type p53 activity by mutant p53 R273H depends on the p53 responsive element (p53RE).

The transcriptional function of p53 is mediated by specific responsive elements (REs). The MDM2, WAF1/Cip1 and Bax genes possess p53REs and their activation by wt p53 induces cell cycle progression, arrest and programmed cell death (apoptosis), respectively. Mutations of the p53 gene are detected in more than 50% of the human malignant tumors. p53 mutants seem to have a more stable conformation and are suggested to exert dominant-negative inhibition of wt p53 in cells containing both wt and mutant (mt) alleles. However, recent studies show that certain mt p53 proteins posses a "gain of function" phenotype. In the present study, we examined the effects of the second most frequent p53 mutant R273H on the p53REs of the MDM2, WAF1/Cip1 and Bax genes in the H1299 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line. Although mt p53 R273H alone was unable to bind and transactivate the corresponding p53REs, it enhanced the MDM2-p53RE mediated gene transcription of wt p53 (positive-dominant effect) and prevented the wt p53 transactivation of the p53REs of WAF1/Cip1 and Bax genes (negative-dominant effect). Our data suggest that in the appropriate environment, differential transcription of critical p53 target genes by certain p53 mutant proteins may illustrate another mechanism implicated in tumor development.	0

It is associated with Cowden syndrome and naevus sebaceus (NS), but the pathogenesis of sporadic tumours is poorly understood. Recently, NS was found to be caused by postzygotic HRAS or KRAS mutations. We sought to determine whether NS-related and NS-unrelated trichilemmomas harbour RAS mutations. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks of 12 NS-related and 15 NS-unrelated trichilemmomas from 26 individuals were retrieved and analysed to determine the presence of mutations in exons 1 and 2 of the HRAS, KRAS and NRAS genes by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Mutational hotspots of the FGFR3 and PIK3CA genes were also analysed for NS-unrelated cases. Among the 27 cases, mutually exclusive HRAS c.37G>C and c.182A>G mutations were observed in 17 and three tumours, respectively. Of the 12 NS-related tumours, 11 (92%) harboured the HRAS c.37G>C substitution. Of the 15 sporadic tumours, nine (60%) harboured HRAS mutations, including six c.37G>C and three c.182A>G. An HRAS c.182A>G mutation was observed only in sporadic tumours. No mutations were observed in the other genes that were tested. The high frequency of HRAS activating mutations, including the c.182A>G substitution, which was rather rare in NS, suggests that most trichilemmomas are authentic neoplasms.	4
The anti-apoptotic activity of BAG3 is restricted by caspases and the proteasome. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Caspases Cell Line, Tumor Gene Silencing Humans Hydrolysis Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Ubiquitination || Caspase-mediated cleavage and proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins are two independent mechanisms for the regulation of protein stability and cellular function. We previously reported BAG3 overexpression protected ubiquitinated clients, such as AKT, from proteasomal degradation and conferred cytoprotection against heat shock. We hypothesized that the BAG3 protein is regulated by proteolysis. Staurosporine (STS) was used as a tool to test for caspase involvement in BAG3 degradation. MDA435 and HeLa human cancer cell lines exposed to STS underwent apoptosis with a concomitant time and dose-dependent loss of BAG3, suggesting the survival role of BAG3 was subject to STS regulation. zVAD-fmk or caspase 3 and 9 inhibitors provided a strong but incomplete protection of both cells and BAG3 protein. Two putative caspase cleavage sites were tested: KEVD (BAG3(E345A/D347A)) within the proline-rich center of BAG3 (PXXP) and the C-terminal LEAD site (BAG3(E516A/D518A)). PXXP deletion mutant and BAG3(E345A/D347A), or BAG3(E516A/D518A) respectively slowed or stalled STS-mediated BAG3 loss. BAG3, ubiquitinated under basal growth conditions, underwent augmented ubiquitination upon STS treatment, while there was no increase in ubiquitination of the BAG3(E516A/D518A) caspase-resistant mutant. Caspase and proteasome inhibition resulted in partial and independent protection of BAG3 whereas inhibitors of both blocked BAG3 degradation. STS-induced apoptosis was increased when BAG3 was silenced, and retention of BAG3 was associated with cytoprotection. BAG3 is tightly controlled by selective degradation during STS exposure. Loss of BAG3 under STS injury required sequential caspase cleavage followed by polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The need for dual regulation of BAG3 in apoptosis suggests a key role for BAG3 in cancer cell resistance to apoptosis.	0
The oncocytic subtype is genetically distinct from other pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm subtypes. || Biomarkers, Tumor Chromogranins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA-Binding Proteins Female GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms, Cystic, Mucinous, and Serous Oncogene Proteins Oxyphil Cells Pancreatic Neoplasms Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Whole Genome Sequencing || In 2010, the World Health Organization reclassified the entity originally described as intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm as the 'oncocytic subtype' of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Although several key molecular alterations of other intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm subtypes have been discovered, including common mutations in KRAS, GNAS, and RNF3, those of oncocytic subtype have not been well characterized. We analyzed 11 pancreatic 'oncocytic subtype' of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Nine pancreatic 'oncocytic subtype' of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms uniformly exhibited typical entity-defining morphology of arborizing papillae lined by layers of cells with oncocytic cytoplasm, prominent, nucleoli, and intraepithelial lumina. The remaining two were atypical. One lacked the arborizing papilla and had flat oncocytic epithelium only; the other one had focal oncocytic epithelium in a background of predominantly intestinal subtype intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Different components of this case were analyzed separately. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of all cases were microdissected and subjected to high-depth-targeted next-generation sequencing for a panel of 300 key cancer-associated genes in a platform that enabled the identification of sequence mutations, copy number alterations, and select structural rearrangements involving all targeted genes. Fresh frozen specimens of two cases were also subjected to whole-genome sequencing. For the nine typical pancreatic 'oncocytic subtype' of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, the number of mutations per case, identified by next-generation sequencing, ranged from 1 to 10 (median=4). None of these cases had KRAS or GNAS mutations and only one had both RNF43 and PIK3R1 mutations. ARHGAP26, ASXL1, EPHA8, and ERBB4 genes were somatically altered in more than one of these typical 'oncocytic subtype' of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms but not in the other two atypical ones. In the neoplasm with flat oncocytic epithelium, the only mutated gene was KRAS. All components of the intestinal subtype intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with focal oncocytic epithelium manifested TP53, GNAS, and RNF43 mutations. In conclusion, this study elucidates that 'oncocytic subtype' of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is not only morphologically distinct but also genetically distinct from other intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm subtypes. Considering that now its biologic behavior is also being found to be different than other intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm subtypes, 'oncocytic subtype' of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm warrants being recognized separately.	4
A century of cholesterol and coronaries: from plaques to genes to statins. || Animals Cardiovascular Diseases Cholesterol Coronary Vessels Dietary Fats Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Plaque, Atherosclerotic Receptors, LDL || One-fourth of all deaths in industrialized countries result from coronary heart disease. A century of research has revealed the essential causative agent: cholesterol-carrying low-density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL is controlled by specific receptors (LDLRs) in liver that remove it from blood. Mutations that eliminate LDLRs raise LDL and cause heart attacks in childhood, whereas mutations that raise LDLRs reduce LDL and diminish heart attacks. If we are to eliminate coronary disease, lowering LDL should be the primary goal. Effective means to achieve this goal are currently available. The key questions are: who to treat, when to treat, and how long to treat.	4
Reoperation for intracranial hypertension in TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome: a 15-year review. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses Female Gene Deletion Humans Infant Intracranial Hypertension Male Nuclear Proteins Point Mutation Recurrence Reoperation Retrospective Studies Twist-Related Protein 1 || Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a syndromic craniosynostosis defined by a genetic mutation affecting the TWIST1 gene on chromosome 7p21. It is typically associated with unicoronal or bicoronal synostosis, eyelid ptosis, dysmorphic external ears, and other variable facial and limb abnormalities. Surgical management of the craniosynostosis addresses the calvarial deformity and may relieve or reduce the risk of intracranial hypertension. The aim of this study was to assess surgical intervention, with particular consideration of the reoperation rate for intracranial hypertension, in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome patients. A retrospective case note analysis was performed on all patients with a confirmed TWIST1 gene abnormality who attended the Oxford Craniofacial Unit over a 15-year period. Each patient's mutation and clinical features were recorded. Surgical intervention and sequelae were examined in greater detail. Thirty-four patients with genetically confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome were identified. All had craniosynostosis (bicoronal, 76 percent; unicoronal, 18 percent; bicoronal and sagittal, 6 percent), and the majority had eyelid ptosis, low frontal hairline, and external ear anomalies. Thirty-one patients had received surgical intervention. Nine of 26 patients (35 percent) with at least 12 months of follow-up after primary intervention and eight of 19 patients (42 percent) with at least 5 years of follow-up developed intracranial hypertension necessitating secondary calvarial surgery. Despite standard surgical intervention, patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a high rate (35 to 42 percent) of recurrent intracranial hypertension necessitating further surgical expansion. All patients with either bicoronal synostosis or unicoronal synostosis with syndromic features should be screened for TWIST1 mutations, as this confers a greater risk than nonsyndromic synostosis of the same sutures. Regular follow-up throughout the childhood years is essential.	4
Phenotypic characteristics of the p.Asn215Ser (p.N215S) GLA mutation in male and female patients with Fabry disease: A multicenter Fabry Registry study. ||  || The p.Asn215Ser or p.N215S GLA variant has been associated with late-onset cardiac variant of Fabry disease. To expand on the scarce phenotype data, we analyzed natural history data from 125 p.N215S patients (66 females, 59 males) enrolled in the Fabry Registry (NCT00196742) and compared it with data from 401 patients (237 females, 164 males) harboring mutations associated with classic Fabry disease. We evaluated interventricular septum thickness (IVST), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), estimated glomerular filtration rate and severe clinical events. In p.N215S males, mildly abnormal mean IVST and LVPWT values were observed in patients aged 25-34 years, and values gradually increased with advancing age. Mean values were similar to those of classic males. In p.N215S females, these abnormalities occurred primarily in patients aged 55-64 years. Severe clinical events in p.N215S patients were mainly cardiac (males 31%, females 8%) while renal and cerebrovascular events were rare. Renal impairment occurred in 17% of p.N215S males (mostly in patients aged 65-74 years), and rarely in females (3%). p.N215S is a disease-causing mutation with severe clinical manifestations found primarily in the heart. Cardiac involvement may become as severe as in classic Fabry patients, especially in males.	4
The A1555G mitochondrial DNA mutation in Greek patients with non-syndromic, sensorineural hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Child Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Greece Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Young Adult || Mitochondrial DNA mutations are undoubtedly a factor that contributes to sensorineural, non-syndromic deafness. One specific mutation, the A1555G, is associated with both aminoglycoside-induced and non-syndromic hearing impairment. The mutation is considered to be the most common of all mitochondrial DNA deafness-causing mutations but its frequency varies between different populations. Here we report on the first large screening of the A1555G mitochondrial DNA mutation in the Greek population. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the A1555G mutation in Greek sensorineural, non-syndromic deafness patients, with childhood onset. We screened 478 unrelated Greek patients with hearing loss of any degree and found two individuals harboring the A1555G mutation (0.42%). Both cases had been subjected to aminoglycosides. They were prelingual, familial and homoplasmic for the A1555G mutation. One of the cases was also found heterozygous for the frequent GJB2 35delG mutation, while the other case was negative. The A1555G mutation seems to be less common than in other European populations.	4
BRAF and NRAS mutations are heterogeneous and not mutually exclusive in nodular melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Amino Acid Substitution Female Follow-Up Studies GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf || Inhibitors of RAF inhibit the MAPK pathway that plays an important role in the development and progression of those melanoma carrying the V600E BRAF mutation, but there's a subset of such patients who do not respond to the therapy. Various mechanisms of drug resistance have been proposed which include the clonal heterogeneity of the tumor. We have studied a population of nodular melanoma to investigate the intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity by Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) analysis. Our results showed that BRAF and NRAS mutations were detected in 47% and 33% of nodular melanoma, respectively, and that there is a discrepancy in mutational pattern of tumoral sample because in the 36% of patients a different mutation, in at least 1 area of the tumor, was found by LCM analysis, giving evidence of the presence of different clonal cells populations. Moreover, we found that mutations in BRAF and NRAS are not mutually exclusive because they were simultaneously present in the same tumor specimens and we observed that when the 2 different mutations were present one is a high-frequency mutation and the other is a low-frequency mutation. This was more evident in lymphonodal metastasis that resulted from wild type to mutational analysis, but showed different mutations following LCM analysis. Therefore, we believed that, when primary tumoral sample results negative to mutational analysis, if it is possible, metastases should be investigated to verify the presence of mutations. Generally, it should be searched for other mutations, in addition to BRAF V600E, so as to better understand the mechanism of drug resistance.	4
Phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations and phenylalanine-tyrosine metabolism in heterozygotes for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. ||  || The aim of this study was to determine whether any relationship exists between the severity of mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and the plasma concentrations of phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) under fasting and semifasting conditions among heterozygotes in a matched case-control study. Parents of patients affected by PAH deficiency (n = 25) detected through the Italian Neonatal Screening Program and referred from January 1994 to June 2000, and parents of healthy children were investigated. In total, 68 subjects without any disease, 34 hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) heterozygous parents and 34 age- and gender-matched controls, were recruited. Plasma concentrations of Phe and Tyr in fasting and semifasting (1600 mg Phe oral load) conditions were the main outcome measures. DNA analysis for PAH mutations was performed in all 68 subjects. Compared with controls, heterozygotes showed higher fasting and semifasting Phe concentrations (p < 0.0001), lower semifasting Tyr concentrations (p = 0.015), lower Tyr variations (p = 0.003) and a higher Phe/Tyr ratio (p < 0.0001) in switching from fasting to semifasting conditions. Heterozygotes carrying a severe mutation showed semifasting plasma Tyr concentrations lower than controls (p = 0.019) but not significantly different from Tyr levels found in non-severe carriers (p = 0.197). The Tyr variations were minor in severe carriers than controls (p < 0.001) and non-severe carriers too, although with lower significance (p = 0.089). In six carriers of A403V mutation, parents of mild hyperphenylalaninaemics on an unrestricted diet, significant differences in variations from fasting to semifasting conditions were found compared with parents of patients on a diet. Although the great heterogeneity of PAH mutations limits any general conclusion, the results suggest that monitoring plasma Tyr variations may be more sensitive than plasma Phe in assessing the severity of PAH mutations in HPA heterozygotes.	3
Iodine induces apoptosis via regulating MAPKs-related p53, p21, and Bcl-xL in thyroid cancer cells. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cytoprotection Enzyme Activation Humans Iodine MAP Kinase Signaling System Mitochondria Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutation Signal Transduction Thyroid Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation bcl-X Protein || Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and exhibits the full range of malignant behaviors from the relatively indolent occult differentiated thyroid cancer to uniformly aggressive and lethal anaplastic thyroid cancer. Iodine is a well known key element in thyroid normal function maintenance and thyroid cancer development. However, the effects induced by iodine and the molecular mechanisms involved remain poorly understood in thyroid cancer. We investigated the apoptotic effect of iodine on three different subtypes of thyroid cancer cells. We observed that apoptosis induced by iodine was mitochondrial-mediated. Iodine treatment decreased the level of mutant p53 including the R273H mutant that possesses anti-apoptotic features, but increased the p21 level. Surprisingly, high doses of iodine promoted instead of suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL expression. Moreover, iodine transiently activated the subfamily members of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (ERK1/2, p38 and JNK1/2) which contribute to modulate p53, p21 and Bcl-xL expression. The further results showed the three subfamily members of MAPKs all worked as anti-apoptotic factors. Collectively, iodine-induced apoptotic pathway is involved in the activation of MAPKs-related p21, Bcl-xL and mutant p53 regulation. The findings provide solid molecular evidence to explain the potential pathway for iodine to influence thyroid cancer development. It may also reveal some novel molecular targets for the treatment of thyroid cancer.	0
Defect in MAPK signaling as a cause for monogenic obesity caused by inactivating mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene. || HEK293 Cells Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Immunoblotting Luminescent Measurements MAP Kinase Signaling System Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Models, Molecular Mutation Obesity Phosphorylation Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 || The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a Family A G protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in regulating energy homeostasis, including both energy intake and expenditure. Mutations leading to a reduced MC4R function confer a major gene effect for obesity. More than 170 distinct mutations have been identified in humans. In addition to the conventional Gs-stimulated cAMP pathway, the MC4R also activates MAPKs, especially ERK1/2. We also showed there is biased signaling in the two signaling pathways, with inverse agonists in the Gs-cAMP pathway acting as agonists for the ERK1/2 pathway. In the current study, we sought to determine whether defects in basal or agonist-induced ERK1/2 activation in MC4R mutants might potentially contribute to obesity pathogenesis in patients carrying these mutations. The constitutive and ligand-stimulated ERK1/2 activation were measured in wild type and 73 naturally occurring MC4R mutations. We showed that nineteen mutants had significantly decreased basal pERK1/2 level, and five Class V variants (where no functional defects have been identified previously), C40R, V50M, T112M, A154D and S295P, had impaired ligand-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Our studies demonstrated for the first time that decreased basal or ligand-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling might contribute to obesity pathogenesis caused by mutations in the MC4R gene. We also observed biased signaling in 25 naturally occurring mutations in the Gs-cAMP and ERK1/2 pathways.	0
Relation of PCSK9 mutations to serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in childhood and adulthood (from The Bogalusa Heart Study). || African Americans Alleles Cholesterol, LDL Codon, Nonsense Coronary Disease European Continental Ancestry Group Female Humans Louisiana Male Mutation, Missense Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Risk Factors Serine Endopeptidases || Specific mutations in the gene for proprotein convertase, subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), that are associated with lower coronary heart disease risk may produce lifelong decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but data on their effects in younger subjects are lacking. We analyzed associations of 1 missense (R46L) and 2 nonsense (Y142X and C679X) PCSK9 mutations with serum LDL cholesterol in 478 African-Americans and 1,086 whites, 4 to 38 years of age, examined 3 to 8 times in the Bogalusa Heart Study. L46 allele frequency in whites was 0.017 +/- 0.003; the combined frequency of X142 or X679 alleles in African-Americans was 0.016 +/- 0.005. In whites, LDL cholesterol was lower in L46 carriers (78.9 +/- 21.8 mg/dl) than in noncarriers (89.7 +/- 24.9 mg/dl, p = 0.027) at their first examination (mean age 9.4 +/- 3.2 years). African-Americans carrying the X142 or X679 allele had lower LDL cholesterol levels than did noncarriers (77.3 +/- 15.1 vs 91.4 +/- 23.9 mg/dl, p = 0.043) at their first examination (mean age 9.0 +/- 3.0 years). Longitudinal LDL cholesterol profiles were significantly lower in whites with the L46 allele and in African-Americans with the X142 or X679 allele. In conclusion, our results show that these PCSK9 variants are associated with significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels starting in childhood.	4
Targeted sequencing may facilitate differential diagnostics of pulmonary tumours: a case series. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Adenomyoepithelioma Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Biopsy Breast Neoplasms Colorectal Neoplasms Diagnosis, Differential Female Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Sequence Analysis, DNA Transcriptome || Histopathological diagnosis is important for prognostication and choice of treatment in patients with cancer in the lung. Metastases to the lungs are common and need to be distinguished from primary lung cancer. Furthermore, cases with synchronous or metachronous primary lung cancers (although infrequent) are often handled differently than cases with lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis or relapse, respectively. In some cases, morphology and immunohistochemical staining is not sufficient for certain diagnosis. The present study included six cases where molecular genetic analysis in form of pyrosequencing or targeted next-generation sequencing was of value for certain diagnosis of selected tumours in the lung. Two of the included cases were rare metastases to the lung; colorectal cancer with IHC profile consistent with primary lung cancer and malignant adenomyoepithelioma of the breast, respectively, where molecular genetic analysis was of aid for proving the relationship to the primary tumour. The other four cases were multiple lung adenocarcinomas where molecular genetic analysis was of aid to distinguish between intrapulmonary metastasis and synchronous tumour. Comparison of molecular genetic profile may be an important tool for determination of relationship between tumours in some situations and should always be considered in unclear cases. Further studies on concordance and discordance of molecular genetic profiles between spatially or temporally different tumours with common origin may be helpful for improved diagnostics of pulmonary tumours.	4
Homoplasmy of the G7444A mtDNA and heterozygosity of the GJB2 c.35delG mutations in a family with hearing loss. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Follow-Up Studies Genes, Mitochondrial Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Predisposition to Disease Greece Hearing Loss Humans Male Pedigree Point Mutation RNA, Transfer Risk Assessment || Mitochondrial mutations have been shown to be responsible for syndromic as well as non-syndromic hearing loss. The G7444A mitochondrial DNA mutation affects COI/the precursor of tRNA(Ser(UCN)), encoding the first subunit of cytochrome oxidase. Here we report on the first Greek family with the G7444A mitochondrial DNA mutation. Clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular methods were employed in this study. We describe the high variability of phenotypes among three family members harboring the G7444A mutation and also the frequent GJB2 c.35delG mutation of the nuclear genome in heterozygosity. Their phenotypes ranged from normal hearing to deafness, while the proband presented with several other symptoms. The G7444A mitochondrial DNA mutation has been reported in only a few cases worldwide, alone or in cosegregation with other mitochondrial DNA mutations, but to our knowledge, never before in coexistence with the GJB2 c.35delG mutation.	4
BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) mutation analysis in metastatic melanoma using immunohistochemistry: a study of 754 cases highlighting potential pitfalls and guidelines for interpretation and reporting. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Sensitivity and Specificity Skin Neoplasms Tissue Array Analysis || BRAF or NRAS mutations occur in approximately 60% of cutaneous melanomas, and the identification of such mutations underpins the appropriate selection of patients who may benefit from BRAF and MEK inhibitor targeted therapies. The utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect NRAS(Q61L) mutations is currently unknown. This study sought to assess the sensitivity and specificity of anti-BRAF(V600E) (VE1), anti-NRAS(Q61R) (SP174) and anti-NRAS(Q61L) (26193) antibodies for mutation detection in a large series of cases. Mutation status was determined using the OncoCarta assay in 754 cutaneous melanomas. IHC with the anti-BRAF(V600E) antibody was performed in all cases, and the anti-NRAS(Q61R) and anti-NRAS(Q61L) antibodies were assessed in a subset of 302 samples utilizing tissue microarrays. The staining with the anti-BRAF(V600E) and anti-NRAS(Q61R) antibodies was diffuse, homogeneous and cytoplasmic. The anti-NRAS(Q61L) antibody displayed variable intensity staining, ranging from weak to strong in NRAS(Q61L) mutant tumours. The sensitivity and specificity for anti-BRAF(V600E) was 100 and 99.3%, anti-NRAS(Q61R) was 100 and 100% and anti-NRAS(Q61L) was 82.6 and 96.2%, respectively. The use of IHC is a fast, efficient and cost-effective method to identify single specific mutations in melanoma patients. BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61R) antibodies have high sensitivity and specificity; however, the NRAS(Q61L) antibody appears less sensitive. IHC can help to facilitate the timely, appropriate selection and treatment of metastatic melanoma patients with targeted therapies. Detection of melanoma-associated mutations by IHC may also provide evidence for a diagnosis of melanoma in metastatic undifferentiated neoplasms lacking expression of melanoma antigens.	4
Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity of the First Oxaliplatin Pt(IV) Derivative Having a TSPO Ligand in the Axial Position. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Cycle Humans Ligands MCF-7 Cells Organoplatinum Compounds Oxaliplatin Protein Binding Rats Receptors, GABA || The first Pt(IV) derivative of oxaliplatin carrying a ligand for TSPO (the 18-kDa mitochondrial translocator protein) has been developed. The expression of the translocator protein in the brain and liver of healthy humans is usually low, oppositely to steroid-synthesizing and rapidly proliferating tissues, where TSPO is much more abundant. The novel Pt(IV) complex, cis,trans,cis-[Pt(ethanedioato)Cl{2-(2-(4-(6,8-dichloro-3-(2-(dipropylamino)-2-oxoethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-2-yl)phenoxy)acetate)-ethanolato}(1R,2R-DACH)] (DACH = diaminocyclohexane), has been fully characterized by spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques and tested in vitro against human MCF7 breast carcinoma, U87 glioblastoma, and LoVo colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. In addition, affinity for TSPO (IC50 = 18.64 nM), cellular uptake (ca. 2 times greater than that of oxaliplatin in LoVo cancer cells, after 24 h treatment), and perturbation of cell cycle progression were investigated. Although the new compound was less active than oxaliplatin and did not exploit a synergistic proapoptotic effect due to the presence of the TSPO ligand, it appears to be promising in a receptor-mediated drug targeting context towards TSPO-overexpressing tumors, in particular colorectal cancer (IC50 = 2.31 μM after 72 h treatment).	0
Utility of Genomic Analysis In Circulating Tumor DNA from Patients with Carcinoma of Unknown Primary. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA, Neoplasm Female Genomics Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms, Unknown Primary Young Adult || Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) is a rare and difficult-to-treat malignancy, the management of which might be improved by the identification of actionable driver mutations. We interrogated 54 to 70 genes in 442 patients with CUP using targeted clinical-grade, next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Overall, 80% of patients exhibited ctDNA alterations; 66% (290/442) ≥1 characterized alteration(s), excluding variants of unknown significance. TP53-associated genes were most commonly altered [37.8% (167/442)], followed by genes involved in the MAPK pathway [31.2% (138/442)], PI3K signaling [18.1% (80/442)], and the cell-cycle machinery [10.4% (46/442)]. Among 290 patients harboring characterized alterations, distinct genomic profiles were observed in 87.9% (255/290) of CUP cases, with 99.7% (289/290) exhibiting potentially targetable alterations. An illustrative patient with dynamic changes in ctDNA content during therapy and a responder given a checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen because of a mismatch repair gene anomaly are presented. Our results demonstrate that ctDNA evaluation is feasible in CUP and that most patients harbor a unique somatic profile with pharmacologically actionable alterations, justifying the inclusion of noninvasive liquid biopsies in next-generation clinical trials.Cancer Res; 77(16); 4238-46. ©2017 AACR.	4
γH2AX and Chk1 phosphorylation as predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers of Chk1 inhibitor-chemotherapy combination treatments. || Antineoplastic Agents Biomarkers Cell Line, Tumor Checkpoint Kinase 1 DNA Damage Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Histones Humans Mutation Neoplasms Pharmacogenetics Phosphorylation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Protein Kinases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Chk1 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials in combination with a range of cytotoxic agents and have the potential to potentiate the clinical activity of a large number of standard of care chemotherapeutic agents. Utilizing pharmacodynamic biomarkers to optimize drug dose and scheduling in these trials could greatly enhance the likelihood of clinical success. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro potentiation of the cytotoxicity of a range of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs by the novel Chk1 inhibitor V158411 in p53 mutant colon cancer cells. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers were evaluated in vitro. V158411 potentiated the cytotoxicity of a range of chemotherapeutic agents with distinct mechanisms of action in p53 mutant colon cancer cell lines grown in anchorage dependent or independent culture conditions. Analysis of pharmacodynamic biomarker changes identified dependencies on the chemotherapeutic agent, the concentration of the chemotherapeutic and the duration of time between combination treatment and biomarker analysis. A reduction in total Chk1 and S296/S317/S345 phosphorylation occurred consistently with all cytotoxics in combination with V158411 but did not predict cell line potentiation. Induction of γH2AX levels was chemotherapeutic dependent and correlated closely with potentiation of gemcitabine and camptothecin in p53 mutant colon cancer cells. Our results suggest that Chk1 phosphorylation could be a useful biomarker for monitoring inhibition of Chk1 activity in clinical trials involving a range of V158411-chemotherapy combinations and γH2AX induction as a predictor of potentiation in combinations containing gemcitabine or camptothecin.	0
Frequency of unrecognized Fabry disease among young European-American and African-American men with first ischemic stroke. || Adolescent Adult African Americans Baltimore Brain Ischemia Case-Control Studies European Continental Ancestry Group Fabry Disease Humans Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Genetic Prevalence Risk Factors Stroke Washington Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || The cause of initial ischemic stroke in up to 30% of young patients remains unclear. Fabry disease, due to deficient alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) activity, is a vascular endothelial glycosphingolipid storage disease typically presenting in childhood. With advancing age, patients develop renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular disease and die prematurely. A European study suggested an increased prevalence of unrecognized Fabry disease in patients with cryptogenic stroke. We hypothesized that alpha-Gal A deficiency is a rare cause of initial early-onset ischemic stroke in men. The Stroke Prevention in Young Men Study enrolled >550 men (15 to 49 years) with first ischemic stroke in the Baltimore-Washington area in 2004 to 2007. Frozen plasma samples were assayed for alpha-Gal A activity, and DNA from patients with consistently low plasma alpha-Gal A activities were sequenced. The study sample consisted of 558 men (42% African-American; median age 44 years). Stroke was cryptogenic in 154 men (40% African-American). In 10 patients with low plasma alpha-Gal A activities, DNA sequencing identified alterations in the alpha-Gal A gene in 2 patients. The polymorphism, D313Y, which results in low plasma enzyme activity, but near normal levels of cellular activity was seen in one European-American male. The Fabry disease-causing A143T mutation was seen in an African-American male with cryptogenic stroke (0.18% of all strokes: upper 95% CI=0.53%; 0.65% of cryptogenic strokes: upper 95% CI=1.92%). In this biracial population, unrecognized Fabry disease is a rare but treatable cause of initial ischemic stroke in young men.	3
Single-Molecule characterization of oligomerization kinetics and equilibria of the tumor suppressor p53. || DNA Dimerization Kinetics Protein Multimerization Spectrometry, Fluorescence Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The state of oligomerization of the tumor suppressor p53 is an important factor in its various biological functions. It has a well-defined tetramerization domain, and the protein exists as monomers, dimers and tetramers in equilibrium. The dissociation constants between oligomeric forms are so low that they are at the limits of measurement by conventional methods in vitro. Here, we have used the high sensitivity of single-molecule methods to measure the equilibria and kinetics of oligomerization of full-length p53 and its isolated tetramerization domain, p53tet, at physiological temperature, pH and ionic strength using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in vitro. The dissociation constant at 37 °C for tetramers dissociating into dimers for full-length p53 was 50 ± 7 nM, and the corresponding value for dimers into monomers was 0.55 ± 0.08 nM. The half-lives for the two processes were 20 and 50 min, respectively. The equivalent quantities for p53tet were 150 ± 10 nM, 1.0 ± 0.14 nM, 2.5 ± 0.4 min and 13 ± 2 min. The data suggest that unligated p53 in unstressed cells should be predominantly dimeric. Single-molecule FCS is a useful procedure for measuring dissociation equilibria, kinetics and aggregation at extreme sensitivity.	0
In silico identification of rescue sites by double force scanning. || Computer Simulation Mutation Protein Conformation Protein Domains Proteins Sequence Analysis, Protein Software || A deleterious amino acid change in a protein can be compensated by a second-site rescue mutation. These compensatory mechanisms can be mimicked by drugs. In particular, the location of rescue mutations can be used to identify protein regions that can be targeted by small molecules to reactivate a damaged mutant. We present the first general computational method to detect rescue sites. By mimicking the effect of mutations through the application of forces, the double force scanning (DFS) method identifies the second-site residues that make the protein structure most resilient to the effect of pathogenic mutations. We tested DFS predictions against two datasets containing experimentally validated and putative evolutionary-related rescue sites. A remarkably good agreement was found between predictions and experimental data. Indeed, almost half of the rescue sites in p53 was correctly predicted by DFS, with 65% of remaining sites in contact with DFS predictions. Similar results were found for other proteins in the evolutionary dataset. The DFS code is available under GPL at https://fornililab.github.io/dfs/. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	0
Founder populations and their uses for breast cancer genetics. || Adult Aged BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Female Genes, BRCA1 Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Penetrance Probability Risk Factors Transcription Factors || Numerous founder mutations have been reported in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For genetic screening of a population with a founder mutation, testing can be targeted to the mutation, allowing for a more rapid and less expensive test. In addition, more precise estimates of the prior probability of carrying a mutation and of the likelihood of a mutation carrier developing cancer should be possible. For a given founder mutation a large number of carriers are available, so that focused scientific studies of penetrance, expression, and genetic and environmental modifiers of risk can be performed. Finally, founder populations may be a powerful resource to localize additional breast cancer susceptibility loci, because of the reduction in locus heterogeneity.	4
Mutant p53R273H attenuates the expression of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes and promotes the survival of cells with high levels of reactive oxygen species. || Amino Acid Substitution Apoptosis Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Colonic Neoplasms Gene Knockdown Techniques HCT116 Cells Heme Oxygenase-1 Humans Maleates Metabolic Detoxication, Phase II Mutant Proteins Mutation NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone) NF-E2-Related Factor 2 Oxidative Stress RNA, Small Interfering Reactive Oxygen Species Superoxides Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Uncontrolled accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress and induces harmful effects. Both high ROS levels and p53 mutations are frequent in human cancer. Mutant p53 forms are known to actively promote malignant growth. However, no mechanistic details are known about the contribution of mutant p53 to excessive ROS accumulation in cancer cells. Herein, we examine the effect of p53(R273H), a commonly occurring mutated p53 form, on the expression of phase 2 ROS-detoxifying enzymes and on the ability of cells to readopt a reducing environment after exposure to oxidative stress. Our data suggest that p53(R273H) mutant interferes with the normal response of human cells to oxidative stress. We show here that, upon oxidative stress, mutant p53(R273H) attenuates the activation and function of NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor that induces the antioxidant response. This effect of mutant p53 is manifested by decreased expression of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes NQO1 and HO-1 and high ROS levels. These findings were observed in several human cancer cell lines, highlighting the general nature of this phenomenon. The failure of p53(R273H) mutant-expressing cells to restore a reducing oxidative environment was accompanied by increased survival, a known consequence of mutant p53 expression. These activities are attributable to mutant p53(R273H) gain of function and might underlie its well-documented oncogenic nature in human cancer.	0
Clinical Analysis of Algerian Patients with Pompe Disease. ||  || Pompe's disease is a metabolic myopathy caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), also called acid maltase, an enzyme that degrades lysosomal glycogen. The clinical presentation of Pompe's disease is variable with respect to the age of onset and rate of disease progression. Patients with onset of symptoms in early infancy (infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD)) typically exhibit rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and marked muscle weakness. Most of them die within the first year of life from cardiac and/or respiratory failure. In the majority of cases of Pompe's disease, onset of symptoms occurs after infancy, ranging widely from the first to sixth decade of life (late-onset Pompe's disease or LOPD). Progression of the disease is relentless and patients eventually progress to loss of ambulation and death due to respiratory failure. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical presentation of 6 patients (3 with EOPD and the other 3 with LOPD) of 5 families from the East of Algeria. All our patients were diagnosed as having Pompe's disease based on biochemical confirmations of GAA deficiency by dried blood spots (DBS) and GAA gene mutations were analyzed in all patients who consented (n = 4). Our results are similar to other ethnic groups.	1
Parkinson-Related LRRK2 Mutation R1628P Enables Cdk5 Phosphorylation of LRRK2 and Upregulates Its Kinase Activity. || 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium Amino Acid Sequence Animals Cells, Cultured Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 HEK293 Cells Herbicides Humans Immunoblotting Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2 Mice, Knockout Mice, Transgenic Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense Neurons Parkinson Disease Phosphorylation Protein Binding Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Serine Up-Regulation || Recent studies have linked certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene with Parkinson's disease (PD). Among the mutations, LRRK2 c.4883G>C (R1628P) variant was identified to have a significant association with the risk of PD in ethnic Han-Chinese populations. But the molecular pathological mechanisms of R1628P mutation in PD is still unknown. Unlike other LRRK2 mutants in the Roc-COR-Kinase domain, the R1628P mutation didn't alter the LRRK2 kinase activity and promote neuronal death directly. LRRK2 R1628P mutation increased the binding affinity of LRRK2 with Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Interestingly, R1628P mutation turned its adjacent amino acid residue S1627 on LRRK2 protein to a novel phosphorylation site of Cdk5, which could be defined as a typical type II (+) phosphorylation-related single nucleotide polymorphism. Importantly, we showed that the phosphorylation of S1627 by Cdk5 could activate the LRRK2 kinase, and neurons ectopically expressing R1628P displayed a higher sensitivity to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, a bioactive metabolite of environmental toxin MPTP, in a Cdk5-dependent manner. Our data indicate that Parkinson-related LRRK2 mutation R1628P leads to Cdk5 phosphorylation of LRRK2 at S1627, which would upregulate the kinase activity of LRRK2 and consequently cause neuronal death.	0
Whole-genome sequencing provides new insights into the clonal architecture of Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. || Adenocarcinoma Aged Barrett Esophagus DNA Copy Number Variations DNA Mutational Analysis Disease Progression Esophageal Neoplasms Female Genome, Human Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || The molecular genetic relationship between esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus, is poorly understood. Using whole-genome sequencing on 23 paired Barrett's esophagus and EAC samples, together with one in-depth Barrett's esophagus case study sampled over time and space, we have provided the following new insights: (i) Barrett's esophagus is polyclonal and highly mutated even in the absence of dysplasia; (ii) when cancer develops, copy number increases and heterogeneity persists such that the spectrum of mutations often shows surprisingly little overlap between EAC and adjacent Barrett's esophagus; and (iii) despite differences in specific coding mutations, the mutational context suggests a common causative insult underlying these two conditions. From a clinical perspective, the histopathological assessment of dysplasia appears to be a poor reflection of the molecular disarray within the Barrett's epithelium, and a molecular Cytosponge technique overcomes sampling bias and has the capacity to reflect the entire clonal architecture.	4
Targeted sequencing reveals TP53 as a potential diagnostic biomarker in the post-treatment surveillance of head and neck cancer. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Bone Neoplasms Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Circulating Tumor DNA Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18 DNA Mutational Analysis F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7 Female Head and Neck Neoplasms High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Liquid Biopsy Liver Neoplasms Lung Neoplasms Lymphatic Metastasis Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins Retrospective Studies Skin Neoplasms Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck Tumor Burden Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases || Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) form a large heterogeneous group of tumors and have a relatively poor outcome in advanced cases. Revealing the underlying genetic mutations in HNSCC facilitates the development of diagnostic biomarkers, which might lead to improved diagnosis and post treatment surveillance. We retrospectively analyzed mutational hotspots using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 239 HNSCC tumor samples in order to examine the mutational profile of HNSCC. Furthermore, we assessed prevalence, co-occurrence, and synonymy of gene mutations in (matched) tumor samples. TP53 was found mutated the most frequent with mutation rates of up to 83% in all tumors, compared to mutation rates of between 0 and 21% of CDKN2A, PIK3CA, HRAS, CDK4, FBXW7 and RB1. Mutational co-occurrence predominantly existed between TP53 and PIK3CA, TP53 and CDKN2A, and HRAS and PIK3CA. Mutational synonymy between primary tumor and associated metastasis and recurrence was present in respectively 88% and 89%. TP53 mutations were concordantly mutated in 95% of metastases and in 91% of recurrences. This indicates TP53 mutations to be highly prevalent and concordant in primary tumors and associated locoregional metastases and recurrences. In turn, this provides ground for further investigating the use of TP53 mutations as diagnostic biomarkers in HNSCC patients.	4
P53- and mevalonate pathway-driven malignancies require Arf6 for metastasis and drug resistance. || ADP-Ribosylation Factors Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition HEK293 Cells Humans MCF-7 Cells Mevalonic Acid Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 gamma-Glutamyltransferase rab GTP-Binding Proteins || Drug resistance, metastasis, and a mesenchymal transcriptional program are central features of aggressive breast tumors. The GTPase Arf6, often overexpressed in tumors, is critical to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasiveness. The metabolic mevalonate pathway (MVP) is associated with tumor invasiveness and known to prenylate proteins, but which prenylated proteins are critical for MVP-driven cancers is unknown. We show here that MVP requires the Arf6-dependent mesenchymal program. The MVP enzyme geranylgeranyl transferase II (GGT-II) and its substrate Rab11b are critical for Arf6 trafficking to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Consistently, mutant p53, which is known to support tumorigenesis via MVP, promotes Arf6 activation via GGT-II and Rab11b. Inhibition of MVP and GGT-II blocked invasion and metastasis and reduced cancer cell resistance against chemotherapy agents, but only in cells overexpressing Arf6 and components of the mesenchymal program. Overexpression of Arf6 and mesenchymal proteins as well as enhanced MVP activity correlated with poor patient survival. These results provide insights into the molecular basis of MVP-driven malignancy.	0
Mutational profiling of non-small-cell lung cancer patients resistant to first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors using next generation sequencing. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cohort Studies Crown Ethers DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Library High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Quinazolines || Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring sensitive epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations invariably develop acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Identification of actionable genetic alterations conferring drug-resistance can be helpful for guiding the subsequent treatment decision. One of the major resistant mechanisms is secondary EGFR-T790M mutation. Other mechanisms, such as HER2 and MET amplifications, and PIK3CA mutations, were also reported. However, the mechanisms in the remaining patients are still unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling in a cohort of 83 NSCLC patients with TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations at diagnosis and acquired resistance to three different first-generation EGFR TKIs using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of 416 cancer-related genes. In total, we identified 322 genetic alterations with a median of 3 mutations per patient. 61% of patients still exhibit TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations, and 36% of patients acquired EGFR-T790M. Besides other known resistance mechanisms, we identified TET2 mutations in 12% of patients. Interestingly, we also observed SOX2 amplification in EGFR-T790M negative patients, which are restricted to Icotinib treatment resistance, a drug widely used in Chinese NSCLC patients. Our study uncovered mutational profiles of NSCLC patients with first-generation EGFR TKIs resistance with potential therapeutic implications.	4
Co-occurring SHOC2 and PTPN11 mutations in a patient with severe/complex Noonan syndrome-like phenotype. || Base Sequence Child DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Noonan Syndrome Pedigree Phenotype Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 || Noonan syndrome (NS) is a heterogeneous disorder caused by activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. It is associated with variable clinical expression including short stature, congenital heart defect, unusual pectus deformity, and typical facial features and the inheritance is autosomal dominant. Here, we present a clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair phenotype and additional features including mild psychomotor developmental delay, osteoporosis, gingival hyperplasia, spinal neuroblastoma, intrathoracic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and liver hemangioma. Mutation analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, NRAS, and SHOC2 was conducted, revealing a co-occurrence of two heterozygous previously identified mutations in the index patient. The mutation SHOC2 c.4A > G; p.Ser2Gly represents a de novo mutation, whereas, PTPN11 c.1226G > C; p.Gly409Ala was inherited from the mother and also identified in the brother. The mother and the brother present with some NS manifestations, such as short stature, delayed puberty, keratosis pilaris, café-au-lait spots, refraction error (mother), and undescended testis (brother), but no NS facial features, supporting the notion that the PTPN11 p.Gly409Ala mutation leads to a relatively mild phenotype. We propose that, the atypical phenotype of the young woman with NS reported here is an additive effect, where the PTPN11 mutation acts as a modifier. Interestingly, co-occurrence of RAS-MAPK mutations has been previously identified in a few patients with variable NS or neurofibromatosis-NS phenotypes. Taken together, the results suggest that co-occurrence of mutations or modifying loci in the RAS-MAPK pathway may contribute to the clinical variability observed among NS patients.	4
In silico thermodynamics stability change analysis involved in BH4 responsive mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase: QM/MM and MD simulations analysis. || Biopterin Catalytic Domain Humans Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation, Missense Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Protein Folding Protein Structure, Secondary Quantum Theory Thermodynamics || The mammalian tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-dependent phenylalanine hydroxylases (PAH), involved in important metabolic pathways of phenylalanine, belong to non-heme iron-containing aromatic acid hydroxylases' enzyme (AAH) family. AAHs utilize BH4 as protein co-factor and thus promote hydroxylation reactions of their substrates. Any alterations in BH4 -mediated AAH's pathway or mutations in these enzymes are responsible for various disorders, and thus highlights the importance of mutational analysis to assess the effect on their biosynthetic pathways. Our present studies are aimed at single-site mutations in PAH that lead to thermodynamic stability change upon folding and further validation of designed non-reduced BH2 designed co-factors. We have presented single-site mutational analysis of PAH where single-site mutations have been identified from known literature. Further, in silico studies with the PAH, in silico mutant PAH, and crystallized known mutant A313T forms, involved QM/MM and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations analysis. The modified co-factor A showed high affinity with PAH and all mutant PAH with high G-score of -14.851. The best pose high affinity co-factor A subjected to QM/MM optimization which leads to square-pyramidal coordination of non-heme active site. The structural and energetic information obtained from the production phase of 20 ns MD simulation of co-factor-metalloprotein complex results helped to understand the binding mode and involvement of three molecules throughout the reaction pathways' catalysis of PAH. The free energies of binding (dG) of A were found to be -68.181 kcal/mol and -72.249 for 1DMW and 1TDW for A313T mutant. Binding of Co-factor A do not perturb the coordination environment of iron at the active site which resides in 2-Histdine and 1-Glutamate triad, and may enhance the percentage response towards co-factor-mediated therapy.	0

More recently, somatic mutations in ERBB2 have been reported in 1% to 2% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Previous case series have suggested clinical tumor responses using anti-ERBB2 small molecules and antibody therapies. Here we report the outcomes of nine patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with ERBB2 mutations being treated with ERBB2-targeted therapies. Four of the nine patients had response to targeted therapies, with durations of response ranging from 3 to 10 months. We identified a de novo phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha gene (PIK3CA) mutation and ERBB2 copy number gain as potential resistance mechanisms. We showed patients with ERBB2-mutated lung adenocarcinoma can respond to targeted therapies, and we identified potential resistance mechanisms upon progression to targeted therapies.	4
Global identification of hnRNP A1 binding sites for SSO-based splicing modulation. || A549 Cells Base Sequence Binding Sites Cross-Linking Reagents Exons Genetic Predisposition to Disease HEK293 Cells HeLa Cells Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1 Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B Humans Immunoprecipitation Models, Biological Nucleotides Oligonucleotides RNA Splice Sites RNA Splicing Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid Transcriptome || Many pathogenic genetic variants have been shown to disrupt mRNA splicing. Besides splice mutations in the well-conserved splice sites, mutations in splicing regulatory elements (SREs) may deregulate splicing and cause disease. A promising therapeutic approach is to compensate for this deregulation by blocking other SREs with splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs). However, the location and sequence of most SREs are not well known. Here, we used individual-nucleotide resolution crosslinking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to establish an in vivo binding map for the key splicing regulatory factor hnRNP A1 and to generate an hnRNP A1 consensus binding motif. We find that hnRNP A1 binding in proximal introns may be important for repressing exons. We show that inclusion of the alternative cassette exon 3 in SKA2 can be significantly increased by SSO-based treatment which blocks an iCLIP-identified hnRNP A1 binding site immediately downstream of the 5' splice site. Because pseudoexons are well suited as models for constitutive exons which have been inactivated by pathogenic mutations in SREs, we used a pseudoexon in MTRR as a model and showed that an iCLIP-identified hnRNP A1 binding site downstream of the 5' splice site can be blocked by SSOs to activate the exon. The hnRNP A1 binding map can be used to identify potential targets for SSO-based therapy. Moreover, together with the hnRNP A1 consensus binding motif, the binding map may be used to predict whether disease-associated mutations and SNPs affect hnRNP A1 binding and eventually mRNA splicing.	0
ATM mutations and E-cadherin expression define sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapy in colorectal cancer. || Adult Antibodies, Monoclonal Antigens, CD Antineoplastic Agents Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins Blotting, Western Caco-2 Cells Cadherins Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Cetuximab Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Methylation ErbB Receptors Female HCT116 Cells HT29 Cells Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Panitumumab Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA Interference || EGFR-targeted therapy is a key treatment approach in patients with RAS wildtype metastatic colorectal cancers (CRC). Still, also RAS wildtype CRC may be resistant to EGFR-targeted therapy, with few predictive markers available for improved stratification of patients. Here, we investigated response of 7 CRC cell lines (Caco-2, DLD1, HCT116, HT29, LS174T, RKO, SW480) to Cetuximab and correlated this to NGS-based mutation profiles, EGFR promoter methylation and EGFR expression status as well as to E-cadherin expression. Moreover, tissue specimens of primary and/or recurrent tumors as well as liver and/or lung metastases of 25 CRC patients having received Cetuximab and/or Panitumumab were examined for the same molecular markers. In vitro and in situ analyses showed that EGFR promoter methylation and EGFR expression as well as the MSI and or CIMP-type status did not guide treatment responses. In fact, EGFR-targeted treatment responses were also observed in RAS exon 2 p.G13 mutated CRC cell lines or CRC cases and were further linked to PIK3CA exon 9 mutations. In contrast, non-response to EGFR-targeted treatment was associated with ATM mutations and low E-cadherin expression. Moreover, down-regulation of E-cadherin by siRNA in otherwise Cetuximab responding E-cadherin positive cells abrogated their response. Hence, we here identify ATM and E-cadherin expression as potential novel supportive predictive markers for EGFR-targeted therapy.	4
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in human subjects with function-altering melanocortin-4 receptor variants. || Adolescent Adult Arizona Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Hispanic Americans Humans Hypothalamus Indians, North American Longitudinal Studies Male Mutation Obesity Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Promoter Regions, Genetic Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 || In rodents, hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression appears to be regulated by melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) activity. The impact of MC4R genetic variation on circulating BDNF in humans is unknown. The objective of this study is to compare BDNF concentrations of subjects with loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) MC4R variants with those of controls with common sequence MC4R. Circulating BDNF was measured in two cohorts with known MC4R sequence: 148 subjects of Pima Indian heritage ((mean±s.d.): age, 15.7±6.5 years; body mass index z-scores (BMI-Z), 1.63±1.03) and 69 subjects of Hispanic heritage (10.8±3.6 years; BMI-Z, 1.57±1.07). MC4R variants were characterized in vitro by cell surface expression, receptor binding and cyclic AMP response after agonist administration. BDNF single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12291186, rs6265 and rs7124442 were also genotyped. In the Pima cohort, no significant differences in serum BDNF was observed for 43 LOF subjects versus 65 LOF-matched controls (age, sex and BMI matched; P=0.29) or 20 GOF subjects versus 20 GOF-matched controls (P=0.40). Serum BDNF was significantly associated with genotype for BDNF rs12291186 (P=0.006) and rs6265 (P=0.009), but not rs7124442 (P=0.99); BDNF SNPs did not interact with MC4R status to predict serum BDNF. In the Hispanic cohort, plasma BDNF was not significantly different among 21 LOF subjects, 20 GOF subjects and 28 controls (P=0.79); plasma BDNF was not predicted by BDNF genotype or BDNF-x-MC4R genotype interaction. Circulating BDNF concentrations were not significantly associated with MC4R functional status, suggesting that peripheral BDNF does not directly reflect hypothalamic BDNF secretion and/or that MC4R signaling is not a significant regulator of the bulk of BDNF expression in humans.	4
Development of a genetic sensor that eliminates p53 deficient cells. || Animals Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Biosensing Techniques Cell Line, Transformed Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Female Ganciclovir Gene Knockout Techniques HCT116 Cells HEK293 Cells Humans Male Mice Mice, Knockout Mice, Nude Mutation Neoplasm Transplantation Promoter Regions, Genetic Proto-Oncogene Proteins Simplexvirus Thymidine Kinase Transplantation, Heterologous Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The TP53 gene fulfills a central role in protecting cells from genetic insult. Given this crucial role it might be surprising that p53 itself is not essential for cell survival. Indeed, TP53 is the single most mutated gene across different cancer types. Thus, both a theoretical and a question of significant practical applicability arise: can cells be programmed to make TP53 an essential gene? Here we present a genetic p53 sensor, in which the loss of p53 is coupled to the rise of HSV-TK expression. We show that the sensor can distinguish both p53 knockout and cells expressing a common TP53 cancer mutation from otherwise isogenic TP53 wild-type cells. Importantly, the system is sensitive enough to specifically target TP53 loss-of-function cells with the HSV-TK pro-drug Ganciclovir both in vitro and in vivo. Our work opens new ways to programming cell intrinsic transformation protection systems that rely on endogenous components.	0
A Temperature Sensitive Variant of p53 Drives p53-Dependent MicroRNA Expression without Evidence of Widespread Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing. || Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Silencing Humans MicroRNAs RNA, Neoplasm Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 tumour suppressor is a transcription factor that can regulate the expression of numerous genes including many encoding proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs). The predominant outcomes of a typical p53 response are the initiation of apoptotic cascades and the activation of cell cycle checkpoints. HT29-tsp53 cells express a temperature sensitive variant of p53 and in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, these cells preferentially undergo G1 phase cell cycle arrest at the permissive temperature that correlates with increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1. Recent evidence also suggests that a variety of miRNAs can induce G1 arrest by inhibiting the expression of proteins like CDK4 and CDK6. Here we used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify p53-regulated miRNAs that are induced in these cells undergoing G1 arrest. At the permissive temperature, the expression of several miRNAs was increased through a combination of either transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. In particular, miR-34a-5p, miR-143-3p and miR-145-5p were strongly induced and they reached levels comparable to that of reference miRNAs (miR-191 and miR-103). Importantly, miR-34a-5p and miR-145-5p are known to silence the Cdk4 and/or Cdk6 G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). Surprisingly, there was no p53-dependent decrease in the expression of either of these G1 cdks. To search for other potential targets of p53-regulated miRNAs, p53-downregulated mRNAs were identified through parallel microarray analysis of mRNA expression. Once again, there was no clear effect of p53 on the repression of mRNAs under these conditions despite a remarkable increase in p53-induced mRNA expression. Therefore, despite a strong p53 transcriptional response, there was no clear evidence that p53-responsive miRNA contributed to gene silencing. Taken together, the changes in cell cycle distribution in this cell line at the permissive temperature is likely attributable to transcriptional upregulation of the CDKN1A mRNA and p21WAF1 protein and not to the down regulation of CDK4 or CDK6 by p53-regulated miRNAs.	0
Wild-type p53 binds to MYC promoter G-quadruplex. || Circular Dichroism DNA DNA-Binding Proteins G-Quadruplexes Gene Expression Regulation HCT116 Cells Humans Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || G-quadruplexes are four-stranded nucleic acid structures that are implicated in the regulation of transcription, translation and replication. Genome regions enriched in putative G-quadruplex motifs include telomeres and gene promoters. Tumour suppressor p53 plays a critical role in regulatory pathways leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. In addition to transcriptional regulation mediated via sequence-specific DNA binding, p53 can selectively bind various non-B DNA structures. In the present study, wild-type p53 (wtp53) binding to G-quadruplex formed by MYC promoter nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE) III1 region was investigated. Wtp53 binding to MYC G-quadruplex is comparable to interaction with specific p53 consensus sequence (p53CON). Apart from the full-length wtp53, its isolated C-terminal region (aa 320-393) as well, is capable of high-affinity MYC G-quadruplex binding, suggesting its critical role in this type of interaction. Moreover, wtp53 binds to MYC promoter region containing putative G-quadruplex motif in two wtp53-expressing cell lines. The results suggest that wtp53 binding to G-quadruplexes can take part in transcriptional regulation of its target genes.	0

Samples from 120 patients who were negative for BRCA1/2 mutations, but had been diagnosed with breast cancer that was likely hereditary, were prospectively evaluated for the prevalence of high-penetrance and moderate-penetrance germline mutations. Nine patients (7.5%) had at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Ten variants were identified in these patients: TP53 in two patients, PALB2 in three patients, BARD1 in two patients, BRIP1 in two patients, and MRE11A in one patient. We also identified 30 types of 139 variants of unknown significance (VUS). High-penetrance germline mutations, including TP53 and PALB2, tended to occur with high frequency in young (< 35 years) breast cancer patients (4/19, 21.1%) than in those diagnosed with breast cancer at ≥35 years of age (1/101, 1.0%; p = 0.003). These combined results demonstrate that multigene panels offer an alternative strategy for identifying veiled pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes.	4
Mutant p53 R248Q but not R248W enhances in vitro invasiveness of human lung cancer NCI-H1299 cells. || Alleles Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Line, Tumor Codon Genes, p53 Humans Loss of Heterozygosity Lung Neoplasms Point Mutation Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || More than half of all human cancers are associated with mutations of the TP53 gene. In regard to the functional interaction with the remaining wild-type (WT) p53 allele, p53 mutations are classified into two types, recessive and dominant-negative (DN) mutations. The latter mutant protein has a DN activity over the remaining WT allele. We previously showed that the DN p53 mutant was useful as a predictor of poor outcome or a risk factor for metastatic recurrence in patients with some types of cancers, regardless of the presence or absence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of WT p53, suggesting that the DN p53 had 'gain-of-function (GOF)' activity besides the transdominance function. In this study, we investigated GOF activity of two DN p53 mutants which had a point mutation at codon 248 (R248Q and R248W), one of the hot spots, by transfecting them respectively into H1299 cells which originally expressed no p53 protein. Growth activity of the transfectants with the two mutants was not different from that of parent or Mock transfectants. Meanwhile, in vitro invasions of Matrigel and type I collagen gel by R248Q-transfectants were significantly higher than those by R248W-transfectants or the control cells. However, there were no differences in cell motile activities, expressions of extracellular matrix-degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and heparanase, and their inhibitors, between R248Q- and R248W-transfectants. These findings indicate that the p53 mutants have a different quality in GOF activities even if the mutations occurred at the same codon. And detailed information of the status of p53, including transdominancy and GOF activity, is expected to be useful for diagnosis and therapeutic strategy fitting the individual patients.	0
Prexasertib, a Chk1/Chk2 inhibitor, increases the effectiveness of conventional therapy in B-/T- cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. || Adenine Nucleotides Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Arabinonucleosides Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Checkpoint Kinase 1 Checkpoint Kinase 2 Clofarabine Dasatinib Drug Synergism Humans Imatinib Mesylate Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Protein Kinase Inhibitors Pyrazines Pyrazoles || During the last few years many Checkpoint kinase 1/2 (Chk1/Chk2) inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of different type of cancers. In this study we evaluated the efficacy of the Chk 1/2 inhibitor prexasertib mesylate monohydrate in B-/T- cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as single agent and in combination with other drugs. The prexasertib reduced the cell viability in a dose and time dependent manner in all the treated cell lines. The cytotoxic activity was confirmed by the increment of apoptotic cells (Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining), by the increase of γH2A.X protein expression and by the activation of different apoptotic markers (Parp-1 and pro-Caspase3 cleavage). Furthermore, the inhibition of Chk1 changed the cell cycle profile. In order to evaluate the chemo-sensitizer activity of the compound, different cell lines were treated for 24 and 48 hours with prexasertib in combination with other drugs (imatinib, dasatinib and clofarabine). The results from cell line models were strengthened in primary leukemic blasts isolated from peripheral blood of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. In this study we highlighted the mechanism of action and the effectiveness of prexasertib as single agent or in combination with other conventional drugs like imatinib, dasatinib and clofarabine in the treatment of B-/T-ALL.	0
Diversification of the muscle proteome through alternative splicing. || Alternative Splicing Contractile Proteins Excitation Contraction Coupling Humans MEF2 Transcription Factors Mitochondria, Muscle Muscle Proteins Muscle, Skeletal Muscular Diseases Protein Isoforms Proteome Transcription Factors || Skeletal muscles express a highly specialized proteome that allows the metabolism of energy sources to mediate myofiber contraction. This muscle-specific proteome is partially derived through the muscle-specific transcription of a subset of genes. Surprisingly, RNA sequencing technologies have also revealed a significant role for muscle-specific alternative splicing in generating protein isoforms that give specialized function to the muscle proteome. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge with respect to the mechanisms that allow pre-mRNA transcripts to undergo muscle-specific alternative splicing while identifying some of the key trans-acting splicing factors essential to the process. The importance of specific splicing events to specialized muscle function is presented along with examples in which dysregulated splicing contributes to myopathies. Though there is now an appreciation that alternative splicing is a major contributor to proteome diversification, the emergence of improved "targeted" proteomic methodologies for detection of specific protein isoforms will soon allow us to better appreciate the extent to which alternative splicing modifies the activity of proteins (and their ability to interact with other proteins) in the skeletal muscle. In addition, we highlight a continued need to better explore the signaling pathways that contribute to the temporal control of trans-acting splicing factor activity to ensure specific protein isoforms are expressed in the proper cellular context. An understanding of the signal-dependent and signal-independent events driving muscle-specific alternative splicing has the potential to provide us with novel therapeutic strategies to treat different myopathies.	0
Large heterozygous deletion masquerading as homozygous missense mutation: a pitfall in diagnostic mutation analysis. ||  || The clinical use of molecular analyses in recessive disorders relies on the exact characterization of both mutant alleles in the affected patient. This can be problematic when only part of the gene is examined or when relevant DNA alterations are not recognized by standard methods. We present a child in whom phenylketonuria was apparently caused by homozygosity for the mutation E390G in exon 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. However, the clinical severity of the disease was not quite as mild as expected, the mutation was not identified in the father despite confirmed paternity, and the paternal allele showed a highly unusual pattern of polymorphic markers in the PAH gene. Presence of a large deletion involving exons 9, 10 and 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene was confirmed by long-range PCR. Diagnostic DNA analyses should include a comprehensive examination of the whole relevant gene in the patient and confirmation of carrier status in both parents.	1 3
Muenke syndrome (FGFR3-related craniosynostosis): expansion of the phenotype and review of the literature. || Adult Aged Audiometry Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses Developmental Disabilities Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Sex Factors Speech Disorders Syndrome Tomography, X-Ray Computed || Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Reduced penetrance and variable expressivity contribute to the wide spectrum of clinical findings in Muenke syndrome. To better define the clinical features of this syndrome, we initiated a study of the natural history of Muenke syndrome. To date, we have conducted a standardized evaluation of nine patients with a confirmed Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3. We reviewed audiograms from an additional 13 patients with Muenke syndrome. A majority of the patients (95%) demonstrated a mild-to-moderate, low frequency sensorineural hearing loss. This pattern of hearing loss was not previously recognized as characteristic of Muenke syndrome. We also report on feeding and swallowing difficulties in children with Muenke syndrome. Combining 312 reported cases of Muenke syndrome with data from the nine NIH patients, we found that females with the Pro250Arg mutation were significantly more likely to be reported with craniosynostosis than males (P < 0.01). Based on our findings, we propose that the clinical management should include audiometric and developmental assessment in addition to standard clinical care and appropriate genetic counseling.	4
Tumor suppressor p53 and estrogen receptors in nuclear-mitochondrial communication. || Cell Nucleus Gene Expression Regulation Gene Regulatory Networks Mitochondria Receptors, Estrogen Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Several gene transcription regulators considered solely localized within the nuclear compartment are being reported to be present in the mitochondria as well. There is growing interest in the role of mitochondria in regulating cellular metabolism in normal and disease states. Various findings demonstrate the importance of crosstalk between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes in regulating cellular functions. Both tumor suppressor p53 and estrogen receptor (ER) were originally characterized as nuclear transcription factors. In addition to their individual roles as regulators of various genes, these two proteins interact resulting in major cellular consequences. In addition to its nuclear role, p53 has been localized to the mitochondria where it executes various transcription-independent functions. Likewise, ERs are reported to be present in mitochondria; however their functional roles remain to be clearly defined. In this review, we provide an integrated view of the current knowledge of nuclear and mitochondrial p53 and ERs and how it relates to normal and pathological physiology.	0
Potential genetic predisposition for anthracycline-associated cardiomyopathy in families with dilated cardiomyopathy. ||  || Anthracyclines are successfully used in cancer treatment, but their use is limited by their cardiotoxic side effects. Several risk factors for anthracycline-associated cardiomyopathy (AACM) are known, yet the occurrence of AACM in the absence of these known risk factors suggests that other factors must play a role. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a genetic predisposition for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) could be a potential risk factor for AACM. A hospital-based registry of 162 DCM families and two hospital-based registries of patients with cancer treated with systemic cancer therapy (n>6000) were reviewed focusing on AACM. Selected patients with AACM/DCM families with possible AACM (n=21) were analysed for mutations in cardiomyopathy-associated genes and presymptomatic cardiological evaluation of first-degree relatives was performed. We identified five DCM families with AACM and one patient with AACM with a family member with a possible early sign of mild DCM. Pathogenic MYH7 mutations were identified in two of these six families. The MYH7 c.1633G>A (p.Asp545Asn) and c.2863G>A (p.Asp955Asn) mutations (one double mutant allele) were identified in a DCM family with AACM. The MYH7 c.4125T>A (p.Tyr1375X) mutation was identified in one patient with AACM. This study further extends the hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to DCM could be a potential risk factor for AACM.	4
Identification of the genetic determinants responsible for retinal degeneration in families of Mexican descent. || ARRP LCA Mexican population Retinal degeneration exome sequencing targeted sequencing || To investigate the clinical characteristics and genetic basis of inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) in six unrelated pedigrees from Mexico. A complete ophthalmic evaluation including measurement of visual acuities, Goldman kinetic or Humphrey dynamic perimetry, Amsler test, fundus photography, and color vision testing was performed. Family history and blood samples were collected from available family members. DNA from members of two pedigrees was examined for known mutations using the APEX ARRP genotyping microarray and one pedigree using the APEX LCA genotyping microarray. The remaining three pedigrees were analyzed using a custom-designed targeted capture array covering the exons of 233 known retinal degeneration genes. Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq. Reads were mapped against hg19, and variants were annotated using GATK and filtered by exomeSuite. Segregation and ethnicity-matched control sample analyses were performed by dideoxy sequencing. Six pedigrees with IRD were analyzed. Nine rare or novel, potentially pathogenic variants segregating with the phenotype were detected in IMPDH1, USH2A, RPE65, ABCA4, and FAM161A genes. Among these, six were known mutations while the remaining three changes in USH2A, RPE65, and FAM161A genes have not been previously reported to be associated with IRD. Analysis of 100 ethnicity-matched controls did not detect the presence of these three novel variants indicating, these are rare variants in the Mexican population. Screening patients diagnosed with IRD from Mexico identified six known mutations and three rare or novel potentially damaging variants in IMPDH1, USH2A, RPE65, ABCA4, and FAM161A genes that segregated with disease.	4
Chromothripsis Is a Recurrent Genomic Abnormality in High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Chromosome Aberrations Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 Comparative Genomic Hybridization Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit DNA DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases DNA Copy Number Variations DNA Mutational Analysis DNA-Binding Proteins Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Karyotype Male Middle Aged Myelodysplastic Syndromes Proto-Oncogene Proteins Recurrence Risk Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || To explore novel genetic abnormalities occurring in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) through an integrative study combining array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a series of MDS and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) patients. 301 patients diagnosed with MDS (n = 240) or MDS/MPN (n = 61) were studied at the time of diagnosis. A genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number abnormalities was performed. In addition, a mutational analysis of DNMT3A, TET2, RUNX1, TP53 and BCOR genes was performed by NGS in selected cases. 285 abnormalities were identified in 71 patients (23.6%). Three high-risk MDS cases (1.2%) displayed chromothripsis involving exclusively chromosome 13 and affecting some cancer genes: FLT3, BRCA2 and RB1. All three cases carried TP53 mutations as revealed by NGS. Moreover, in the whole series, the integrative analysis of aCGH and NGS enabled the identification of cryptic recurrent deletions in 2p23.3 (DNMT3A; n = 2.8%), 4q24 (TET2; n = 10%) 17p13 (TP53; n = 8.5%), 21q22 (RUNX1; n = 7%), and Xp11.4 (BCOR; n = 2.8%), while mutations in the non-deleted allele where found only in DNMT3A (n = 1), TET2 (n = 3), and TP53 (n = 4). These cryptic abnormalities were detected mainly in patients with normal (45%) or non-informative (15%) karyotype by conventional cytogenetics, except for those with TP53 deletion and mutation (15%), which had a complex karyotype. In addition to well-known copy number defects, the presence of chromothripsis involving chromosome 13 was a novel recurrent change in high-risk MDS patients. Array CGH analysis revealed the presence of cryptic abnormalities in genomic regions where MDS-related genes, such as TET2, DNMT3A, RUNX1 and BCOR, are located.	4
Combined analysis of three genome-wide association studies on vWF and FVIII plasma levels. || Acid Sensing Ion Channels Adult Cell Adhesion Molecules Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal Degenerin Sodium Channels Epithelial Sodium Channels Factor VIII Female Genome-Wide Association Study Genotype Humans Lectins, C-Type Male Middle Aged Nerve Tissue Proteins Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide R-SNARE Proteins Receptors, Cell Surface Scavenger Receptors, Class A Syntaxin 1 Venous Thrombosis von Willebrand Factor || Elevated levels of factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, in particular venous thrombosis. Although high, the heritability of these traits is poorly explained by the genetic factors known so far. The aim of this work was to identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could influence the variability of these traits. Three independent genome-wide association studies for vWF plasma levels and FVIII activity were conducted and their results were combined into a meta-analysis totalling 1,624 subjects. No single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) reached the study-wide significance level of 1.12 × 10-7 that corresponds to the Bonferroni correction for the number of tested SNPs. Nevertheless, the recently discovered association of STXBP5, STX2, TC2N and CLEC4M genes with vWF levels and that of SCARA5 and STAB2 genes with FVIII levels were confirmed in this meta-analysis. Besides, among the fifteen novel SNPs showing promising association at p < 10-5 with either vWF or FVIII levels in the meta-analysis, one located in ACCN1 gene also showed weak association (P = 0.0056) with venous thrombosis in a sample of 1,946 cases and 1,228 controls. This study has generated new knowledge on genomic regions deserving further investigations in the search for genetic factors influencing vWF and FVIII plasma levels, some potentially implicated in VT, as well as providing some supporting evidence of previously identified genes.	4
[Analysis of common mutations of deafness-related genes in 2725 newborns]. ||  || To screen for common mutations of deafness-related genes in order to determine the carrier rate, types of mutation, and their relevance to hearing loss. For 4 deafness-related genes GJB2, GJB3, 12S rRNA and SLC26A4, 20 common mutations were screened among 2725 newborns from Shaoxing, Zhejiang by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry. Among the 2725 newborns,149 (5.47%) were diagnosed with mutations, which included 84 (3.08%) with GJB2 mutations, 13 (0.48%) with GJB3 mutations, 49 (1.80%) with SLC26A4 mutations and 3 (0.11%) with 12S rRNA mutations. Fourteen mutational hotspots were identified. The most common mutations have included GJB2 c.235delC (65 cases), SLC26A4 IVS7-2A>G (34 cases), GJB2 c.299_300delAT (13 cases), GJB3 c.538C>T (7 cases), GJB2 c.176_191del16 (6 cases) and GJB3 c.547G>A (6 cases). The detecting rate for deafness-related gene mutations has been relatively high. To broaden the screening spectrum may improve such rate. Besides GJB2, 12S rRNA, SLC26A4, GJB3 also features a high mutation rate in the region.	4
[Screening of common deaf genes in pregnant women and prevention of deafness at birth]. ||  || To determine the carrier rate for common mutations causing deafness among pregnant women in order to prevent births of deaf children. For 893 pregnant women, 2 mL peripheral venous blood was taken and DNA was extracted. A deafness DNA microarray screening was applied to such samples, and DNA sequencing was applied to husbands of women with positive screening results. A total of 40 carriers were detected, with the overall mutation rate being 4.48%. Among such carriers, GJB2 235delC was the most common heterozygous mutation (18 cases) and the mutation rate was 2.02%. GJB2 299A-T heterozygous mutation was detected in 7 cases with a mutation rate of 0.78%. IVS7-2A to G heterozygous mutation was detected in 9 cases with a mutation rate of 1.02%. There were 2 cases carrying GJB3 heterozygous mutation and 2 cases of mitochondrial 12S rRNA heterozygous mutation, with a mutation rate of 0.22%. IVS7-2A>G with GJB3 538C>T double heterozygous mutation was detected in 1 case, and IVS7-2A>G with GJB2 299A-T double heterozygous mutation was detected in another case, with the mutation rate of each being 0.11%. DNA sequencing has failed to find presence of mutations in the same gene in the husbands. The results of neonatal hearing follow-up were all normal. Applications of the deaf genes screening in pregnant women may play prove to be valuable for the early detection for neonatal deafness.	4
The genetic basis of familial hypercholesterolemia: inheritance, linkage, and mutations. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder of lipoprotein metabolism characterized by high plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), tendon xanthomas, and increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. FH is one of the most common inherited disorders; there are 10,000,000 people with FH worldwide, mainly heterozygotes. The most common FH cause is mutations along the entire gene that encode for LDL receptor (LDLR) protein, but it has been also described that mutations in apolipoprotein B (APOB) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes produce this phenotype. About 17%-33% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of monogenic hypercholesterolemia do not harbor any genetic cause in the known loci. Because FH has been considered as a public health problem, it is very important for an early diagnosis and treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated the influence of the LDLR mutation type in the FH phenotype, associating a more severe clinical phenotype and worse advanced carotid artherosclerosis in patients with null than those with receptor-defective mutations. Since 2004, a molecular FH diagnosis based on a genetic diagnostic platform (Lipochip(®); Progenika-Biopharma, Derio, Spain) has been developed. This analysis completes the adequate clinical diagnosis made by physicians. Our group has recently proposed new FH guidelines with the intention to facilitate the FH diagnosis. The treatment for this disease is based on the benefit of lowering LDLc and a healthy lifestyle. Actually, drug therapy is focused on using statins and combined therapy with ezetimibe and statins. This review highlights the recent progress made in genetics, diagnosis, and treatment for FH.	4
Comprehensive Molecular Screening in Chinese Usher Syndrome Patients. ||  || Usher syndrome (USH) refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders causing deafness and blindness. The objectives of this study were to determine the mutation spectrum in a cohort of Chinese patients with USH and to describe the clinical features of the patients with mutations. A total of 119 probands who were clinically diagnosed with USH were recruited for genetic analysis. All probands underwent ophthalmic examinations. A combination of molecular screening methods, including targeted next-generation sequencing, Sanger-DNA sequencing, and multiplex ligation probe amplification assay, was used to detect mutations. We found biallelic mutations in 92 probands (77.3%), monoallelic mutations in 5 patients (4.2%), and 1 hemizygous mutation in 1 patient (0.8%), resulting in an overall mutation detection rate of 78.2%. Overall, 132 distinct disease-causing mutations involving seven USH (ABHD12, CDH23, GPR98, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, and USH2A) genes; 5 other retinal degeneration genes (CHM, CNGA1, EYS, PDE6B, and TULP1); and 1 nonsyndromic hearing loss gene (MYO15A) were identified, and 78 were novel. Mutations of MYOA7 were responsible for 60% of USH1 families, followed by PCDH15 (20%) and USH1C (10%). Mutations of USH2A accounted for 67.7% of USH2 families, and mutation c.8559-2A>G was the most frequent one, accounting for 19.1% of the identified USH2A alleles. Our results confirm that the mutation spectrum for each USH gene in Chinese patients differs from those of other populations. The formation of the mutation profile for the Chinese population will enable a precise genetic diagnosis for USH patients in the future.	1
Prevalence of the GJB2 IVS1+1G >A mutation in Chinese hearing loss patients with monoallelic pathogenic mutation in the coding region of GJB2. || Adolescent Adult Aged Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexins Exons Female Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Open Reading Frames Phenotype Prevalence RNA Splice Sites || Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of nonsyndromic recessive hearing loss in China. In about 6% of Chinese patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing impairment, only monoallelic GJB2 mutations known to be either recessive or of unclear pathogenicity have been identified. This paper reports the prevalence of the GJB2 IVS1+1G>A mutation in a population of Chinese hearing loss patients with monoallelic pathogenic mutation in the coding region of GJB2. Two hundred and twelve patients, screened from 7133 cases of nonsyndromic hearing loss in China, with monoallelic mutation (mainly frameshift and nonsense mutation) in the coding region of GJB2 were examined for the GJB2 IVS1+1G>A mutation and mutations in the promoter region of this gene. Two hundred and sixty-two nonsyndromic hearing loss patients without GJB2 mutation and 105 controls with normal hearing were also tested for the GJB2 IVS1+1G>A mutation by sequencing. Four patients with monoallelic mutation in the coding region of GJB2 were found carrying the GJB2 IVS1+1G>A mutation on the opposite allele. One patient with the GJB2 c.235delC mutation carried one variant, -3175 C>T, in exon 1 of GJB2. Neither GJB2 IVS1+1G>A mutation nor any variant in exon 1 of GJB2 was found in the 262 nonsyndromic hearing loss patients without GJB2 mutation or in the 105 normal hearing controls. Testing for the GJB2 IVS 1+1 G to A mutation explained deafness in 1.89% of Chinese GJB2 monoallelic patients, and it should be included in routine testing of patients with GJB2 monoallelic pathogenic mutation.	4
Mutant p53 uses p63 as a molecular chaperone to alter gene expression and induce a pro-invasive secretome. || Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Neoplasm Invasiveness Signal Transduction Transcription Factors Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Transcriptome Tumor Microenvironment Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Mutations in the TP53 gene commonly result in the expression of a full-length protein that drives cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Herein, we have deciphered the global landscape of transcriptional regulation by mutant p53 through the application of a panel of isogenic H1299 derivatives with inducible expression of several common cancer-associated p53 mutants. We found that the ability of mutant p53 to alter the transcriptional profile of cancer cells is remarkably conserved across different p53 mutants. The mutant p53 transcriptional landscape was nested within a small subset of wild-type p53 responsive genes, suggesting that the oncogenic properties of mutant p53 are conferred by retaining its ability to regulate a defined set of p53 target genes. These mutant p53 target genes were shown to converge upon a p63 signalling axis. Both mutant p53 and wild-type p63 were co-recruited to the promoters of these target genes, thus providing a molecular basis for their selective regulation by mutant p53. We demonstrate that mutant p53 manipulates the gene expression pattern of cancer cells to facilitate invasion through the release of a pro-invasive secretome into the tumor microenvironment. Collectively, this study provides mechanistic insight into the complex nature of transcriptional regulation by mutant p53 and implicates a role for tumor-derived p53 mutations in the manipulation of the cancer cell secretome.	0
Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-distal sequences engage CRISPR Cas9 DNA target cleavage. || Animals Base Sequence Cells, Cultured Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats DNA Cleavage Mice Molecular Sequence Data Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid || The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated enzyme Cas9 is an RNA-guided nuclease that has been widely adapted for genome editing in eukaryotic cells. However, the in vivo target specificity of Cas9 is poorly understood and most studies rely on in silico predictions to define the potential off-target editing spectrum. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), we delineate the genome-wide binding panorama of catalytically inactive Cas9 directed by two different single guide (sg) RNAs targeting the Trp53 locus. Cas9:sgRNA complexes are able to load onto multiple sites with short seed regions adjacent to (5')NGG(3') protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM). Yet among 43 ChIP-seq sites harboring seed regions analyzed for mutational status, we find editing only at the intended on-target locus and one off-target site. In vitro analysis of target site recognition revealed that interactions between the 5' end of the guide and PAM-distal target sequences are necessary to efficiently engage Cas9 nucleolytic activity, providing an explanation for why off-target editing is significantly lower than expected from ChIP-seq data.	0
Ellipticine induces apoptosis in T-cell lymphoma via oxidative DNA damage. || Antineoplastic Agents Antioxidants Apoptosis Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor DNA Damage Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Ellipticines G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Humans Lymphoma, T-Cell Molecular Structure Mutation RNA Interference Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 alpha-Tocopherol || The tumor suppressor p53 is often mutated in human cancers. Restoring its antitumor activity has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Here we analyzed the activity and mechanism of a p53 reactivator, ellipticine, in a cellular model of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a disease that is progressive, chemoresistant and refractory to treatment. We tested the effect of ellipticine in three cell lines with different p53 status: MyLa2000 (p53(wt/wt)), SeAx ((G245S)p53) and Hut-78 ((R196Stop)p53). Ellipticine caused apoptosis in MyLa2000 and SeAx and restored the transcriptional activity of (G245S)p53 in SeAx. However, p53 siRNA knockdown experiments revealed that p53 was not required for ellipticine-induced apoptosis in CTCL. The lipophilic antioxidant α-tocopherol inhibited ellipticine-dependent apoptosis and we linked the apoptotic response to the oxidative DNA damage. Our results provide evidence that ellipticine-induced apoptosis is exerted through DNA damage and does not require p53 activation in T-cell lymphoma.	0
Disease-causing missense mutations in human DNA helicase disorders. || Bloom Syndrome Cockayne Syndrome DNA Helicases Fanconi Anemia Humans Mutation, Missense Xeroderma Pigmentosum || Helicases have important roles in nucleic acid metabolism, and their prominence is marked by the discovery of genetic disorders arising from disease-causing mutations. Missense mutations can yield unique insight to molecular functions and basis for disease pathology. XPB or XPD missense mutations lead to Xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, Trichothiodystrophy, or COFS syndrome, suggesting that DNA repair and transcription defects are responsible for clinical heterogeneity. Complex phenotypes are also observed for RECQL4 helicase mutations responsible for Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, Baller-Gerold syndrome, or RAPADILINO. Bloom's syndrome causing missense mutations are found in the conserved helicase and RecQ C-terminal domain of BLM that interfere with helicase function. Although rare, patient-derived missense mutations in the exonuclease or helicase domain of Werner syndrome protein exist. Characterization of WRN separation-of-function mutants may provide insight to catalytic requirements for suppression of phenotypes associated with the premature aging disorder. Characterized FANCJ missense mutations associated with breast cancer or Fanconi anemia interfere with FANCJ helicase activity required for DNA repair and the replication stress response. For example, a FA patient-derived mutation in the FANCJ Iron-Sulfur domain was shown to uncouple its ATPase and translocase activity from DNA unwinding. Mutations in DDX11 (ChlR1) are responsible for Warsaw Breakage syndrome, a recently discovered autosomal recessive cohesinopathy. Ongoing and future studies will address clinically relevant helicase mutations and polymorphisms, including those that interfere with key protein interactions or exert dominant negative phenotypes (e.g., certain mutant alleles of Twinkle mitochondrial DNA helicase). Chemical rescue may be an approach to restore helicase activity in loss-of-function helicase disorders. Genetic and biochemical analyses of disease-causing missense mutations in human helicase disorders have led to new insights to the molecular defects underlying aberrant cellular and clinical phenotypes.	0
Results of contracture tests with halothane, caffeine, and ryanodine depend on different malignant hyperthermia-associated ryanodine receptor gene mutations. ||  || More than 20 mutations in the gene encoding for the ryanodine receptor (RYR1), a Ca2+ release channel of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, have been found to be associated with malignant hyperthermia (MH). This study was designed to investigate the effects of different mutations in the RYR1 gene on contracture development in in vitro contracture tests (IVCT) with halothane, caffeine, and ryanodine. Ninety-three MH-susceptible (MHS) patients, diagnosed by the standard IVCT with halothane and caffeine, were included in this prospective study. Surplus muscle specimens were used for an IVCT with 1 microm ryanodine. The contracture course during the ryanodine IVCT was described by the attainment of different time points: onset time of contracture and times when contracture reached 2 mN or 10 mN. In addition, all patients were screened for mutations of the RYR1 gene. In 36 patients, four different mutations of the RYR1 gene (C487-T, G1021-A, C1840-T, G7300-A) were found. The IVCT threshold concentrations of halothane and caffeine were lower in patients with the C487-T mutation compared with patients without a detected mutation in the RYR1 gene. In the IVCT with ryanodine, contracture levels of 2 mN and 10 mN were reached earlier in muscle specimens from patients with C487-T, C1840-T, and G7300-A mutations compared with specimens from patients with the G1021-A mutation and patients without detected mutation in the RYR1 gene. The differences between the groups in the halothane and caffeine IVCT threshold concentrations and in the time course of contracture development in the ryanodine IVCT underline the hypothesis that certain mutations in the RYR1 gene could make the ryanodine receptor more sensitive to specific ligands. This may be an explanation for varying clinical symptoms of MH crisis in humans.	4
Prediction of the responsiveness to pharmacological chaperones: lysosomal human alpha-galactosidase, a case of study. || 1-Deoxynojirimycin Catalytic Domain Fabry Disease Humans Lysosomes Models, Molecular Molecular Chaperones Mutation Predictive Value of Tests Software Structure-Activity Relationship Treatment Outcome alpha-Galactosidase || The pharmacological chaperones therapy is a promising approach to cure genetic diseases. It relies on substrate competitors used at sub-inhibitory concentration which can be administered orally, reach difficult tissues and have low cost. Clinical trials are currently carried out for Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited genetic mutations of alpha-galactosidase. Regrettably, not all genotypes respond to these drugs. We collected the experimental data available in literature on the enzymatic activity of ninety-six missense mutants of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase measured in the presence of pharmacological chaperones. We associated with each mutation seven features derived from the analysis of 3D-structure of the enzyme, two features associated with their thermo-dynamic stability and four features derived from sequence alone. Structural and thermodynamic analysis explains why some mutants of human lysosomal alpha-galactosidase cannot be rescued by pharmacological chaperones: approximately forty per cent of the non responsive cases examined can be correctly associated with a negative prognostic feature. They include mutations occurring in the active site pocket, mutations preventing disulphide bridge formation and severely destabilising mutations. Despite this finding, prediction of mutations responsive to pharmacological chaperones cannot be achieved with high accuracy relying on combinations of structure- and thermodynamic-derived features even with the aid of classical and state of the art statistical learning methods.We developed a procedure to predict responsive mutations with an accuracy as high as 87%: the method scores the mutations by using a suitable position-specific substitution matrix. Our approach is of general applicability since it does not require the knowledge of 3D-structure but relies only on the sequence. Responsiveness to pharmacological chaperones depends on the structural/functional features of the disease-associated protein, whose complex interplay is best reflected on sequence conservation by evolutionary pressure. We propose a predictive method which can be applied to screen novel mutations of alpha galactosidase. The same approach can be extended on a genomic scale to find candidates for therapy with pharmacological chaperones among proteins with unknown tertiary structures.	0
Disorders of dysregulated signal traffic through the RAS-MAPK pathway: phenotypic spectrum and molecular mechanisms. || Animals Congenital Abnormalities Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Phenotype ras Proteins || RAS GTPases control a major signaling network implicated in several cellular functions, including cell fate determination, proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, and senescence. Within this network, signal flow through the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway-the first identified mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade-mediates early and late developmental processes controlling morphology determination, organogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and growth. Signaling through the RAS-MAPK cascade is tightly controlled; and its enhanced activation represents a well-known event in oncogenesis. Unexpectedly, in the past few years, inherited dysregulation of this pathway has been recognized as the cause underlying a group of clinically related disorders sharing facial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, reduced postnatal growth, ectodermal anomalies, variable cognitive deficits, and susceptibility to certain malignancies as major features. These disorders are caused by heterozygosity for mutations in genes encoding RAS proteins, regulators of RAS function, modulators of RAS interaction with effectors, or downstream signal transducers. Here, we provide an overview of the phenotypic spectrum associated with germline mutations perturbing RAS-MAPK signaling, the unpredicted molecular mechanisms converging toward the dysregulation of this signaling cascade, and major genotype-phenotype correlations.	0
Impact of Mendelian inheritance in cardiovascular disease. || Adult Cardiovascular Diseases Child Child, Preschool Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genome, Human Humans Infant Infant, Newborn || Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. While the etiology for the majority of cardiovascular disease is presumed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors, developments in understanding the basic biology of cardiac disorders have been greatly advanced through discoveries made studying heart diseases that exhibit Mendelian forms of inheritance. Most of these diseases primarily affect children and young adults and include cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, aortic aneurysms, and congenital heart defects. The discovery of the genetic etiologies for these diseases have had significant impact on our understanding of more complex forms of cardiovascular disease and in some cases have led to novel diagnostic and treatment modalities. In this review, we will summarize these seminal genetic discoveries, highlighting a few that have resulted in significant impact on human disease, and discuss the potential utility of studying Mendelian-inherited heart disease with the development of new genetic technologies and our increased understanding of the human genome.	4
Rigid spine syndrome associated with sensory-motor axonal neuropathy resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is characteristic of Bcl-2-associated athanogene-3 gene mutations even without cardiac involvement. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Biopsy Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Electrodiagnosis Female Heart Diseases Hereditary Sensory and Motor Neuropathy Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Mallory Bodies Muscle, Skeletal Muscular Dystrophies Mutation Scoliosis Young Adult || Bcl-2-associated athanogene-3 (BAG3) mutations have been described in rare cases of rapidly progressive myofibrillar myopathies. Symptoms begin in the first decade with axial involvement and contractures and are associated with cardiac and respiratory impairment in the second decade. Axonal neuropathy has been documented but usually not as a key clinical feature. We report a 24-year-old woman with severe rigid spine syndrome and sensory-motor neuropathy resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Muscle MRI showed severe fat infiltration without any specific pattern. Deltoid muscle biopsy showed neurogenic changes and discrete myofibrillar abnormalities. Electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiography results were normal. Genetic analysis of a panel of 45 CMT genes showed no mutation. BAG3 gene screening identified the previously reported c.626C>T, pPro209Leu, mutation. This case indicates that rigid spine syndrome and sensory-motor axonal neuropathy are key clinical features of BAG3 mutations that should be considered even without cardiac involvement.

Assessing the clinical value of targeted massively parallel sequencing in a longitudinal, prospective population-based study of cancer patients. || DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Neoplasms Prospective Studies || Recent discoveries in cancer research have revealed a plethora of clinically actionable mutations that provide therapeutic, prognostic and predictive benefit to patients. The feasibility of screening mutations as part of the routine clinical care of patients remains relatively unexplored as the demonstration of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of tumours in the general population is required to assess its value towards the health-care system. Cancer 2015 study is a large-scale, prospective, multisite cohort of newly diagnosed cancer patients from Victoria, Australia with 1094 patients recruited. MPS was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel. Overall, 854 patients were successfully sequenced for 48 common cancer genes. Accurate determination of clinically relevant mutations was possible including in less characterised cancer types; however, technical limitations including formalin-induced sequencing artefacts were uncovered. Applying strict filtering criteria, clinically relevant mutations were identified in 63% of patients, with 26% of patients displaying a mutation with therapeutic implications. A subset of patients was validated for canonical mutations using the Agena Bioscience MassARRAY system with 100% concordance. Whereas the prevalence of mutations was consistent with other institutionally based series for some tumour streams (breast carcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma), others were different (lung adenocarcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma), which has significant implications for health economic modelling of particular targeted agents. Actionable mutations in tumours not usually thought to harbour such genetic changes were also identified. Reliable delivery of a diagnostic assay able to screen for a range of actionable mutations in this cohort was achieved, opening unexpected avenues for investigation and treatment of cancer patients.	4
Molecular-genetic causes for the high frequency of phenylketonuria in the population from the North Caucasus. || Gene Frequency Haplotypes Humans Infant, Newborn Linkage Disequilibrium Pedigree Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Russia || Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene PAH. Different PAH pathogenic variants occur in different ethnic groups with various frequencies and the incidence of the disease itself varies from country to country. In the Caucasus region of Russia, some ethnoses are geographically and culturally isolated from each other. The tradition of monoethnic marriages may cause decreased genetic variability in those populations. In the Karachay-Cherkess Republic (Russia), the highest incidence of phenylketonuria in the world has been detected (1:850 newborns) in the region and 1:332 among the titular nation Karachays. Here, we showed that this phenomenon is due to the widespread prevalence of the p.Arg261* variant. Its allele frequency among Karachay patients with PKU was 68.4% and the carrier frequency in Karachays was 1:16 healthy individuals. PAH haplotype analysis showed a unique common origin. The founder haplotype and mutation "age" were estimated by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium between p.Arg261* and extragenic short tandem repeat loci. The p.Arg261* variant occurred in the Karachays population 10.2 ± 2.7 generations ago (275 ± 73 years) and its spread occurred in parallel with the growth of the population.	3
Cancer spectrum and frequency among children with Noonan, Costello, and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Costello Syndrome Ectodermal Dysplasia Facies Failure to Thrive Female Germ-Line Mutation Germany Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Infant Male Neoplasms Noonan Syndrome Registries Risk Factors Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Somatic mutations affecting components of the Ras-MAPK pathway are a common feature of cancer, whereas germline Ras pathway mutations cause developmental disorders including Noonan, Costello, and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes. These 'RASopathies' also represent cancer-prone syndromes, but the quantitative cancer risks remain unknown. We investigated the occurrence of childhood cancer including benign and malignant tumours of the central nervous system in a group of 735 individuals with germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes by matching their information with the German Childhood Cancer Registry. We observed 12 cases of cancer in the entire RASopathy cohort vs 1.12 expected (based on German population-based incidence rates). This corresponds to a 10.5-fold increased risk of all childhood cancers combined (standardised incidence ratio (SIR)=10.5, 95% confidence interval=5.4-18.3). The specific cancers included juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia=4; brain tumour=3; acute lymphoblastic leukaemia=2; rhabdomyosarcoma=2; and neuroblastoma=1. The childhood cancer SIR in Noonan syndrome patients was 8.1, whereas that for Costello syndrome patients was 42.4. These data comprise the first quantitative evidence documenting that the germline mutations in Ras signalling pathway genes are associated with increased risks of both childhood leukaemia and solid tumours.	4
A unique point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) causes non-syndromic craniosynostosis. ||  || A unique Pro250Arg mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) was recently found in patients with non-syndromic craniosynostosis. We studied 18 Taiwan Chinese patients with various types of craniosynostosis to evaluate if this mutation is also prevalent in the Chinese population. Genomic DNA was analysed by polymerase chain reaction based restriction analysis and direct sequencing to identify the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3. Five (28%) of 18 probands were heterozygous for the Pro250Arg mutation. Only those patients with coronal synostosis carried this mutation. Our findings suggest that all patients with coronal synostosis should be examined for this unique mutation.	4
Genotype-phenotype comparison of the Swiss malignant hyperthermia population. ||  || Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially lethal pharmacogenetic disease, triggered by inhalative anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants in genetically predisposed individuals. Linkage analysis have revealed MH to be a heterogenetic disease with about 50% of MH families linked to the locus of the ryanodine receptor calcium channel (RYR1). We investigated the frequency of the 23 published MH linked RYR1 gene mutations in the Swiss MH population and compared our findings to the results of the in vitro contracture test (IVCT). IVCT was performed following the protocol of the European MH Group and mutation screening was done by PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction enzyme digestion or SSCP. We identified RYR1 gene mutations in 40% of unrelated MH families (19/48) with a high incidence of the mutation V2168M (27%). IVCT results revealed a significantly stronger functional effect of mutations R614C and V2168M as compared to mutations G2434R and R2458C. This is the first time that such a high incidence of RYR1 gene mutations in an MH population has been found, supporting the use of molecular genetic testing for the diagnosis of MH susceptibility in suitable families. In addition our data show that different RYR1 gene mutations are associated with different IVCT phenotypes.	4
Mutational analysis for GJB2, GJB6, and GJB3 genes in Campania within a universal neonatal hearing screening programme. || Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Association Studies Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Incidence Infant Italy Mass Screening Sequence Deletion || To determine the incidence of GJB2 and GJB3 mutations and of two deletions upstream of the GJB6 gene in infants of the Campania region of southern Italy. DNA samples from non-syndromic hearing-impaired infants enrolled in a neonatal screening programme for sensorineural hearing loss were analysed by PCR and by direct sequencing. The audiological features of infants with biallelic GJB2 mutations were also examined to identify genotype-phenotype correlations. Molecular analyses were carried out in 129 affected and five unaffected infants. A genetic etiology of hearing loss was identified in 28% of infants, including several at environmental risk of hearing loss. Neither GJB6 nor GJB3 (a gene not previously investigated in the Campania population) mutations were found. This study confirms the importance of universal neonatal hearing screening. The identification of a genetic cause in infants at environmental risk indicates that such infants should be included when investigating etiology. We confirm that also in our geographical area, c.35delG homozygotes tend to have severe symmetrical hearing loss, whereas hearing impairment is milder in compound heterozygotes.	4
Aggressive natural killer-cell leukemia mutational landscape and drug profiling highlight JAK-STAT signaling as therapeutic target. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child DEAD-box RNA Helicases Female Humans Janus Kinases Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic Male Middle Aged Mutation STAT3 Transcription Factor Signal Transduction Whole Exome Sequencing Young Adult || Aggressive natural killer-cell (NK-cell) leukemia (ANKL) is an extremely aggressive malignancy with dismal prognosis and lack of targeted therapies. Here, we elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of ANKL using a combination of genomic and drug sensitivity profiling. We study 14 ANKL patients using whole-exome sequencing (WES) and identify mutations in STAT3 (21%) and RAS-MAPK pathway genes (21%) as well as in DDX3X (29%) and epigenetic modifiers (50%). Additional alterations include JAK-STAT copy gains and tyrosine phosphatase mutations, which we show recurrent also in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL) through integration of public genomic data. Drug sensitivity profiling further demonstrates the role of the JAK-STAT pathway in the pathogenesis of NK-cell malignancies, identifying NK cells to be highly sensitive to JAK and BCL2 inhibition compared to other hematopoietic cell lineages. Our results provide insight into ANKL genetics and a framework for application of targeted therapies in NK-cell malignancies.	4
Dishevelled has a YAP nuclear export function in a tumor suppressor context-dependent manner. || A549 Cells AMP-Activated Protein Kinases Active Transport, Cell Nucleus Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Animals Cadherins Cell Nucleus Cytoplasm DNA Mutational Analysis Dishevelled Proteins Female Genes, Tumor Suppressor HCT116 Cells HEK293 Cells Humans MCF-7 Cells Mice Mice, Nude Mutation Phosphoproteins Phosphorylation Protein Transport Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Wnt Proteins Wnt1 Protein alpha Catenin || Phosphorylation-dependent YAP translocation is a well-known intracellular mechanism of the Hippo pathway; however, the molecular effectors governing YAP cytoplasmic translocation remains undefined. Recent findings indicate that oncogenic YAP paradoxically suppresses Wnt activity. Here, we show that Wnt scaffolding protein Dishevelled (DVL) is responsible for cytosolic translocation of phosphorylated YAP. Mutational inactivation of the nuclear export signal embedded in DVL leads to nuclear YAP retention, with an increase in TEAD transcriptional activity. DVL is also required for YAP subcellular localization induced by E-cadherin, α-catenin, or AMPK activation. Importantly, the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking is dependent on the p53-Lats2 or LKB1-AMPK tumor suppressor axes, which determine YAP phosphorylation status. In vivo and clinical data support that the loss of p53 or LKB1 relieves DVL-linked reciprocal inhibition between the Wnt and nuclear YAP activity. Our observations provide mechanistic insights into controlled proliferation coupled with epithelial polarity during development and human cancer.	0
Genome-editing applications of CRISPR-Cas9 to promote in vitro studies of Alzheimer's disease. || Alzheimer Disease Animals CRISPR-Associated Proteins Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats Disease Models, Animal Gene Editing Humans Mutation || Genetic variations play an important role in the clinical presentation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Hundreds of mutations have been reported with the majority resulting from alterations in β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes. The roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of AD have been classically confirmed or refuted through functional studies, where the mutations are cloned, inserted into cell lines, and monitored for changes in various properties including cell survival, amyloid production, or Aβ42/40 ratio. However, these verification studies tend to be expensive, time consuming, and inconsistent. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system was developed, which improves sequence-specific gene editing in cell lines, organs, and animals. CRISPR-Cas9 is a promising tool for the generation of models of human genetic diseases and could facilitate the establishment of new animal AD models and the observation of dynamic bioprocesses in AD. Here, we recapitulated the history of CRISPR technology, recent progress, and, especially, its potential applications in AD-related genetic, animal modeling, and functional studies.	0
A bead-based multiplexed immunoassay to evaluate breast cancer biomarkers for early detection in pre-diagnostic serum. || Aged Antigens, Neoplasm Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Carcinoembryonic Antigen Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies Demography Female Fetal Proteins Haptoglobins Humans Immunoassay Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Osteopontin Principal Component Analysis Prolactin Prospective Studies || This study investigates whether a set of ten potential breast cancer serum biomarkers and cancer antigens (osteopontin (OPN), haptoglobin, cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), prolactin, cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), α-fetoprotein (AFP), leptin and migration inhibitory factor (MIF)) can predict early stage breast cancer in samples collected before clinical diagnosis (phase III samples). We performed a nested case-control study within the Prospect-EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition) cohort. We examined to what extent the biomarker panel could discriminate between 68 women diagnosed with breast cancer up to three years after enrollment and 68 matched healthy controls (all 56-64 years at baseline). Using a quantitative bead-based multiplexed assay, we determined protein concentrations in serum samples collected at enrollment. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forest (RF) analysis revealed that on the basis of all ten proteins, early cases could not be separated from controls. When we combined serum protein concentrations and subject characteristics related to breast cancer risk in the RF analysis, this did not result in classification accuracy scores that could correctly classify the samples (sensitivity: 50%, specificity: 50%). Our findings indicate that this panel of selected tumor markers cannot be used for diagnosis of early breast cancer.	4
Mutation screening of phenylketonuria in the Far East of Russia. || Child Child, Preschool Genetic Testing Humans Infant Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Russia || We analyzed mutant genotypes at the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus among phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in the Far East of Russia. A total of 60 variant alleles from 30 PKU families were analyzed for prevalent Caucasian mutations and restriction fragment length polymorphism/variable number of tandem repeats (RFLP/VNTR) haplotypes. Seventy-eight percent of all variant alleles carried six mutations. The most prevalent mutation was R408W (63%), with a haplotype background of 2.3. It also showed a very high degree of homozygosity (43%). The other five mutations (R158Q, R261Q, R252W, R261X, and IVS12nt-1) accounted for 1.7%-6.7% of all PKU alleles, and a single haplotype was associated with each genotype, except for R261Q. The genetic structure of PKU patients in the Far East of Russia seems to be relatively homogeneous, compared with that in the other Slavic and Oriental populations of surrounding countries. Prediction of a clinical phenotype and carrier detection will be feasible using DNA tests.	1 3

We carried out a systematic mutational screening of GJB2 gene in these subjects by amplifying the coding region of GJB2 gene and sequencing directly.<b>Result:</b>Thirty kinds of mutation were identified, including eleven pathogenic mutations, one hypomorphic allele, sixteen polymorphic mutations and two novel mutations. The c.235delC mutation was the most prevalent pathogenic mutation in this cohort (18.50%), and the rate of allele mutation was 12.16%. The frequency of c.299_300delAT,c.176_191del16,c.512_513insAACG,c.35delG,c.283G>A,c.427C>T,c.35insG,c.439G>A,c.571T>C,c.139G>T mutations were decreased in turn.<b>Conclusion:</b>c.235delC mutation is the hot spot of GJB2 gene mutation in NSHL patients in Zhejiang province and the most common mutational pattern is frame-shift mutation. The discovery of novel mutations enriches the spectrum and frequency of variants in GJB2 gene.	4
A-kinase anchoring proteins: from protein complexes to physiology and disease. || A Kinase Anchor Proteins Animals Cyclic AMP Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases Female Male Melanosomes Models, Genetic Multiprotein Complexes Myocardium Oocytes Signal Transduction Spermatozoa || Protein scaffold complexes are a key mechanism by which a common signaling pathway can serve many different functions. Sequestering a signaling enzyme to a specific subcellular environment not only ensures that the enzyme is near its relevant targets, but also segregates this activity to prevent indiscriminate phosphorylation of other substrates. One family of diverse, well-studied scaffolding proteins are the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). These anchoring proteins form multi-protein complexes that integrate cAMP signaling with other pathways and signaling events. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the elucidation of AKAP function.	0
Allele-specific silencing of mutant p53 attenuates dominant-negative and gain-of-function activities. || Alleles Animals Apoptosis Blotting, Western Carcinogenesis Cell Adhesion Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Down-Regulation Genes, Dominant Humans Imidazoles Immunoenzyme Techniques Mice Mutant Proteins Mutation Neoplasms Piperazines RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Many p53 hotspot mutants not only lose the transcriptional activity, but also show dominant-negative (DN) and oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) activities. Increasing evidence indicates that knockdown of mutant p53 (mutp53) in cancer cells reduces their aggressive properties, suggesting that survival and proliferation of cancer cells are, at least partially, dependent on the presence of mutp53. However, these p53 siRNAs can downregulate both wild-type p53 (wtp53) and mutp53, which limits their therapeutic applications. In order to specifically deplete mutp53, we have developed allele-specific siRNAs against p53 hotspot mutants and validated their biological effects in the absence or presence of wtp53. First, the mutp53-specific siRNAs selectively reduced protein levels of matched p53 mutants with minimal reduction in wtp53 levels. Second, downregulation of mutp53 in cancer cells expressing a mutp53 alone (p53mut) resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation and migration. Third, transfection of mutp53-specific siRNAs in cancer cells expressing both wtp53 and mutp53 also reduced cell proliferation and migration with increased transcripts of p53 downstream target genes, which became further profound when cells were treated with an MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a or a chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. These results indicate that depletion of mutp53 by its specific siRNA restored endogenous wtp53 activity in cells expressing both wtp53 and mutp53. This is the first study demonstrating biological effects and therapeutic potential of allele-specific silencing of mutp53 by mutp53-specific siRNAs in cancer cells expressing both wtp53 and mutp53, thus providing a novel strategy towards targeted cancer therapies.	0
The role of p53 in cancer drug resistance and targeted chemotherapy. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Enzyme Inhibitors Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Protein Conformation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Structure-Activity Relationship Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cancer has long been a grievous disease complicated by innumerable players aggravating its cure. Many clinical studies demonstrated the prognostic relevance of the tumor suppressor protein p53 for many human tumor types. Overexpression of mutated p53 with reduced or abolished function is often connected to resistance to standard medications, including cisplatin, alkylating agents (temozolomide), anthracyclines, (doxorubicin), antimetabolites (gemcitabine), antiestrogenes (tamoxifen) and EGFR-inhibitors (cetuximab). Such mutations in the TP53 gene are often accompanied by changes in the conformation of the p53 protein. Small molecules that restore the wild-type conformation of p53 and, consequently, rebuild its proper function have been identified. These promising agents include PRIMA-1, MIRA-1, and several derivatives of the thiosemicarbazone family. In addition to mutations in p53 itself, p53 activity may be also be impaired due to alterations in p53's regulating proteins such as MDM2. MDM2 functions as primary cellular p53 inhibitor and deregulation of the MDM2/p53-balance has serious consequences. MDM2 alterations often result in its overexpression and therefore promote inhibition of p53 activity. To deal with this problem, a judicious approach is to employ MDM2 inhibitors. Several promising MDM2 inhibitors have been described such as nutlins, benzodiazepinediones or spiro-oxindoles as well as novel compound classes such as xanthone derivatives and trisubstituted aminothiophenes. Furthermore, even naturally derived inhibitor compounds such as α-mangostin, gambogic acid and siladenoserinols have been discovered. In this review, we discuss in detail such small molecules that play a pertinent role in affecting the p53-MDM2 signaling axis and analyze their potential as cancer chemotherapeutics.	0
[p53 gene mutations of familial breast cancer and early-onset breast cancer in part population of southern China]. ||  || To investigate the site and characteristic of p53 gene mutations in familial or early-onset breast cancer patients in part population of southern China. Methods: A total of 150 patients with familial and early-onset breast cancer in parts population of southern China were enrolled. Genomic DNA was isolated from each peripheral blood sample, and the entire coding sequence and exon and intron splicing region of p53 gene were amplificated by PCR in the 150 patients. The mutation analysis were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Results: In the 150 patients with familial and early-onset breast cancer, 6 mutations including one novel pathogenic mutation 869_888 ins20 (insert mutation) and 5 previously reported pathogenic mutations (deletion mutation 643_660del18 and 4 missense mutation 91G>A, 215C>G, 537T>G, 743G>A) were identified in p53 gene encoding region in 9 patients of breast cancer. Moreover, one same sense mutation 141G>A in exon 4, one 16 bases deletion in intron 3, and 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms in p53 gene introns were also identified. The total mutation frequency of p53 gene in 150 patients with familial breast cancer and early-onset breast cancer from part population of southern China was 6.00%, and the mutation frequency of familial breast cancer and early-onset breast cancer was 6.81% and 6.25%, respectively. Conclusion: The total mutation frequency of p53 gene in 150 patients with familial breast cancer and early-onset breast cancer from partpopulation of southern China is higher than the frequency previously reported. The pathogenicity of the novel mutations (insert mutation) 869_888ins20 will be confirmed by function analysis in the future study. The deletion mutation 643_660del18 enriches the p53 gene mutation database among Chinese population, which is probably the specific mutation of breast cancer in Chinese population.	4
Whole genome sequencing identifies a novel ALMS1 gene mutation in two Chinese siblings with Alström syndrome. || Adolescent Alstrom Syndrome Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Genome, Human Humans Male Mutation Proteins Sequence Analysis, DNA Siblings || Alström syndrome is a rare multi-systemic disorder with a broad spectrum of symptoms. This syndrome is characterized by childhood retinal degeneration; sensorineural hearing loss; obesity; type 2 diabetes mellitus; cardiomyopathy; systemic fibrosis; and pulmonary, hepatic, and renal failure. A Chinese quartet family with two siblings predominantly affected by cone-rod dystrophy and short stature were recruited. The craniofacial dysmorphism and on-set age-of-cone-rod dystrophy in the proband showed a minor intrafamilial variability. Whole genome sequencing was performed to provide the full spectrum of the two siblings' genetic variations. In this study, we present the patients' clinical features and our interpretation of the whole genome sequencing data. After examining the data, we focus on two compound heterozygous mutations, (c.3902C > A, p.S1301X; c.6436C > T, p.R2146X) in ALMS1, which are shared by two siblings. We reported a novel ALMS1 mutation. Whole genome sequencing is a powerful tool to provide the full spectrum of genetic variations for heterogeneous disorders such as Alström syndrome.	4
Two-tier approach for the detection of alpha-galactosidase A deficiency in a predominantly female haemodialysis population. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Fabry Disease Female Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Renal Dialysis Sex Factors || Fabry's disease (AFD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease, resulting from a deficiency in alpha-galactosidase A (AGALA). Untreated, this leads to precocious failure of vital organ function and death. As enzyme replacement therapy is available, it is of vital importance that affected individuals can be traced. We set up a screening in the Flemish haemodialysis population using a two-tier approach. The first tier was a determination of alpha-galactosidase A activity using a dried blood spot on filter paper, in the second tier, patients with the lowest alpha-galactosidase levels were further subjected to mutation analysis of the GLA gene. 1284 patients (1047 women, 237 men) were evaluated for inclusion, eliminating patients with definite renal diagnoses. Total 922 patients (71.8 %) were screened (742 women, 180 men). Fifty seven patients were subjected to further genetic analysis. Three GLA mutation carriers were identified: two apparently nonrelated female patients carry the missense mutation p.Ala143Thr (c.427G > A), a missense mutation p.Trp236Arg (c.706T > C) was identified in a man. While the male patient had been clinically diagnosed with AFD, the female patients had remained unrecognized. Additional family based screening resulted in the identification of nine mutation carriers (four males and five females). We demonstrated that the prevalence of GLA mutation carriers in our haemodialysis population is 0.3%. Our results show that the proposed approach accurately detects AFD patients. We conclude that screening for AFD in high risk populations is a cost-effective, technically feasible and clinically valuable objective.	3
Polymorphisms at LDLR locus may be associated with coronary artery disease through modulation of coagulation factor VIII activity and independently from lipid profile. || Coronary Artery Disease DNA Helicases Factor VIII Female Genotype Haplotypes Humans Lipids Male Middle Aged Nuclear Proteins Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Prognosis Receptors, LDL Risk Factors Transcription Factors || High levels of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) have been associated with cardiovascular disease. Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has been recently demonstrated to contribute to FVIII clearance from plasma. The aim of this study was to evaluate 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms in SMARCA4-LDLR gene locus (rs1122608, rs2228671, and rs688) and FVIII coagulant activity (FVIII:c) in subjects with (n = 692) or without (n = 291) angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (CAD). High FVIII:c levels were an independent risk factor for CAD. The rs688 and rs2228671 genotypes were predictors of FVIII:c with T alleles associated with higher FVIII:c levels. The rs2228671T allele was associated also with reduced total and LDL-cholesterol levels. With respect to the risk of CAD, no association was found for rs2228671. Consistently with higher FVIII:c levels, the rs688T allele was associated with CAD, whereas, consistently with a favorable lipid profile, the rs1122608T allele was associated with a decreased CAD prevalence. After adjustment for classic cardiovascular risk factors, including plasma lipids, rs688 remained associated with CAD (OR for T carriers: 1.67 with 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.54). Haplotype analysis confirmed such results. Our data suggest that polymorphisms at LDLR locus modulate FVIII:c levels and may be associated with CAD risk independently from plasma lipids.	4
Resveratrol prevents p53 aggregation in vitro and in breast cancer cells. ||  || One potential target for cancer therapeutics is the tumor suppressor p53, which is mutated in more than 50% of malignant tumors. Loss of function (LoF), dominant negative (DN) and gain of function (GoF) mutations in p53 are associated with amyloid aggregation. We tested the potential of resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol, to interact and prevent the aggregation of wild-type and mutant p53 in vitro using fluorescence spectroscopy techniques and in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, HCC-70 and MCF-7) using immunofluorescence co-localization assays. Based on our data, an interaction occurs between resveratrol and the wild-type p53 core domain (p53C). In addition, resveratrol and its derivatives pterostilbene and piceatannol inhibit mutant p53C aggregationin vitro. Additionally, resveratrol reduces mutant p53 protein aggregation in MDA-MB-231 and HCC-70 cells but not in the wild-type p53 cell line MCF-7. To verify the effects of resveratrol on tumorigenicity, cell proliferation and cell migration assays were performed using MDA-MB-231 cells. Resveratrol significantly reduced the proliferative and migratory capabilities of these cells. Our study provides evidence that resveratrol directly modulates p53, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms involved in p53 aggregation and its potential as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.	0
TP53 gene mutation analysis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia by nanopore MinION sequencing. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Cost-Benefit Analysis DNA Mutational Analysis Female Health Care Costs High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Predictive Value of Tests Reproducibility of Results Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The assessment of TP53 mutational status is becoming a routine clinical practice for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (CLL). A broad spectrum of molecular techniques has been employed so far, including both direct Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies recently released the MinION an USB-interfaced sequencer. In this paper we report our experience, with the MinION technology for the detection of the TP53 gene mutation in CLL patients. Twelve CLL patients at diagnosis were included in this study. All except one patient showed the TP53 gene deletion in Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments. Patients were investigated for TP53 mutation by Sanger and by MinION sequencing. Analysis by Sanger was performed according with the IARC protocol. Analysis by MinION was performed adopting a strategy based on long template PCR, read error correction, and post variant calling filtering. Due to the high error rate of nanopore technology, sequence data were both used directly and before correction with two different in silico methods: ALEC and nanocorrect. A mean error rate of 15 % was detected before correction that was reduced to 4-5 % after correction. Analysis by Sanger sequencing was able to detect four patients mutated for TP53. MinION analysis detected one more mutated patient previously not detected from Sanger. In our hands, the Nanopore technology shows correlation with Sanger sequencing but more sensitive, manageable and less expensive, and therefore has proven to be a useful tool for TP53 gene mutation detection.	4
Patient-derived iPSCs show premature neural differentiation and neuron type-specific phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopment. ||  || Ras/MAPK pathway signaling is a major participant in neurodevelopment, and evidence suggests that BRAF, a key Ras signal mediator, influences human behavior. We studied the role of the mutation BRAFQ257R, the most common cause of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC), in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived model of human neurodevelopment. In iPSC-derived neuronal cultures from CFC subjects, we observed decreased p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 compared to controls, as well as a depleted neural progenitor pool and rapid neuronal maturation. Pharmacological PI3K/AKT pathway manipulation recapitulated cellular phenotypes in control cells and attenuated them in CFC cells. CFC cultures displayed altered cellular subtype ratios and increased intrinsic excitability. Moreover, in CFC cells, Ras/MAPK pathway activation and morphological abnormalities exhibited cell subtype-specific differences. Our results highlight the importance of exploring specific cellular subtypes and of using iPSC models to reveal relevant human-specific neurodevelopmental events.	0
Haplotype distribution at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in PKU families from the Moravian area of Czechoslovakia. ||  || The analysis of 21 families affected with classical phenylketonuria (PKU) from the Moravian area of Czechoslovakia has revealed 12 different RFLP haplotypes. Nine and eight haplotypes were associated with the normal and with the mutant alleles, respectively. Most normal alleles are associated with haplotype 1 (42.9%). Almost 80% of all mutant alleles are confined within only three haplotypes (1, 2 and 4). There was a strong association between haplotype 2 and the Czech mutant alleles (61.9% of the mutant alleles compared with 4.8% of the normal alleles). There was linkage disequilibrium between this haplotype and the R408W mutation in exon 12. Two mutant haplotypes 7 were found and in both cases they were tightly linked with G272ter mutation. Our finding is in agreement with observations in other Eastern European countries. These data provide further support for the theories of the spread of the R408W mutation from east to west in European populations.	3
Chronic inflammation and cancer: potential chemoprevention through nuclear factor kappa B and p53 mutual antagonism. ||  || Activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- κB) as a mechanism of host defense against infection and stress is the central mediator of inflammatory responses. A normal (acute) inflammatory response is activated on urgent basis and is auto-regulated. Chronic inflammation that results due to failure in the regulatory mechanism, however, is largely considered as a critical determinant in the initiation and progression of various forms of cancer. Mechanistically, NF- κB favors this process by inducing various genes responsible for cell survival, proliferation, migration, invasion while at the same time antagonizing growth regulators including tumor suppressor p53. It has been shown by various independent investigations that a down regulation of NF- κB activity directly, or indirectly through the activation of the p53 pathway reduces tumor growth substantially. Therefore, there is a huge effort driven by many laboratories to understand the NF- κB signaling pathways to intervene the function of this crucial player in inflammation and tumorigenesis in order to find an effective inhibitor directly, or through the p53 tumor suppressor. We discuss here on the role of NF- κB in chronic inflammation and cancer, highlighting mutual antagonism between NF- κB and p53 pathways in the process. We also discuss prospective pharmacological modulators of these two pathways, including those that were already tested to affect this mutual antagonism.	0
Investigating Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in a Liver-on-a-Chip Microfluidic Device. || Cell Culture Techniques Cell Survival Cellular Microenvironment Fatty Acids, Nonesterified Hep G2 Cells Humans Lab-On-A-Chip Devices Lipid Metabolism Liver Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Oxidative Stress Risk Factors || Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which may progress to cirrhosis, eventually leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC ranks as the third highest cause of cancer-related death globally, requiring an early diagnosis of NAFLD as a potential risk factor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD are still under investigation. So far, many in vitro studies on NAFLD have been hampered by the limitations of 2D culture systems, in which cells rapidly lose tissue-specific functions. The present liver-on-a-chip approach aims at filling the gap between conventional in vitro models, often scarcely predictive of in vivo conditions, and animal models, potentially biased by their xenogeneic nature. HepG2 cells were cultured into a microfluidically perfused device under free fatty acid (FFA) supplementation, namely palmitic and oleic acid, for 24h and 48h. The device mimicked the endothelial-parenchymal interface of a liver sinusoid, allowing the diffusion of nutrients and removal of waste products similar to the hepatic microvasculature. Assessment of intracellular lipid accumulation, cell viability/cytotoxicity and oxidative stress due to the FFA overload, was performed by high-content analysis methodologies using fluorescence-based functional probes. The chip enables gradual and lower intracellular lipid accumulation, higher hepatic cell viability and minimal oxidative stress in microfluidic dynamic vs. 2D static cultures, thus mimicking the chronic condition of steatosis observed in vivo more closely. Overall, the liver-on-a-chip system provides a suitable culture microenvironment, representing a more reliable model compared to 2D cultures for investigating NAFLD pathogenesis. Hence, our system is amongst the first in vitro models of human NAFLD developed within a microfluidic device in a sinusoid-like fashion, endowing a more permissive tissue-like microenvironment for long-term culture of hepatic cells than conventional 2D static cultures.	0
Suppression of iASPP-dependent aggressiveness in cervical cancer through reversal of methylation silencing of microRNA-124. || Base Sequence Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cytidine DNA Methylation Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Silencing Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins MicroRNAs Models, Biological Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplastic Stem Cells Oncogenes Phenotype Protein Binding Repressor Proteins Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Uterine Cervical Neoplasms || Derepression of wild-type p53 by suppressing its negative inhibitor iASPP (Inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53) represents a potential therapeutic option for cervical cancer (CC). Here, we reported a novel functional significance of iASPP upregulation in cervical tumorigenesis: iASPP acts as a key promoter of CC cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and cancer stemness, by interacting with p53 to suppress p53-mediated transcription of target genes and reducing p53-responsive microRNA-34a levels. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-124, directly targeting iASPP, reduces expression of iASPP and attenuates CC cell growth and invasiveness. Low miR-124 expression is inversely correlated with increased expression of iASPP mRNA in CC tissues. In a cohort of 40 patients with CC, the low miR-124 expression was correlated with poor 5-year overall survival (P = 0.0002) and shorter disease-free survival 5-year (P = 0006). Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor Zebularine increases miR-124 expression and retards CC cell growth and invasion with minimal toxicity to normal cells. Even at a non-toxic concentration, Zebularine was effective in suppressing CC cell invasion and migration. Altogether, the restoration of miR-124 reduces iASPP expression and leads to p53-dependent tumor suppression, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to treat iASPP-associated CC.	0
Blocking downstream signaling pathways in the context of HDAC inhibition promotes apoptosis preferentially in cells harboring mutant Ras. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Depsipeptides Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Genes, ras Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Humans Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction || We previously demonstrated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in a series of romidepsin-selected T-cell lymphoma cell lines as a mechanism of resistance to the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI), romidepsin. As Ras mutation leads to activation of both the MAPK and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, we examined whether combining romidepsin with small molecule pathway inhibitors would lead to increased apoptosis in cancers harboring Ras mutations. We treated 18 Ras mutant or wild-type cell lines with romidepsin in the presence of a MEK inhibitor (PD-0325901) and/or an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206) and examined apoptosis by flow cytometry. A short-term treatment schedule of romidepsin (25 ng/ml for 6 h) was used to more closely model clinical administration. Romidepsin in combination with a MEK and an AKT inhibitor induced apoptosis preferentially in cells harboring mutant versus wild-type Ras (69.1% vs. 21.1%, p < 0.0001). Similar results were found in a subset of cell lines when belinostat was combined with the MEK and AKT inhibitors and when romidepsin was combined with the dual extracellular signaling-related kinase (ERK)/PI3K inhibitor, D-87503, which inhibited both the MAPK and PI3K pathways at 5-10 μM. The observed apoptosis was caspase-dependent and required Bak and Bax expression. Cells with wild-type or mutant Ras treated with romidepsin alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor displayed increased expression of proapoptotic Bim. We thus conclude that cancers bearing Ras mutations, such as pancreatic cancer, can be targeted by the combination of an HDI and a dual inhibitor of the MAPK and PI3K pathways.	0
Blockage of intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels inhibit human pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro. || Cell Count Cell Division Gene Expression Humans Pancreatic Neoplasms Potassium Channel Blockers Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Cells, Cultured Up-Regulation || Ion channels are important in controlling cell cycle progression and proliferation in a variety of cell types. Using the whole-cell recording mode of the patch-clamp technique, functional ion channels were electrophysiologically characterized in PANC-1 (K-ras G12D (+/-), p53 R273C, Deltap16), BxPC-3 (smad4-, p53 Y220C, Deltap16), and MiaPaCa-2 [transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II defect, K-ras G12C(-/-), p53 R248W, Deltap16] human pancreatic cancer cell lines. In BxPC-3 and the MiaPaCa-2 cells, we could identify approximately 600 or approximately 1200 functional Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IK) per cell, respectively, whereas PANC-1 cells expressed approximately 200 functional IK channels per cell. These channels were observed by using pipette solutions buffering [Ca2+]i to 1 microM. The channels were voltage-independent, blocked by charybdotoxin, clotrimazole, 1-[(2-chlorophenyl) diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole (TRAM-34), and blocked by Ba2+ in a voltage-dependent manner. In the presence of 10 microM clotrimazole or TRAM-34, proliferation of the BxPC-3 as well as the MiaPaCa-2 cells was completely stopped. In contrast, proliferation of PANC-1 cells was hardly affected by clotrimazole or TRAM-34. Proliferation in all three cell lines could be inhibited in the presence of the Ca2+ channel antagonists verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. By quantitative RT-PCR, we could show that MiaPaCa-2 cells exhibit a 2.8-fold and BxPC3 cells a more than 8-fold elevated level of IK mRNA level compared with PANC-1 cells. Interestingly, in primary pancreatic tumors we found a tremendous up-regulation of IK mRNA. In eight of nine (or 89%) primary pancreatic tumor tissues, we found a 6- to 66-fold increase in IK mRNA. Our findings suggest that a certain amount of functional IK channels is crucial for the proliferation of some pancreatic cancer types. The blockade of IK channels may ultimately prove useful as a therapeutic option for some patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with an up-regulated IK channel expression.	0
Spectrum of HNF1A somatic mutations in hepatocellular adenoma differs from that in patients with MODY3 and suggests genotoxic damage. || Adenoma, Liver Cell Adolescent Adult Aged DNA Damage Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Female Gene Frequency Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Humans Immunohistochemistry Liver Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Oxidative Stress Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction || Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3) is a consequence of heterozygous germline mutation in HNF1A. A subtype of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is also caused by biallelic somatic HNF1A mutations (H-HCA), and rare HCA may be related to MODY3. To better understand a relationship between the development of MODY3 and HCA, we compared both germline and somatic spectra of HNF1A mutations. We compared 151 somatic HNF1A mutations in HCA with 364 germline mutations described in MODY3. We searched for genotoxic and oxidative stress features in HCA and surrounding liver tissue. A spectrum of HNF1A somatic mutations significantly differed from the germline changes in MODY3. In HCA, we identified a specific hot spot at codon 206, nonsense and frameshift mutations mainly in the NH(2)-terminal part, and almost all amino acid substitutions were restricted to the POU-H domain. The high frequency of G-to-T tranversions, predominantly found on the nontranscribed DNA strand, suggested a genotoxic mechanism. However, no features of oxidative stress were observed in the nontumor liver tissue. Finally, in a few MODY3 patients with HNF1A germline mutation leading to amino acid substitutions outside the POU-H domain, we identified a different subtype of HCA either with a gp130 and/or CTNNB1 activating mutation. Germline HNF1A mutations could be associated with different molecular subtypes of HCA. H-HCA showed mutations profoundly inactivating hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha function; they are associated with a genotoxic signature suggesting a specific toxicant exposure that could be associated with genetic predisposition.	4
TumorNext: A comprehensive tumor profiling assay that incorporates high resolution copy number analysis and germline status to improve testing accuracy. || Computational Biology DNA Copy Number Variations DNA Mutational Analysis Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Neoplasms Paraffin Embedding Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Reproducibility of Results Tissue Fixation || The development of targeted therapies for both germline and somatic DNA mutations has increased the need for molecular profiling assays to determine the mutational status of specific genes. Moreover, the potential of off-label prescription of targeted therapies favors classifying tumors based on DNA alterations rather than traditional tissue pathology. Here we describe the analytical validation of a custom probe-based NGS tumor panel, TumorNext, which can detect single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions in 142 genes that are frequently mutated in somatic and/or germline cancers. TumorNext also detects gene fusions and structural variants, such as tandem duplications and inversions, in 15 frequently disrupted oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The assay uses a matched control and custom bioinformatics pipeline to differentiate between somatic and germline mutations, allowing precise variant classification. We tested 170 previously characterized samples, of which > 95% were formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue from 8 different cancer types, and highlight examples where lack of germline status may have led to the inappropriate prescription of therapy. We also describe the validation of the Affymetrix OncoScan platform, an array technology for high resolution copy number variant detection for use in parallel with the NGS panel that can detect single copy amplifications and hemizygous deletions. We analyzed 80 previously characterized formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens and provide examples of hemizygous deletion detection in samples with known pathogenic germline mutations. Thus, the TumorNext combined approach of NGS and OncoScan potentially allows for the identification of the "second hit" in hereditary cancer patients.	4
Prevalence of 35delG/GJB2 and del (GJB6-D13S1830) mutations in patients with non-syndromic deafness from a population of Espírito Santo-Brazil. || Adolescent Adult Brazil Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Cross-Sectional Studies Female Gene Frequency Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Prevalence Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || Mutations in GJB2 gene are the leading cause of deafness in autosomal recessive inheritance, and the 35delG mutation is the most common in many ethnic groups. Besides the 35delG mutation in homozygosis, the mutation is also found in compound heterozygosis, coupled with other mutations in genes GJB2 and GJB6. To determine the prevalence of 35delG/GJB2 and del (GJB6-D13S1830) mutations in patients with sensorineural hearing impairment in residents from the Espirito Santo state, Brazil. 77 unrelated individuals with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated. The 35delG mutation was studied by PCR / RFLP; and the del (GJB6-D13S1830) mutation was screened by the technique of multiplex PCR. 88.3% had normal genotype for the studied mutations, 1.3% were compound heterozygotes, 3.9% homozygotic for the 35delG mutation, 6.5% heterozygotic for 35delG/GJB2. The frequency of 35delG/GJB2 and del (D13S1830/GJB6) alleles in the sample was 7.8% and 0.65%, respectively. The data confirmed the existence of the mutations studied in cases of sensorineural hearing loss in a population from Espírito Santo / Brazil. These findings reinforce the importance of genetic diagnosis, which can provide early treatment for children and genetic counseling for the affected families.	4
Genetic predisposition in children with cancer - affected families' acceptance of Trio-WES. || Adolescent Adult Attitude to Health Child Child, Preschool Family Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Informed Consent Male Middle Aged Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary Prospective Studies Whole Exome Sequencing Young Adult || A considerable percentage of childhood cancers are due to cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS). The ratio of CPSs caused by inherited versus de novo germline mutations and the risk of recurrence in other children are unknown. We initiated a prospective study performing whole-exome sequencing (WES) of parent-child trios in children newly diagnosed with cancer. We initially aimed to determine the interest in and acceptance of trio WES among affected families and to systematically collect demographic, medical, and family history data to analyze whether these point to an underlying CPS. Between January 2015 and December 2016, 83 (88.3%) of 94 families participated; only 11 (11.7%) refused to participate. Five (6.0%) children presented with congenital malignancies and three (3.6%) with tumors with a high likelihood of an underlying CPS. Two (2.5%) families showed malignancies in family members < 18 years, 11 (13.8%) showed relatives < 45 years with cancer, 37 (46.3%) had a positive cancer history, and 14 (17.5%) families had > 1 relative with cancer. Genetic testing in pediatric oncology is of great interest to the families, and the vast majority opts for investigation into potentially underlying CPSs. Trio sequencing provides unique insights into CPS in pediatric cancers and is increasingly becoming a common approach in modern oncology, and thus, trio sequencing needs also to be integrated routinely into the practice of pediatric oncology. What is Known: • A considerable percentage of childhood cancers are due to cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS). What is New: • Knowing about an underlying CPS and, thus, the risk of recurrence in other children is of great interest to affected families.	4
Mutants TP53 p.R273H and p.R273C but not p.R273G enhance cancer cell malignancy. || Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cisplatin Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Humans Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Protein Conformation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutation of the tumor suppressor TP53 gene occurs in greater than half of all human cancers. In addition to loss of tumor suppressor function of wild-type TP53, gain-of-function mutations endow cancer cells with more malignant properties. R273 is a mutation hotspot with the p.R273H, p.R273C, and p.R273G variants occurring most commonly in patient samples. To better understand the consequences of these R273 mutations, we constructed cancer cell lines expressing TP53 p.R273H, p.R273C, or p.R273G and explored their characteristics. We found that p.R273H and p.R273C, but not p.R273G, enhanced proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance in vitro. Furthermore, breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 was upregulated by mutant TP53 p.R273H and p.R273C in response to DNA damage and repair. Transcriptional analysis of the TP53-R273 mutants by RNA-seq confirmed that the apoptosis pathway was less active in p.R273H and p.R273C, compared with R273G. Molecular dynamics simulation further revealed that TP53-R273G binds more tightly to DNA than TP53-R273H or TP53-R273C. These findings indicate that mutation of TP53 at a single codon has different effects, and likely clinical implications. p.R273H and p.R273C lead to a more aggressive phenotype than p.R273G. These findings may contribute to future diagnosis and therapy in TP53 mutant cancers.	0
How many mutant p53 molecules are needed to inactivate a tetramer? || Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cyclins DNA-Binding Proteins Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Models, Theoretical Mutation Nuclear Proteins Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Structure, Quaternary Protein Subunits Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Transcriptional Activation Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The tumor suppressor p53 is transcription factor composed of four identical subunits. The majority of the mutations in p53 are missense mutations that impair DNA binding. On the other hand, the p53-related p63 and p73 genes are rarely mutated, but many cell types express natural variants lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain (NDelta). Compelling evidence indicates that both the DNA binding-defective and NDelta mutants can impair the function of wild-type p53 in a dominant-negative manner. Interestingly, it is uncertain how many mutant subunit(s) a p53 tetramer can tolerate. In this study, we first made theoretical predictions based on the number of mutant p53 monomers needed to inactivate a tetramer and then tested how well the experimental data fit the predicted values. Surprisingly, these experiments reveal that DNA binding-defective p53 mutants (R249S and R273H) are very ineffective in impairing the transcriptional activity of p53: at least three mutants are required to inactivate a tetramer. In marked contrast, p53NDelta is a very potent inhibitor of p53: one NDelta subunit per tetramer is sufficient to abolish the transcriptional activity. DNA binding is not necessary for the NDelta proteins to inactivate p53. Similarly, NDelta variants of p63 and p73 are also powerful inhibitors of members of the p53 family. These results have important implications for our thinking about the mechanism of tumorigenesis involving missense p53 mutants or the N-terminally truncated isoforms.	0
Correlation between circulating mutant DNA and metabolic tumour burden in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung DNA, Neoplasm Female Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 Gene Frequency Glycolysis Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography Radiopharmaceuticals Retrospective Studies Survival Rate || Mutated circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been suggested as a surrogate marker of tumour burden and aggressiveness of disease. We examined the association between the level of plasma mutant cfDNA and metabolic tumour burden (MTB) measured by 18F-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT). Furthermore, the presence of mutant cfDNA was correlated with patient survival. Forty-six advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were included. At the time of inclusion, blood sampling and a PET/CT scan were performed. cfDNA was isolated and next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed (Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer panel v2). MTB was defined by a volumetric PET parameter. NGS succeeded in 41 patients. Mutations were detected in the blood of 24 patients. A significant correlation between the allele frequency of the most frequent mutation and MTB was found (P=0.001). Patients with detectable mutated cfDNA had a significantly shorter median overall survival compared with patients without (3.7 versus 10.6 months, P=0.019). This impact on survival was independent of the MTB. Level of mutated cfDNA tends to correlate with MTB in advanced-stage NSCLC patients. Patients with detectable mutant DNA in plasma had an inferior survival, indicating that this could be an important predictor of survival.	4
Targeted massively parallel sequencing characterises the mutation spectrum of PALB2 in breast and ovarian cancer cases from Poland and Ukraine. || Adult Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Poland Ukraine || Loss-of-function germline mutations in the PALB2 gene are associated with an increase of breast cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to characterise the spectrum of PALB2 mutations in women affected with breast or ovarian cancer from South-West Poland and West Ukraine. We applied Hi-Plex, an amplicon-based enrichment method for targeted massively parallel sequencing, to screen the coding exons and proximal intron-exon junctions of PALB2 in germline DNA from unrelated women affected with breast cancer (n = 338) and ovarian cancer (n = 89) from Poland (n = 304) and Ukraine (n = 123). These women were at high-risk of carrying a genetic predisposition to breast and/or ovarian cancer due to a family history and/or early-onset disease. Targeted-sequencing identified two frameshift deletions: PALB2:c.509_510del; p.R170Ifs in three women affected with breast cancer and PALB2:c.172_175del;p.Q60Rfs in one woman affected with ovarian cancer. A number of other previously described missense (some predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen-2 and CADD) and synonymous mutations were also identified in this population. This study is consistent with previous reports that PALB2:c.509_510del and PALB2:c.172_175del are recurrent mutations associated with breast cancer predisposition in Polish women with a family history of the disease. Our study contributes to the accumulating evidence indicating that PALB2 should be included in genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility in these populations to enhance risk assessment and management of women at high-risk of developing breast cancer. This data could also contribute to ongoing work that is assessing the possible association between ovarian cancer risk and PALB2 mutations for which there is currently no evidence.	4

Although it has been well established that such a gain of function is mainly achieved through interaction with transcriptional regulators, thereby modulating cancer-associated gene expression, how the mutp53 function is regulated remains elusive. Here we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) bound common mutp53 (e.g. R175H and R273H) and, subsequently, suppressed their oncogenic activities. ATF3 repressed mutp53-induced NFKB2 expression and sensitized R175H-expressing cancer cells to cisplatin and etoposide treatments. Moreover, ATF3 appeared to suppress R175H- and R273H-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion as a consequence of preventing the transcription factor p63 from inactivation by mutp53. Accordingly, ATF3 promoted the expression of the metastasis suppressor SHARP1 in mutp53-expressing cells. An ATF3 mutant devoid of the mutp53-binding domain failed to disrupt the mutp53-p63 binding and, thus, lost the activity to suppress mutp53-mediated migration, suggesting that ATF3 binds to mutp53 to suppress its oncogenic function. In line with these results, we found that down-regulation of ATF3 expression correlated with lymph node metastasis in TP53-mutated human lung cancer. We conclude that ATF3 can suppress mutp53 oncogenic function, thereby contributing to tumor suppression in TP53-mutated cancer.	0
Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia: needs for early diagnosis and cascade screening in the tunisian population. ||  || Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) is characterized by an isolated elevation of plasmatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which predisposes to premature coronary artery disease (CAD) and early death. ADH is largely due to mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR), the apolipoprotein B-100 gene (APOB), or the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment can modify the disease progression and its outcomes. Therefore, cascade screening protocol with a combination of plasmatic lipid measurements and DNA testing is used to identify relatives of index cases with a clinical diagnosis of ADH. In Tunisia, an attenuated phenotypic expression of ADH was previously reported, indicating that the establishment of a special screening protocol is necessary for this population.	4
Association and diagnostic utility of diastolic dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis in patients with Fabry disease. ||  || Current guidelines highlight important therapy implications of cardiac fibrosis in patients with Fabry disease (FD). However, association between morphological and functional impairments with cardiac fibrosis in hereditary cardiomyopathies remains elusive. We investigated the association between echocardiography-determined cardiac dysfunction and cardiac MRI (cMRI)-detected myocardial fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement, LE) in patients with FD with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (≥50%). 146 patients with FD (aged 39±14 years, 57 men) were analysed, all receiving echocardiography and cMRI within a 1 week interval. Longitudinal systolic strain (LS_sys), strain rate (LSr_sys) and diastolic strain rate (LSr_E/LSr_A) were assessed using speckle-tracking imaging. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to identify the diagnostic performance of various markers for LE. LE was detected in 57 (39%) patients with FD. LV wall thickness, left atrial volume, septal E/e', diastolic dysfunction grade, global LS_sys and E/LSr_E, mid-lateral LS_sys and LSr_E, as well as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were all associated with LE independent of age, sex, body mass index, New York Heart Association functional class and kidney function. In ROC curve analysis, septal E/e' performed best (area under the curve=0.86, 95% CI=0.79 to 0.92). Septal E/e'>14.8 was strongly associated with LE (specificity=97.8% and sensitivity=49.1%). In 9% of patients, localised LE was present even though no other cardiac or kidney abnormalities were detected. Echocardiography-derived diastolic dysfunction is closely linked to LE in FD. Septal E/e' ratio is the best echocardiographic marker suggestive of LE. Diastolic dysfunction is not a prerequisite for LE in FD, since LE can be detected in the absence of measurable cardiac functional impairments. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT03362164).	4
Etiologic diagnosis of nonsyndromic genetic hearing loss in adult vs pediatric populations. || Adolescent Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins Female Genetic Testing Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Middle Aged Mutation Young Adult || Determine the diagnostic yield of a shared genetic testing algorithm in adult and pediatric populations with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and recommend effective testing strategies to evaluate for genetic causes of deafness in patients presenting with idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Hospital-based cohort study. University of Miami outpatient otology clinics between 2001 and 2010. Two hundred twenty-one adult and 163 pediatric patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Peripheral blood samples were screened for mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 and mitochondrial DNA mutations 1555A>G, 7444G>A, and 3243A>G. Audiometric data and family history were also collected. GJB2/GJB6-related deafness was diagnosed in 23 of 163 pediatric patients (14%) compared with only 3 of 221 adults (1%). All adults had a family history of hearing loss, and 2 patients noted deafness onset at birth. Nineteen GJB2 mutations were identified with 35delG the most common mutation. The 35delG homozygous state was the most common pathogenic genotype (54%). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations were found in 6 adult probands (3%). No mtDNA mutations were found in pediatric patients. Testing for common GJB2/GJB6 mutations in pediatric patients has considerable value in establishing an etiologic diagnosis for SNHL. Similar testing in adults is of very low yield except perhaps in cases of early-onset SNHL or strong family history. Mitochondrial DNA testing should be considered in adults with idiopathic SNHL.	4
Trans-ethnic fine-mapping of lipid loci identifies population-specific signals and allelic heterogeneity that increases the trait variance explained. || African Americans Apolipoprotein A-V Apolipoproteins A Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL European Continental Ancestry Group Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Lipoproteins, HDL Lipoproteins, LDL Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Serine Endopeptidases Triglycerides || Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~100 loci associated with blood lipid levels, but much of the trait heritability remains unexplained, and at most loci the identities of the trait-influencing variants remain unknown. We conducted a trans-ethnic fine-mapping study at 18, 22, and 18 GWAS loci on the Metabochip for their association with triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), respectively, in individuals of African American (n = 6,832), East Asian (n = 9,449), and European (n = 10,829) ancestry. We aimed to identify the variants with strongest association at each locus, identify additional and population-specific signals, refine association signals, and assess the relative significance of previously described functional variants. Among the 58 loci, 33 exhibited evidence of association at P<1 × 10(-4) in at least one ancestry group. Sequential conditional analyses revealed that ten, nine, and four loci in African Americans, Europeans, and East Asians, respectively, exhibited two or more signals. At these loci, accounting for all signals led to a 1.3- to 1.8-fold increase in the explained phenotypic variance compared to the strongest signals. Distinct signals across ancestry groups were identified at PCSK9 and APOA5. Trans-ethnic analyses narrowed the signals to smaller sets of variants at GCKR, PPP1R3B, ABO, LCAT, and ABCA1. Of 27 variants reported previously to have functional effects, 74% exhibited the strongest association at the respective signal. In conclusion, trans-ethnic high-density genotyping and analysis confirm the presence of allelic heterogeneity, allow the identification of population-specific variants, and limit the number of candidate SNPs for functional studies.	4
Tongue carcinoma infrequently harbor common actionable genetic alterations. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Squamous Cell DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Staging Patient Outcome Assessment Tongue Neoplasms Young Adult || Oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (TSCC) are a unique subset of head and neck cancers with a distinct demographic profile, where up to half of the cases are never smokers. A small proportion of patients with OSCC are known to respond to EGFR TKI. We used a high-sensitivity mass spectrometry-based mutation profiling platform to determine the EGFR mutation status, as well as other actionable alterations in a series of Asian TSCC. 66 TSCC patients treated between 1998-2009 with complete clinico-pathologic data were included in this study. Somatic mutation profiling was performed using Sequenom LungCarta v1.0, and correlated with clinical parameters. Mutations were identified in 20/66(30.3%) of samples and involved TP53, STK11, MET, PIK3CA, BRAF and NRF2. No activating EGFR mutations or KRAS mutations were discovered in our series, where just over a third were never smokers. The most common mutations were in p53 (10.6%; n = 7) and MET (10.6%, n = 11) followed by STK11 (9.1%, n = 6) and PIK3CA (4.5%, n = 3). BRAF and NRF2 mutations, which are novel in TSCC, were demonstrated in one sample each. There was no significant correlation between overall mutation status and smoking history (p = 0.967) or age (p = 0.360). Positive MET alteration was associated with poorer loco-regional recurrence free survival (LRFS) of 11 months [vs 90 months in MET-negative group (p = 0.008)]. None of the other mutations were significantly correlated with LRFS or overall survival. Four of these tumors were propagated as immortalized cell lines and demonstrated the same mutations as the original tumor. Using the Sequenom multiplexed LungCarta panel, we identified mutations in 6 genes, TP53, STK11, MET, PIK3CA, BRAF and NRF2, with the notable absence of EGFR and HER2 mutations in our series of Asian OSCC. Primary cell line models recapitulated the mutation profiles of the original primary tumours and provide an invaluable resource for experimental cancer therapeutics.	4
In vivo assessment of mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene by phenylalanine loading: characterization of seven common mutations. || Alleles DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Phenotype Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Point Mutation || Mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) cause persistent hyperphenylalaninaemia. To date, more than 200 point mutations and microdeletions have been characterized. Each mutation has a particular quantitative effect on enzyme activity and recessive expression of different mutant alleles results in a marked interindividual heterogeneity of metabolic and clinical phenotypes. In this paper we demonstrate how a simple clinical test can be used to evaluate the correlation between mutation genotype and phenylalanine metabolism. In hyperphenylalaninaemic patients with known PAH mutation genotype, we have investigated phenylalanine turnover in vivo by measuring the ability to eliminate a test dose of L-phenylalanine. All patients could be considered functionally hemizygous for one of their mutant alleles by carrying on the other allele a mutation that is known to completely abolish PAH activity and encode a peptide with no immunoreactivity. Seven mutations (R408W, IVS-12nt1, R261Q, G46S, Y414C, A104D, and D415N) were characterized by oral phenylalanine loading, each mutation being represented by at least three patients. The elimination profile determined for a 3-day period provides a measure to compare residual activity of the mutant proteins and to assign each mutation to a particular metabolic phenotype. The established relation between genotype and phenotype may enable prediction of the severity of the disease by genotype determination in the newborn period. This will aid in the management of hyperphenylalaninaemia and may improve prognosis. The possibility of predicting the residual enzyme activity by DNA analysis performed already in the newborn period allows the prompt implementation of a diet that is adjusted to the degree of PAH deficiency. This may improve management and prognosis of hyperphenylalaninaemia.	1 3
Tissue-Specific Signaling Networks Rewired by Major Somatic Mutations in Human Cancer Revealed by Proteome-Wide Discovery. || Carcinogenesis Humans Mutation Neoplasms Phosphorylation Proteome Signal Transduction || Massive somatic mutations discovered by large cancer genome sequencing projects provide unprecedented opportunities in the development of precision oncology. However, deep understanding of functional consequences of somatic mutations and identifying actionable mutations and the related drug responses currently remain formidable challenges. Dysfunction of protein posttranslational modification plays critical roles in tumorigenesis and drug responses. In this study, we proposed a novel computational oncoproteomics approach, named kinome-wide network module for cancer pharmacogenomics (KNMPx), for identifying actionable mutations that rewired signaling networks and further characterized tumorigenesis and anticancer drug responses. Specifically, we integrated 746,631 missense mutations in 4,997 tumor samples across 16 major cancer types/subtypes from The Cancer Genome Atlas into over 170,000 carefully curated nonredundant phosphorylation sites covering 18,610 proteins. We found 47 mutated proteins (e.g., ERBB2, TP53, and CTNNB1) that had enriched missense mutations at their phosphorylation sites in pan-cancer analysis. In addition, tissue-specific kinase-substrate interaction modules altered by somatic mutations identified by KNMPx were significantly associated with patient survival. We further reported a kinome-wide landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions by incorporating somatic mutation-rewired signaling networks in 1,001 cancer cell lines via KNMPx. Interestingly, we found that cell lines could highly reproduce oncogenic phosphorylation site mutations identified in primary tumors, supporting the confidence in their associations with sensitivity/resistance of inhibitors targeting EGF, MAPK, PI3K, mTOR, and Wnt signaling pathways. In summary, our KNMPx approach is powerful for identifying oncogenic alterations via rewiring phosphorylation-related signaling networks and drug sensitivity/resistance in the era of precision oncology.

P53 hot-spot mutants are resistant to ubiquitin-independent degradation by increased binding to NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1. || Animals Apoptosis Arginine Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Cysteine Endopeptidases DNA Mutational Analysis Dicumarol Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Genes, p53 Humans Immunoblotting Mice Multienzyme Complexes Mutation NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone) Nuclear Proteins Plasmids Precipitin Tests Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Protein Binding Protein Conformation Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin || Proteasomal degradation of p53 is mediated by two alternative pathways that are either dependent or independent of both Mdm2 and ubiquitin. The ubiquitin-independent pathway is regulated by NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) that stabilizes p53. The NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol induces ubiquitin-independent p53 degradation. We now show that, like dicoumarol, several other coumarin and flavone inhibitors of NQO1 activity, which compete with NAD(P)H for binding to NQO1, induced ubiquitin-independent p53 degradation and inhibited wild-type p53-mediated apoptosis. Although wild-type p53 and several p53 mutants were sensitive to dicoumarol-induced degradation, the most frequent "hot-spot" p53 mutants in human cancer, R175H, R248H, and R273H, were resistant to dicoumarol-induced degradation, but remained sensitive to Mdm2-ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The two alternative pathways for p53 degradation thus have different p53 structural requirements. Further mutational analysis showed that arginines at positions 175 and 248 were essential for dicoumarol-induced p53 degradation. NQO1 bound to wild-type p53 and dicoumarol, which induced a conformational change in NQO1, inhibited this binding. Compared with wild-type p53, the hot-spot p53 mutants showed increased binding to NQO1, which can explain their resistance to dicoumarol-induced degradation. NQO1 thus has an important role in stabilizing hot-spot p53 mutant proteins in human cancer.	0
Simultaneous detection of multiple familial hypercholesterolemia mutations facilitates an improved diagnostic service in South african patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. ||  || DNA testing can provide a definitive diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), even in the absence of the clinical characteristics of this inherited cardiovascular disease (CVD) subtype. Our aim was to design a rapid diagnostic assay capable of simultaneously analyzing seven point mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene, which occur at high frequency in South African FH patients. The test is based on multiplex DNA amplification and hybridization to membrane strips presenting a parallel array of immobilized allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. A reverse-hybridization assay for genotyping LDLR point mutations D154N, D200G, D206E, C356Y, G361V, V408M, and P664L was set-up and validated using pretyped human DNA samples, as well as recombinant plasmid clones containing mutant alleles. The procedure is rapid (6 hours) and may be automated to a large extent. The new FH strip-assay forms an important part of the comprehensive cardiovascular genetic screen offered routinely to high-risk population groups in South Africa. A genetic approach based on FH testing in conjunction with other 'genetic' CVD risk factors is feasible and justified, since the spectrum of disease-related mutations have been defined to a large extent in the genetically distinct population groups of South Africa. Knowledge of a significantly increased CVD risk due to the presence of gene variations, which can be targeted for risk reduction by the avoidance of relevant environmental risk factors and the appropriate treatment, provides a powerful message to motivate people into implementing preventative measures based on their genetic profile.	4
[An analysis of the mutation in GJB2，GJB3，SLC26A4 and mtDNA12SrRNA in new born]. || gene mutation hearing loss new born || <b>Objective:</b>To analyze deafness gene mutation in GJB2，GJB3，SLC26A4 and mtDNA12SrRNA in newborn and to explore the significance of genetic test and potential correlations between the genotype and clinical phenotype.<b>Method:</b>Blood samples were collected with a standard protocol and DNA templates are extracted from 501 newborn in Longgang of Shenzhen.MALDI-TOF-MS Technology was used to detect the coding region twenty mutations sites of GJB2，GJB3，SLC26A4 AND mtDNA12SrRNA，includingSLC26A4(1226G>A,1229C>T,281C>T,589G>A,IVS7-2A>T,1174A>T,IVS15+5G>A,1975G>C,2027T>A,2162C>T,2168A>G),GJB2(176-191del16,35delG,167delT,235 delC,299-300 delAT),GJB3(547G>A,538C>T),mtDNA12SrRNA(1555A>G,1494C>T).While two-step hearing screening was carried by using AABR（automatedauditory brainstem response）and DPOAE. <b>Result:</b>In the 501 newborns,26 cases were found have one or two allele mutations of deafness-susceptibility genes.GJB2 gene mutation(n=9,1.796%) all were 235 delC single heterozygosity mutation.GJB3 gene mutation(n=3,0.599%).

Carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons induce CYP1A1 in human cells via a p53-dependent mechanism. || Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors Benzo(a)pyrene Carcinogens Cell Survival Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1 Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1 Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inducers DNA Adducts DNA Damage HCT116 Cells Humans Inactivation, Metabolic NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon Toxicity Tests Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumour suppressor gene TP53 is mutated in more than 50 % of human tumours, making it one of the most important cancer genes. We have investigated the role of TP53 in cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolic activation of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a panel of isogenic colorectal HCT116 cells with differing TP53 status. Cells that were TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-), TP53(-/-), TP53(R248W/+) or TP53(R248W/-) were treated with benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), dibenz[a,h]anthracene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, and the formation of DNA adducts was measured by (32)P-postlabelling analysis. Each PAH formed significantly higher DNA adduct levels in TP53(+/+) cells than in the other cell lines. There were also significantly lower levels of PAH metabolites in the culture media of these other cell lines. Bypass of the need for metabolic activation by treating cells with the corresponding reactive PAH-diol-epoxide metabolites resulted in similar adduct levels in all cell lines, which confirms that the influence of p53 is on the metabolism of the parent PAHs. Western blotting showed that CYP1A1 protein expression was induced to much greater extent in TP53(+/+) cells than in the other cell lines. CYP1A1 is inducible via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), but we did not find that expression of AHR was dependent on p53; rather, we found that BaP-induced CYP1A1 expression was regulated through p53 binding to a p53 response element in the CYP1A1 promoter region, thereby enhancing its transcription. This study demonstrates a new pathway for CYP1A1 induction by environmental PAHs and reveals an emerging role for p53 in xenobiotic metabolism.	0
Metastatic melanoma cells with BRAF G469A mutation: nab-paclitaxel better than vemurafenib? || Albumins Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Indoles Melanoma Mutation, Missense Paclitaxel Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Sulfonamides Vemurafenib || BRAF G469A is a missense mutation within exon 11 of the BRAF gene resulting in a constitutively activated enzyme frequently associated with MAP kinase cascade signaling activation. No evidence currently exists about its role in determining sensitivity/resistance to BRAF inhibitors, utilized in the treatment of patients carrying BRAF V600 mutations, and to chemotherapy. The newly established metastatic melanoma (MM) cell line MO-1 was characterized for its sensitivity to vemurafenib and nab-paclitaxel, both already utilized for the treatment of MM. All analyses were carried out by comparing results with those found in MM cells wild type for BRAF or mutated in V600. In addition, cellular effectors were investigated by ELISA kits, western blotting and flow cytometry. The exposure to vemurafenib inhibited MO-1 cell proliferation at concentrations similar to those obtained in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma models, and an explanation of this sensitivity is the strong activation of Erk1/2 and the low expression of MITF. Nab-paclitaxel strongly reduced proliferation of MO-1 cells perhaps for the very low expression level of PMEL17, transcriptionally regulated by MITF and negatively involved in determining sensitivity to taxanes. Thus, the mutation BRAF G469A in MM might be related to a weak effectiveness of therapy with BRAF inhibitors and a promising therapeutic approach may be with nab-paclitaxel.	0
Metabolic changes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathies: scientific update from the Working Group of Myocardial Function of the European Society of Cardiology. ||  || Disturbed metabolism as a consequence of obesity and diabetes may cause cardiac diseases (recently highlighted in the cardiovascular research spotlight issue on metabolic cardiomyopathies).1 In turn, the metabolism of the heart may also be disturbed in genetic and acquired forms of hypertrophic cardiac disease. Herein, we provide an overview of recent insights on metabolic changes in genetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and discuss several therapies, which may be explored to target disturbed metabolism and prevent onset of cardiac hypertrophy.This article is part of the Mini Review Series from the Varenna 2017 meeting of the Working Group of Myocardial Function of the European Society of Cardiology.	4
PRIMA-1(MET) induces death in soft-tissue sarcomas cell independent of p53. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Autophagy Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 MAP Kinase Signaling System Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial Quinuclidines Reactive Oxygen Species Sarcoma Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and define mechanisms of action of PRIMA-1(MET) as a TP53 targeted therapy in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) cells. We investigated effects of PRIMA-1(MET) on apoptosis, cell cycle, and induction of oxidative stress and autophagy in a panel of 6 STS cell lines with different TP53 status. Cell viability reduction by PRIMA-1(MET) was significantly observed in 5 out of 6 STS cell lines. We found that PRIMA-1(MET) was capable to induce cell death not only in STS cells harboring mutated TP53 but also in TP53-null STS cells demonstrating that PRIMA-1(MET) can induce cell death independently of TP53 in STS cells. We identified an important role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), involved in PRIMA-1(MET) toxicity in STS cells leading to a caspase-independent cell death. ROS toxicity was associated with autophagy induction or JNK pathway activation which represented potential mechanisms of cell death induced by PRIMA-1(MET) in STS. PRIMA-1(MET) anti-tumor activity in STS partly results from off-target effects involving ROS toxicity and do not deserve further development as a TP53-targeted therapy in this setting.	0
More targets, more pathways and more clues for mutant p53. ||  || Mutations in the transcription factor p53 are among the most common genetic alterations in human cancer, and missense p53 mutations in cancer cells can lead to aggressive phenotypes. So far, only few studies investigated transcriptional reprogramming under mutant p53 expression as a means to identify deregulated targets and pathways. A review of the literature was carried out focusing on mutant p53-dependent transcriptome changes with the aims of (i) verifying whether different p53 mutations can be equivalent for their effects, or whether there is a mutation-specific transcriptional reprogramming of target genes, (ii) understanding what is the main mechanism at the basis of upregulation or downregulation of gene expression under the p53 mutant background, (iii) identifying novel candidate target genes of WT and/or mutant p53 and (iv) defining cellular pathways affected by the mutant p53-dependent gene expression reprogramming. Nearly 600 genes were consistently found upregulated or downregulated upon ectopic expression of mutant p53, regardless of the specific p53 mutation studied. Promoter analysis and the use of ChIP-seq data indicate that, for most genes, the expression changes could be ascribed to a loss both of WT p53 transcriptional activation and repressor functions. Pathway analysis indicated changes in the metabolism/catabolism of amino acids such as aspartate, glutamate, arginine and proline. Novel p53 candidate target genes were also identified, including ARID3B, ARNT2, CLMN, FADS1, FTH1, KPNA2, LPHN2, PARD6B, PDE4C, PIAS2, PRPF40A, PYGL and RHOBTB2, involved in the metabolism, xenobiotic responses and cell differentiation.	0
CYK-4 regulates Rac, but not Rho, during cytokinesis. || Actin Cytoskeleton Actins Animals Caenorhabditis elegans Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins Cytokinesis GTPase-Activating Proteins Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors Myosin Type II Single-Cell Analysis rac GTP-Binding Proteins rho-Associated Kinases rhoA GTP-Binding Protein || Cytokinesis is driven by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring that is controlled by Rho-family small GTPases. Rho, activated by the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor ECT-2, is upstream of both myosin-II activation and diaphanous formin-mediated filamentous actin (f-actin) assembly, which drive ring constriction. The role for Rac and its regulators is more controversial, but, based on the finding that Rac inactivation can rescue cytokinesis failure when the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) CYK-4 is disrupted, Rac activity was proposed to be inhibitory to contractile ring constriction and thus specifically inactivated by CYK-4 at the division plane. An alternative model proposes that Rac inactivation generally rescues cytokinesis failure by reducing cortical tension, thus making it easier for the cell to divide when ring constriction is compromised. In this alternative model, CYK-4 was instead proposed to activate Rho by binding ECT-2. Using a combination of time-lapse in vivo single-cell analysis and Caenorhabditis elegans genetics, our evidence does not support this alternative model. First, we found that Rac disruption does not generally rescue cytokinesis failure: inhibition of Rac specifically rescues cytokinesis failure due to disruption of CYK-4 or ECT-2 but does not rescue cytokinesis failure due to disruption of two other contractile ring components, the Rho effectors diaphanous formin and myosin-II. Second, if CYK-4 regulates cytokinesis through Rho rather than Rac, then CYK-4 inhibition should decrease levels of downstream targets of Rho. Inconsistent with this, we found no change in the levels of f-actin or myosin-II at the division plane when CYK-4 GAP activity was reduced, suggesting that CYK-4 is not upstream of ECT-2/Rho activation. Instead, we found that the rescue of cytokinesis in CYK-4 mutants by Rac inactivation was Cdc42 dependent. Together our data suggest that CYK-4 GAP activity opposes Rac (and perhaps Cdc42) during cytokinesis.	0
Nonradioactive multiplex PCR screening strategy for the simultaneous detection of multiple low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations. || Base Sequence DNA DNA Primers Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel Europe Exons Humans Hypercholesterolemia Molecular Sequence Data Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Genetic Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Receptors, LDL Sequence Deletion South Africa || We have developed a rapid, nonradioactive screening test enabling the simultaneous analysis of three low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene mutations (D154N, D206E, and V408M), which together account for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in approximately 90% of the South African Afrikaner population. The assay is designed so that FH patients, negative for these founder-related mutations (found in descendants of European settlers), subsequently can be screened for unknown mutations in the mutation-rich exon 4 of the LDLR gene. Our screening assay consists of two steps: (1) multiplex allele-specific PCR amplification of exons 4 and 9, and (2) simultaneous analysis of single- and double-strand conformational polymorphisms in exon 4 by vertical electrophoresis on low cross-linked polyacrylamide gels. The simplicity, specificity, and versatility of the multiplex assay makes it an ideal system for routine screening of FH mutations in large population samples.	4
Role Played by Signalling Pathways in Overcoming BRAF Inhibitor Resistance in Melanoma. || Animals Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Melanoma Models, Biological Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Signal Transduction || The discovery of the BRAFV600E mutation led to the development of vemurafenib (PLX4032), a selective BRAF inhibitor specific to the kinase, for the treatment of metastatic melanomas. However, initial success of the drug was dampened by the development of acquired resistance. Melanoma was shown to relapse in patients following treatment with vemurafenib which eventually led to patients' deaths. It has been proposed that mechanisms of resistance can be due to (1) reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway via secondary mutations, amplification or activation of target kinase(s), (2) the bypass of oncogenic pathway via activation of alternative signalling pathways, (3) other uncharacterized mechanisms. Studies showed that receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as PDGFRβ, IGF1R, EGFR and c-Met were overexpressed in melanoma cells. Along with increased secretion of growth factors such as HGF and TGF-α, this will trigger intracellular signalling cascades. This review discusses the role MAPK and Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-protein kinase B-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathways play in the mechanism of resistance of melanomas.	0
[Mutation in the structure of exon 7 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase in phenylketonuria patients from the Novosibirsk area]. || Exons Humans Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Siberia || The spectrum and frequency of mutations of exon 7 of the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) were studied in 34 phenylketonuria (PKU) patients living in Novosibirsk oblast. The five most prevalent mutations constituted 17.64% of defective alleles: R243Q (1.47%), R252W (1.47%), R261Q (5.88%), E280K (1.47%), and P281L (7.35%). A neutral polymorphic locus V245V was found within exon 7.	3
Validation of Ion Torrent<sup>TM</sup> Inherited Disease Panel with the PGM<sup>TM</sup> Sequencing Platform for Rapid and Comprehensive Mutation Detection. || AmpliSeq Inherited Disease Panel Saudi Human Genome Program database gene panel inherited diseases mutations targeted NGS || Quick and accurate molecular testing is necessary for the better management of many inherited diseases. Recent technological advances in various next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, such as target panel-based sequencing, has enabled comprehensive, quick, and precise interrogation of many genetic variations. As a result, these technologies have become a valuable tool for gene discovery and for clinical diagnostics. The AmpliSeq Inherited Disease Panel (IDP) consists of 328 genes underlying more than 700 inherited diseases. Here, we aimed to assess the performance of the IDP as a sensitive and rapid comprehensive gene panel testing. A total of 88 patients with inherited diseases and causal mutations that were previously identified by Sanger sequencing were randomly selected for assessing the performance of the IDP. The IDP successfully detected 93.1% of the mutations in our validation cohort, achieving high overall gene coverage (98%). The sensitivity for detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short Indels was 97.3% and 69.2%, respectively. IDP, when coupled with Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM), delivers comprehensive and rapid sequencing for genes that are responsible for various inherited diseases. Our validation results suggest the suitability of this panel for use as a first-line screening test after applying the necessary clinical validation.	4
Intrinsically disordered domain of tumor suppressor p53 facilitates target search by ultrafast transfer between different DNA strands. ||  || Intersegmental transfer (IST) is an important strategy in the target search used by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (DBPs), enabling DBPs to search for targets between multiple DNA strands without dissociation. We examined the IST of the tumor suppressor p53 using ensemble stopped-flow and single-molecule fluorescence measurements. The ensemble measurements demonstrated that p53 exhibits very fast IST, whose rate constant was ∼108 M-1 s-1. To determine the domains of p53 responsible for IST, two mutants with deletions of one of its two DNA binding domains were generated. The mutant lacking the disordered C-terminal (CT) domain (the CoreTet mutant) abolished IST, whereas the mutant lacking the structured core domain (the TetCT mutant) maintained IST, clearly demonstrating the importance of the CT domain. Single-molecule fluorescence measurements further demonstrated the transfer of p53 between two tethered DNA strands. The pseudo-wild-type p53 and the TetCT mutant showed significant transfer efficiencies, whereas the transfer efficiency for the CoreTet mutant was zero. These results suggest that ultrafast IST might be promoted by four copies of the CT domain, by binding to two DNA strands simultaneously. Such ultrafast IST might be important to avoid nearby-bound DBPs during the target search process of p53 in nucleus.	0
RAF inhibitors promote RAS-RAF interaction by allosterically disrupting RAF autoinhibition. || Allosteric Regulation Cell Line, Tumor Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases HEK293 Cells Humans Models, Biological Mutation Phosphorylation Protein Binding Protein Kinase Inhibitors Protein Multimerization Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || First-generation RAF inhibitors paradoxically induce ERK signaling in normal and tumor cells exhibiting RAS activity. Compound-induced RAF dimerization through stabilization of the RAF ON/active state by inhibitors has emerged as a critical contributing factor. RAF inhibitors also enhance RAS-RAF association. Although this event is thought to play a key role in priming RAF activation, the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we report that RAF inhibitors induce the disruption of intramolecular interactions between the kinase domain and its N-terminal regulatory region independently of RAS activity. This provides a molecular basis to explain the induction of RAS-RAF association by RAF inhibitors, as well as the co-operativity observed between RAS activity and RAF kinase inhibitors in driving RAF activation. Profiling of second-generation RAF inhibitors confirmed their improved mode of action, but also revealed liabilities that allowed us to discern two properties of an ideal RAF inhibitor: high-binding affinity to all RAF paralogs and maintenance of the OFF/autoinhibited state of the enzyme.	0
Contribution of the Type II Chaperonin, TRiC/CCT, to Oncogenesis. || Apoptosis Carcinogenesis Chaperonin Containing TCP-1 Disease Progression Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genomic Instability HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins Humans Neoplasm Proteins Neoplasms Protein Conformation Protein Folding Signal Transduction || The folding of newly synthesized proteins and the maintenance of pre-existing proteins are essential in sustaining a living cell. A network of molecular chaperones tightly guides the folding, intracellular localization, and proteolytic turnover of proteins. Many of the key regulators of cell growth and differentiation have been identified as clients of molecular chaperones, which implies that chaperones are potential mediators of oncogenesis. In this review, we briefly provide an overview of the role of chaperones, including HSP70 and HSP90, in cancer. We further summarize and highlight the emerging the role of chaperonin TRiC (T-complex protein-1 ring complex, also known as CCT) in the development and progression of cancer mediated through its critical interactions with oncogenic clients that modulate growth deregulation, apoptosis, and genome instability in cancer cells. Elucidation of how TRiC modulates the folding and function of oncogenic clients will provide strategies for developing novel cancer therapies.	0
Prevalence and clinical features of hearing loss patients with CDH23 mutations: a large cohort study. || Adolescent Adult Aged Alleles Cadherins Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Consanguinity Exons Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genotype Hearing Loss Hearing Tests Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Prevalence Young Adult || Screening for gene mutations in CDH23, which has many exons, has lagged even though it is likely to be an important cause for hearing loss patients. To assess the importance of CDH23 mutations in non-syndromic hearing loss, two-step screening was applied and clinical characteristics of the patients with CDH23 mutations were examined in this study. As a first screening, we performed Sanger sequencing using 304 probands compatible with recessive inheritance to find the pathologic mutations. Twenty-six possible mutations were detected to be pathologic in the first screening. For the second screening, using the probes for these 26 mutations, a large cohort of probands (n = 1396) was screened using Taqman amplification-based mutation analysis followed by Sanger sequencing. The hearing loss in a total of 52 families (10 homozygous, 13 compound heterogygous, and 29 heterozygous) was found to be caused by the CDH23 mutations. The majority of the patients showed congenital, high frequency involved, progressive hearing loss. Interestingly, some particular mutations cause late onset moderate hearing loss. The present study is the first to demonstrate the prevalence of CDH23 mutations among non-syndromic hearing loss patients and indicated that mutations of the CDH23 gene are an important cause of non-syndromic hearing loss.	4
Update of the GJB2/DFNB1 mutation spectrum in Russia: a founder Ingush mutation del(GJB2-D13S175) is the most frequent among other large deletions. || Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexins Female Founder Effect Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Male Mutation Russia Sequence Deletion || Although mutations in the GJB2 gene sequence make up the majority of variants causing autosomal-recessive non-syndromic hearing loss, few large deletions have been shown to contribute to DFNB1 deafness. Currently, genetic testing for DFNB1 hearing loss includes GJB2 sequencing and DFNB1 deletion analysis for two common large deletions, del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854). Here, we report frequency in Russia, clinical significance and evolutionary origins of a 101 kb deletion, del(GJB2-D13S175), recently identified by us. In multiethnic cohort of 1104 unrelated hearing loss patients with biallelic mutations at the DFNB1 locus, the del(GJB2-D13S175) allele frequency of up to 0.5% (11/2208) was determined and this allele was shown to be predominantly associated with profound sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, eight previously unpublished GJB2 mutations were described in this study. All patients carrying del(GJB2-D13S175) were of the Ingush ancestry. Among normal hearing individuals, del(GJB2-D13S175) was observed in Russian Republic of Ingushetia with a carrier rate of ~1% (2/241). Analysis of haplotypes associated with the deletion revealed a common founder in the Ingushes, with age of the deletion being ~3000 years old. Since del(GJB2-D13S175) was missed by standard methods of GJB2 analysis, del(GJB2-D13S175) detection has been added to our routine testing strategy for DFNB1 hearing loss.	4
Molecular Heterogeneity of Ewing Sarcoma as Detected by Ion Torrent Sequencing. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Sarcoma, Ewing Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most common malignant bone and soft tissue tumor in children and adolescents. Despite advances in comprehensive treatment, patients with ES metastases still suffer poor outcomes, thus, emphasizing the need for detailed genetic profiles of ES patients to identify suitable molecular biomarkers for improved prognosis and development of effective and targeted therapies. In this study, the next generation sequencing Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 was used to identify cancer-related gene mutations in the tissue samples from 20 ES patients. This platform targeted 207 amplicons of 2800 loci in 50 cancer-related genes. Among the 20 tissue specimens, 62 nonsynonymous hotspot mutations were identified in 26 cancer-related genes, revealing the molecular heterogeneity of ES. Among these, five novel mutations in cancer-related genes (KDR, STK11, MLH1, KRAS, and PTPN11) were detected in ES, and these mutations were confirmed with traditional Sanger sequencing. ES patients with KDR, STK11, and MLH1 mutations had higher Ki-67 proliferation indices than the ES patients lacking such mutations. Notably, more than half of the ES patients harbored one or two possible 'druggable' mutations that have been previously linked to a clinical cancer treatment option. Our results provided the foundation to not only elucidate possible mechanisms involved in ES pathogenesis but also indicated the utility of Ion Torrent sequencing as a sensitive and cost-effective tool to screen key oncogenes and tumor suppressors in order to develop personalized therapy for ES patients.	4
The implications of familial incidental findings from exome sequencing: the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program experience. || Adolescent Adult Child Cohort Studies Exome Family Health Female Genetic Counseling Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genome, Human Humans Incidental Findings Male Metabolism, Inborn Errors Middle Aged National Institutes of Health (U.S.) Sequence Analysis, DNA United States Young Adult || Using exome sequence data from 159 families participating in the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program, we evaluated the number and inheritance mode of reportable incidental sequence variants. Following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for reporting of incidental findings from next-generation sequencing, we extracted variants in 56 genes from the exome sequence data of 543 subjects and determined the reportable incidental findings for each participant. We also defined variant status as inherited or de novo for those with available parental sequence data. We identified 14 independent reportable variants in 159 (8.8%) families. For nine families with parental sequence data in our cohort, a parent transmitted the variant to one or more children (nine minor children and four adult children). The remaining five variants occurred in adults for whom parental sequences were unavailable. Our results are consistent with the expectation that a small percentage of exomes will result in identification of an incidental finding under the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations. Additionally, our analysis of family sequence data highlights that genome and exome sequencing of families has unavoidable implications for immediate family members and therefore requires appropriate counseling for the family.	4
Differentially expressed downstream genes in cells with normal or mutated p53. ||  || Mutations in p53 gene could lead to loss of function, negative complementation, or to gain-of-oncogenic functions, thus leading to the increase of tumorigenicity and invasiveness of cancer. This study focused on cancer-related p53 mutants, including A138T, C141Y, RI58L, G245C, and R248Q. Using a modified differential display technique, response profiles of plasmid-expressed wild-type as well as mutated p53, in comparison to p53-null cells, are being established. These profiles can help our understanding of p53 involvement in cancer, leading to accurate diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic analysis by: 1) comprehensive knowledge of p53 network gene expression profiles; 2) finding the most significant gene expression profiles of p53 mutants; 3) revealing genes that only respond to p53 mutants (gain of function). Our results showed significant differences in the expression patterns among p53-null. wild-type p53, and p53 mutants A138T, C141Y, R158L, G245C, and R248Q samples. We also report here the first found p53 mutant-triggered alternative splicing.	0
Chromosome 19q13 disruption alters expressions of CYP2A7, MIA and MIA-RAB4B lncRNA and contributes to FAP-like phenotype in APC mutation-negative familial colorectal cancer patients. || Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19 Colorectal Neoplasms Cytochrome P450 Family 2 Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female Genes, APC Humans Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases Male Neoplasm Proteins Pedigree RNA, Long Noncoding || Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited form of colorectal cancer (CRC) caused by mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Our ability to exhaustively screen for APC mutations identify microsatellite-stable and APC-mutation negative familial CRC patients, enabling us to search for novel genes. We performed genome-wide scan on two affected siblings of one family and 88 ethnicity- and gender-matched healthy controls to identify deletions shared by the siblings. Combined loss of heterozygosity, copy number and allelic-specific copy number analysis uncovered 5 shared deletions. Long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed chromosome 19q13 deletion, which was subsequently found in one other family. The 32 kb deleted region harbors the CYP2A7 gene and was enriched with enhancer, repressor and insulator sites. The wildtype allele was lost in the polyps of the proband. Further, real-time RT-PCR assays showed that expressions of MIA and MIA-RAB4B located 35 kb upstream of the deletion, were up-regulated in the polyps compared to the matched mucosa of the proband. MIA-RAB4B, the read-through long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), RAB4B, PIM2 and TAOK1 share common binding site of a microRNA, miR-24, in their 3'UTRs. PIM2 and TAOK1, two target oncogenes of miR-24, were co-ordinately up-regulated with MIA-RAB4B in the polyps, suggesting that MIA-RAB4B could function as competitive endogenous RNA to titrate miR-24 away from its other targets. The data suggest that the 19.13 deletion disrupted chromatin boundary, leading to altered expression of several genes and lncRNA, could contribute to colorectal cancer via novel genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.	4
Detection of oncogenic mutations in resected bronchial margins by next-generation sequencing indicates early relapse in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients. || Adult Aged Bronchi Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Lung Neoplasms Male Margins of Excision Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Neoplasm Staging Neoplasm, Residual Oncogenes Outcome Assessment (Health Care) || Stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients experience a relatively high rate of recurrence, ranging from about 30-35%. We hypothesized that this elevated risk of recurrence is due to the presence of tumor cells at bronchial margins which was undetected by conventional light microscopy.Patients with clinical stage IA (T1N0M0) NSCLC were enrolled in this study,which included 8 early-relapse(ER) and 6 no-relapse(NR) patients. Primary tumor, bronchial margin,and normal lung tissues were collected and sent to a central site for targeted next-generation sequencing analysis. All of the patients were lung adenocarcinoma. Gene mutations were identified in all tumor tissue samples (100%).Oncogenic mutations were identified in 87.5%(7/8) bronchial margins of early relapse patients,whereas only 16.7%(1/6) no-relapse (NR) patient of marginal tissue had identified gene mutation.Additionally, concordance between primary tumor and bronchial margins was relatively high, with 4 of 8 (50%) ER patients having at least one identical mutation. Moreover, according to the gene mutation status in marginal tissue, 87.5% (7/8) of patients with at least one gene mutation in the bronchial margins had local recurrence or metastasis,whereas only 16.7% (1/6) of patients without any mutation detected had signs of relapse,the recurrence rate was significantly higher than that of the negative mutation margin group ((p (log-rank) = 0.023). The existence of oncogenic mutations in bronchial margins may represent occult residual tumor and elevated risk of recurrence in early stage NSCLC patients.Thus,assessing molecular status in bronchial margins may help identify patients who might benefit from extensive surgery or adjuvant treatment.	4
Long-Term Cochlear Implant Outcomes in Children with GJB2 and SLC26A4 Mutations. || Child Child, Preschool Cochlear Implants Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Demography Female Genotype Humans Language Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Speech Speech Intelligibility Speech Perception Sulfate Transporters Treatment Outcome || To investigate speech and language outcomes in children with cochlear implants (CIs) who had mutations in common deafness genes and to compare their performances with those without mutations. Prospective study. Patients who received CIs before 18 years of age and had used CIs for more than 3 years were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent mutation screening of three common deafness genes: GJB2, SLC26A4 and the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. The outcomes with CIs were assessed at post-implant years 3 and 5 using the Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) scale, Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) scale, speech perception tests and language skill tests. Forty-eight patients were found to have confirmative mutations in GJB2 or SLC26A4, and 123 without detected mutations were ascertained for comparison. Among children who received CIs before 3.5 years of age, patients with GJB2 or SLC26A4 mutations showed significantly higher CAP/SIR scores than those without mutations at post-implant year 3 (p = 0.001 for CAP; p = 0.004 for SIR) and year 5 (p = 0.035 for CAP; p = 0.038 for SIR). By contrast, among children who received CIs after age 3.5, no significant differences were noted in post-implant outcomes between patients with and without mutations (all p > 0.05). GJB2 and SLC26A4 mutations are associated with good post-implant outcomes. However, their effects on CI outcomes may be modulated by the age at implantation: the association between mutations and CI outcomes is observed in young recipients who received CIs before age 3.5 years but not in older recipients.	4
Targeted next generation sequencing of mucosal melanomas identifies frequent NF1 and RAS mutations. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Base Sequence Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mucous Membrane Mutation Neurofibromin 1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Mucosal melanoma represents ~1% of all melanomas, frequently having a poor prognosis due to diagnosis at a late stage of disease. Mucosal melanoma differs from cutaneous melanoma not only in terms of poorer clinical outcome but also on the molecular level having e.g. less BRAF and more frequent KIT mutations than cutaneous melanomas. For the majority of mucosal melanomas oncogenic driver mutations remain unknown. In our study, 75 tumor tissues from patients diagnosed with mucosal melanoma were analyzed, applying a targeted next generation sequencing panel covering 29 known recurrently mutated genes in melanoma. NF1 and RAS mutations were identified as the most frequently mutated genes occurring in 18.3% and 16.9% of samples, respectively. Mutations in BRAF were identified in 8.4% and KIT in 7.0% of tumor samples. Our study identifies NF1 as the most frequently occurring driver mutation in mucosal melanoma. RAS alterations, consisting of NRAS and KRAS mutations, were the second most frequent mutation type. BRAF and KIT mutations were rare with frequencies below 10% each. Our data indicate that in mucosal melanomas RAS/NF1 alterations are frequent, implying a significant pathogenetic role for MAPK and potentially PI3K pathway activation in these tumors.	4
Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma. || Aged Carcinoma DNA Methylation Female Gene Dosage Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genomics Humans MicroRNAs Middle Aged Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms RNA, Messenger || A catalogue of molecular aberrations that cause ovarian cancer is critical for developing and deploying therapies that will improve patients' lives. The Cancer Genome Atlas project has analysed messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, promoter methylation and DNA copy number in 489 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas and the DNA sequences of exons from coding genes in 316 of these tumours. Here we report that high-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by TP53 mutations in almost all tumours (96%); low prevalence but statistically recurrent somatic mutations in nine further genes including NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, RB1 and CDK12; 113 significant focal DNA copy number aberrations; and promoter methylation events involving 168 genes. Analyses delineated four ovarian cancer transcriptional subtypes, three microRNA subtypes, four promoter methylation subtypes and a transcriptional signature associated with survival duration, and shed new light on the impact that tumours with BRCA1/2 (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and CCNE1 aberrations have on survival. Pathway analyses suggested that homologous recombination is defective in about half of the tumours analysed, and that NOTCH and FOXM1 signalling are involved in serous ovarian cancer pathophysiology.	4
Raised intracranial pressure is frequent in untreated nonsyndromic unicoronal synostosis and does not correlate with severity of phenotypic features. ||  || In a small number of children with unicoronal synostosis, the phenotype is mild and the aesthetic benefit of surgical correction is potentially outweighed by surgical risk. Raised intracranial pressure, however, would necessitate intervention. The authors documented the incidence of raised intracranial pressure in children with mild features and/or parental reluctance to proceed directly to surgery. A retrospective review of all children with (1) a clinical diagnosis of nonsyndromic unicoronal synostosis; (2) unicoronal synostosis confirmed on computed tomographic scanning; (3) negative family history for unicoronal synostosis; and (4) negative genetic screening (including P250R encoded by FGFR3, exons IIIa and IIIc in FGFR2 and TWIST1) was completed. Of the 80 children studied, seven (9 percent) underwent formal intracranial pressure monitoring because of a combination of mild clinical features (n = 4) and/or parental reluctance to proceed with surgery (n = 3). Intracranial pressure monitoring was reported as high in three (42 percent), borderline in two (29 percent), and normal in two patients (29 percent). The findings did not correlate with the degree of clinical deformation or age at presentation. There was little correlation with clinical and radiographic features of raised intracranial pressure in this genetically screened nonsyndromic group. High or borderline raised intracranial pressure was present in five of seven cases. The risk did not correlate with degree of deformity or age at presentation. Formal intracranial pressure monitoring should be considered in all children with unicoronal synostosis not proceeding directly to surgical intervention, in combination with routine long-term follow-up and repeated intracranial pressure monitoring where indicated.

The spectrum of somatic mutations in high-risk acute myeloid leukaemia with -7/del(7q). || Chromosome Deletion Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7 Homeodomain Proteins Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Nuclear Proteins Repressor Proteins Risk Factors || -7/del(7q) occurs in half of myeloid malignancies with adverse-risk cytogenetic features and is associated with poor survival. We identified the spectrum of mutations that co-occur with -7/del(7q) in 40 patients with de novo or therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. -7/del(7q) leukaemias have a distinct mutational profile characterized by low frequencies of alterations in genes encoding transcription factors, cohesin and DNA-methylation-related proteins. In contrast, RAS pathway activating mutations occurred in 50% of cases, a significantly higher frequency than other acute myeloid leukaemias and higher than previously reported. Our data provide guidance for which pathways may be most relevant in the treatment of adverse-risk myeloid leukaemia.	4
BAP1 has a survival role in cutaneous melanoma. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins Melanocytes Melanoma Mice Mice, Inbred NOD Mice, SCID RNA, Messenger Skin Neoplasms Survivin Tumor Suppressor Proteins Ubiquitin Thiolesterase || Although the pattern of BAP1 inactivation in ocular melanoma specimens and in the BAP1 cutaneous melanoma (CM)/ocular melanoma predisposition syndrome suggests a tumor suppressor function, the specific role of this gene in the pathogenesis of CM is not fully understood. We thus set out to characterize BAP1 in CM and discovered an unexpected pro-survival effect of this protein. Tissue and cell lines analysis showed that BAP1 expression was maintained, rather than lost, in primary melanomas compared with nevi and normal skin. Genetic depletion of BAP1 in melanoma cells reduced proliferation and colony-forming capability, induced apoptosis, and inhibited melanoma tumor growth in vivo. On the molecular level, suppression of BAP1 led to a concomitant drop in the protein levels of survivin, a member of anti-apoptotic proteins and a known mediator of melanoma survival. Restoration of survivin in melanoma cells partially rescued the growth-retarding effects of BAP1 loss. In contrast to melanoma cells, stable overexpression of BAP1 into immortalized but non-transformed melanocytes did suppress proliferation and reduce survivin. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that BAP1 may have a growth-sustaining role in melanoma cells, but that its impact on ubiquitination underpins a complex physiology, which is context and cell dependent.	0

Presently in clinical trials, the small molecule Nutlin-3A competitively binds to HDM2 and abrogates its repressive function. Using a novel in vitro selection methodology, we simulated the emergence of resistance by evolving HDM2 mutants capable of binding p53 in the presence of Nutlin concentrations that inhibit the wild-type HDM2-p53 interaction. The in vitro phenotypes were recapitulated in ex vivo assays measuring both p53 transactivation function and the direct p53-HDM2 interaction in the presence of Nutlin. Mutations conferring drug resistance were not confined to the N-terminal p53/Nutlin-binding domain, and were additionally seen in the acidic, zinc finger and RING domains. Mechanistic insights gleaned from this broad spectrum of mutations will aid in future drug design and further our understanding of the complex p53-HDM2 interaction.	0
Mutant p53R248Q downregulates oxidative phosphorylation and upregulates glycolysis under normoxia and hypoxia in human cervix cancer cells. ||  || Mutations in p53 are strongly associated with several highly malignant cancer phenotypes but its role in regulating energy metabolism has not been completely elucidated. The effect on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) of mutant p53R248Q overexpression in HeLa cells (HeLa-M) was analyzed and compared with cells overexpressing wild-type p53 (HeLa-H) and nontransfected cells containing negligible p53 levels (HeLa-L). p53R248Q overexpression induced early cell detachment during in vitro growth; however, detached HeLa-M cells showed high viability, shorter generation time and significant diminution in the adhesion proteins E-cadherin and β-catenin versus HeLa-H and HeLa-L cells. Under normoxia, a lower growth rate of attached HeLa-M cells correlated with decreased levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitochondrial proteins (20-80%) and OxPhos flux (69 ± 12%). On the contrary, HeLa-M also showed increased contents of CDKN1A, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), c-MYC, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α; 1-4 times), glycolytic HIF-1α targets (2-4 times), and glycolysis flux (2-fold) versus HeLa-H. In consequence, glycolysis provided ~70% of the cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in HeLa-M cells under normoxia whereas, OxPhos predominated (65-82%) in HeLa-H and HeLa-L cells. Pifithrin-α, a specific p53 inhibitor, did not alter the p53R248Q target protein contents and OxPhos and glycolytic fluxes, and a poor HIF-1α-p53R248Q interaction was attained, in HeLa-M cells. These observations suggested that p53R248Q deficiently interacted with pifithrin-α and HIF-1α. Therefore, lower mitochondrial biogenesis, deficient HIF-1α/mutant p53 interaction, and development of a pseudohypoxic state under normoxia were the apparent biochemical mechanisms underlying glycolysis activation and OxPhos downregulation in HeLa-M cells.	0
Tumor RAS Gene Expression Levels Are Influenced by the Mutational Status of RAS Genes and Both Upstream and Downstream RAS Pathway Genes. ||  || The 3 human RAS genes play pivotal roles regulating proliferation, differentiation, and survival in normal cells and become mutated in 15% to 20% of all human tumors and amplified in many others. In this report, we examined data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to investigate the relationship between RAS gene mutational status and messenger RNA expression. We show that all 3 RAS genes exhibit increased expression when they are mutated in a context-dependent manner. In the case of KRAS, this increase is manifested by a larger proportional increase inKRAS4A thanKRAS4B, although both increase significantly. In addition, the mutational status of RAS genes can be associated with expression changes in other RAS genes, with most of these cases showing decreased expression. The mutational status associations with expression are recapitulated in cancer cell lines. Increases in expression are mediated by both copy number variation and contextual differences, including mutational status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) andBRAF. These findings potentially reveal an adaptive response during tumor evolution that is dependent on the mutational status of proximal genes in the RAS pathway and cellular context. Cell contextual differences in these adaptations may influence therapeutic responsiveness and alternative resistance mechanisms.	0
Establishment of a Gene Detection System for Hotspot Mutations of Hearing Loss. || China Female Genetic Testing Hearing Loss Humans Incidence Male Mutation Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction || Hearing loss is an etiologically heterogeneous trait with a high incidence in China. Though conventional newborn hearing screening program has been widely adopted, gene detection can significantly improve the means of early discovering genetic risk factors. Thus, simple and efficient methods with higher sensitivity and lower cost for detecting hotspot mutations of hearing loss are urgently requested. Here we established a mutation detection system based on multiple fluorescent probe technique, which can detect and genotype nine hotspot mutations of four prominent hearing loss-related genes in two reactions on a four-channel real-time PCR instrument, including GJB2 (rs750188782, rs80338943, rs1110333204, and rs80338939),GJB3 (rs74315319),SLC26A4 (rs111033313 and rs121908362), andmtDNA 12S rRNA (rs267606617 and rs267606619). This system is with high sensitivity that enables detecting as low as 10 DNA copies samples per reaction. A comparison study in 268 clinical samples showed that the detection system had 100% concordance to Sanger sequencing. Besides, blood and saliva samples can be directly detected without DNA extraction process, which greatly simplifies the manipulation. The new system with high sensitivity, accuracy, and specimen type compatibility can be expectedly a reliable tool in clinical application.	4
Treating p53 Mutant Aggregation-Associated Cancer. ||  || p53 is a tumor suppressor protein. Under stressful conditions, p53 tightly regulates cell growth by promoting apoptosis and DNA repair. When p53 becomes mutated, it loses its function, resulting in abnormal cell proliferation and tumor progression. Depending on the p53 mutation, it has been shown to form aggregates leading to negative gain of function of the protein. p53 mutant associated aggregation has been observed in several cancer tissues and has been shown to promote tumor growth. Recent studies show correlation between p53 mutant aggregation, functional loss, and tumor growth. Moreover, p53 aggregation has been observed in biopsies, patient tissues, and in vivo studies. Given the fact that over fifty percent of cancers have p53 mutation and several of them are prone to aggregation, therapeutic strategies are needed for treating p53 mutant aggregation associated cancers. Recent studies using polyarginine analogues and designer peptides for inhibiting p53 aggregation and tumor growth gives further encouragement in treating cancer as a protein aggregation disease. In this review, we highlight the recent efforts in targeting p53 aggregation in cancer and propose the use of small stress molecules as potential p53-antiaggregation drugs.	0
Identification of a missense phenylketonuria mutation at codon 408 in Chinese. || Alleles Base Sequence Blotting, Southern China Codon Gene Amplification Haplotypes Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Nucleic Acid Hybridization Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || A single base transition of G to A at codon 408 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene is identified. This missense mutation results in the substitution of Arg408 for Gln408 (R408Q) and accounts for about 5% of phenylketonuria (PKU) chromosomes among Chinese. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4. In addition, another mutation (R408W), at the same codon and prevalent on haplotype 2 PKU chromosomes in Caucasians, is identified in a PKU allele of haplotype 41. Previously, this mutation has been observed on a haplotype 44 background in Chinese PKU patients.	3
Prevalence of mitochondrial DNA mutations in sporadic patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool DNA, Mitochondrial Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Prevalence RNA, Ribosomal Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || Several mitochondrial DNA mutations have been reported to be associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss in several families. However, little is known about the prevalence of these mutations in sporadic patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The purpose of our study was to investigate the incidence of these mitochondrial DNA mutations in such population. A total of 178 sporadic patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood sample. We employed the SNaPshot(®) sequencing method to detect five mitochondrial DNA mutations, including A1555G and A827G in 12S rRNA gene and A7445G, 7472insC, and T7511C in tRNA(Ser(UCN)) gene. Meanwhile, we used polymerase chain reaction and sequenced the products to screen GJB2 gene mutations in patients carrying mitochondrial DNA mutations. We failed to detect the presence of A1555G mutation in 12S rRNA gene, and of A7445G, 7472insC, T7511C mutations in tRNA(Ser(UCN)) gene in our population. However, we found that 6 patients (3.37%) were carriers of a homozygous A827G mutation and one of them also carried homozygous GJB2 235delC mutation. Our findings in the present study indicate that even in sporadic patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, mitochondrial DNA mutations might also contribute to the clinical phenotype.	4
A SDHC Founder Mutation Causes Paragangliomas (PGLs) in the French Canadians: New Insights on the SDHC-Related PGL. ||  || More than 40% of patients with paragangliomas (PGLs) harbor a germline mutation of the known PGL susceptibility genes, mainly in the SDHB or SDHD genes. The objective of the study was to characterize the genetic background of the French Canadian (FC) patients with PGLs and provide new clinical and paraclinical insights on SDHC-related PGLs. Genetic testing has been offered to FC patients affected with PGLs followed up at the adrenal genetics clinic at Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal. After genetic counseling, 29 FC patients consented for PGL genetic testing. Thirteen of 29 patients (44.8%) carried a germline mutation. The same heterozygous nonsense mutation at codon 133 of exon 5 of the SDHC gene (c.397C>T, p.[Arg133Ter]) was found in nine patients, representing 69.2% of the patients having a germline mutation. Seventy percent of these patients had head and neck PGLs. Twenty percent had multiple and 30% had malignant PGLs. We traced back the ascending genealogy of 10 index cases (nine patients from our cohort and one patient referred to us) and found that this mutation was most probably introduced in Nouvelle France by a couple of French settlers who established themselves in the 17th century. We found that 31% of the PGLs in the French Canadian can be explained by the SDHC mutation (c.397C>T, p.[Arg133Ter]). The dominance of the SDHC mutation is unique to the FCs and is most likely due to a French founder effect. SDHC gene analysis should be prioritized in FC patients with PGL.	4
Ethnicity and mutations in GJB2 (connexin 26) and GJB6 (connexin 30) in a multi-cultural Canadian paediatric Cochlear Implant Program. || Canada Child Cochlear Implantation Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Cultural Diversity DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Ethnic Groups Gene Deletion Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Mutation, Missense Point Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Program Development || To determine the relationship between ethnicity and mutations in the GJB2 and GJB6 genes in multi-cultural patients enrolled in a Canadian paediatric Cochlear Implant Program. Blood was analyzed from 65 paediatric cochlear implant users by direct sequencing of the coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the GBJ2 gene. Individuals heterozygous for one mutation in GJB2 or in whom mutations in GJB2 were not detected were analyzed for the common 342 kb deletion mutation D13S1830 in the GJB6 gene. Information regarding ethnicity of patients' families was obtained from patient records and/or interview. GJB2 mutations were found in 36.9% of paediatric cochlear implant users tested. Nine different GJB2 mutations were identified among individuals from 14 different countries of origin. Seventy-eight percent of all identified pathogenic GJB2 mutations were 35delG. Biallelic GJB2 mutations were found in 16 cochlear implant users (66.7% of GJB2 mutations). Three novel GJB2 sequence changes were identified: (1) a missense mutation T107C (L36P) in an individual of African decent; (2) a missense mutation G475T (D159Y) in an individual of Caribbean decent; (3) a regulatory region change 1-34C to T in an individual of African decent. GJB6-D13S1830 mutations were not found in any of the patients tested. Individuals of African, Caribbean and East Indian decent had different GJB2 mutations than the remainder of individuals tested. Patients of Asian, Italian, Spanish, Polish and Armenian decent were not found to carry mutations in GJB2 or the common GJB6-D13S1830 mutation. This study represents the largest number of biallelic GJB2 mutations isolated in a group of paediatric cochlear implant users to date. Numerous and diverse GJB2 mutations were found in this multi-cultural group of children. Even though GJB2 mutations have been widely reported in the literature, this discussion represents the first report of GJB2 mutations in a multi-ethnic population (Canadian), as compared with previous studies that investigated fairly homogeneous populations. The diversity of GJB2 mutations identified reinforces the importance of testing for changes in GJB2 by direct sequencing of the entire coding region rather than testing only for common mutations.	4
[Connexin gene 26 (GJB2) mutations in patients with hereditary non-syndromic sensorineural loss of hearing in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)]. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Prevalence Siberia Young Adult || The aim of the study was to elucidate the causes of hereditary non-syndromic loss of hearing, a frequent monogene pathology in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). A search for mutations in the coding sequence of the connexin 26 gene gap-junction B2 (GJB2) was undertaken in 79 members of 65 unrelated families with the diagnosis of grade III-IV non-syndromic bilateral sensorineural loss of hearing. Five recessive mutations (35delG, V371, 312-326del14, 333-334delAA, R127H) and three polymorphic variants (V271, M34T, E114G) were identified in Yakut patients. Mutations 35delG (41.7%), 312-326dell4 (4.2%), and 333-334delAA (4.2%) were found in Caucasian patients (Russians, Ukrainians, Inguish). Yakuts were carriers of mutations 35delG (2.1%), V371 (2.1%), R127H (1.0%) and sequence variants V271 (6.3%), M34T (1.0%), E114G (1.0%). GJB2 mutations were identified in 50.1% of the Caucasian patients and in 7.2% of the Yakut patients. The low frequency of GJB2 mutations in Yakuts with non-syndromic sensorineural loss of hearing testifies to the presence of mutations of other genes controlling sound perception in this population.	4
PKM2 Subcellular Localization Is Involved in Oxaliplatin Resistance Acquisition in HT29 Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Lines. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis Carrier Proteins Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus Cell Survival Colorectal Neoplasms Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockdown Techniques Gene Silencing HCT116 Cells HT29 Cells Humans Membrane Proteins Organoplatinum Compounds Oxaliplatin Protein Transport Subcellular Fractions Thyroid Hormones Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Chemoresistance is the main cause of treatment failure in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain to be elucidated. In a previous work we identified low levels of PKM2 as a putative oxaliplatin-resistance marker in HT29 CRC cell lines and also in patients. In order to assess how PKM2 influences oxaliplatin response in CRC cells, we silenced PKM2 using specific siRNAs in HT29, SW480 and HCT116 cells. MTT test demonstrated that PKM2 silencing induced resistance in HT29 and SW480 cells and sensitivity in HCT116 cells. Same experiments in isogenic HCT116 p53 null cells and double silencing of p53 and PKM2 in HT29 cells failed to show an influence of p53. By using trypan blue stain and FITC-Annexin V/PI tests we detected that PKM2 knockdown was associated with an increase in cell viability but not with a decrease in apoptosis activation in HT29 cells. Fluorescence microscopy revealed PKM2 nuclear translocation in response to oxaliplatin in HCT116 and HT29 cells but not in OXA-resistant HTOXAR3 cells. Finally, by using a qPCR Array we demonstrated that oxaliplatin and PKM2 silencing altered cell death gene expression patterns including those of BMF, which was significantly increased in HT29 cells in response to oxaliplatin, in a dose and time-dependent manner, but not in siPKM2-HT29 and HTOXAR3 cells. BMF gene silencing in HT29 cells lead to a decrease in oxaliplatin-induced cell death. In conclusion, our data report new non-glycolytic roles of PKM2 in response to genotoxic damage and proposes BMF as a possible target gene of PKM2 to be involved in oxaliplatin response and resistance in CRC cells.	0
An in silico algorithm for identifying stabilizing pockets in proteins: test case, the Y220C mutant of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. || Algorithms Computer Simulation DNA Ligands Molecular Docking Simulation Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Protein Domains Protein Stability Temperature Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 tumor suppressor protein performs a critical role in stimulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in response to oncogenic stress. The function of p53 can be compromised by mutation, leading to increased risk of cancer; approximately 50% of cancers are associated with mutations in the p53 gene, the majority of which are in the core DNA-binding domain. The Y220C mutation of p53, for example, destabilizes the core domain by 4 kcal/mol, leading to rapid denaturation and aggregation. The associated loss of tumor suppressor functionality is associated with approximately 75 000 new cancer cases every year. Destabilized p53 mutants can be 'rescued' and their function restored; binding of a small molecule into a pocket on the surface of mutant p53 can stabilize its wild-type structure and restore its function. Here, we describe an in silico algorithm for identifying potential rescue pockets, including the algorithm's integration with the Dynameomics molecular dynamics data warehouse and the DIVE visual analytics engine. We discuss the results of the application of the method to the Y220C p53 mutant, entailing finding a putative rescue pocket through MD simulations followed by an in silico search for stabilizing ligands that dock into the putative rescue pocket. The top three compounds from this search were tested experimentally and one of them bound in the pocket, as shown by nuclear magnetic resonance, and weakly stabilized the mutant.	0
[Frequencies of 6 known mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and their application in prenatal gene diagnosis]. ||  || The known mutant alleles of human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene were analyzed in 25 phenylketonuria (PKU) families from North China by polymerase chain reaction combined with allele-specific oligonucleotide dot hybridization techniques. The results showed that the six mutation accounted for 62% of all PKU genes. The three most frequent mutations were Arg243-->Gln in exon 7, Arg413-->Pro in exon 12 and Tyr204-->Cys in exon 6. They accounted for 24%, 18% and 16% respectively of all PKU alleles. The frequencies of Arg111-->Ter mutation in exon 3, Tyr356-->Ter mutation in exon 11 and Trp326-->Ter mutation in exon 10 were somewhat lower in North China. They accounted for 4% of all PKU alleles. Among these 25 PKU families, prenatal gene diagnosis was possible in 10 families. In 11 families, 50% exclusive diagnosis was possible. Prenatal gene diagnosis was performed and confirmed in 2 families.	3
The p53 transcriptional pathway is preserved in ATMmutated and NOTCH1mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemias. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins Base Sequence Female Genes, p53 Humans Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell Male Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Receptor, Notch1 Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || By using next generation sequencing, we have analyzed 108 B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. Among genes involved in the TP53 pathway, we found frequent mutations in ATM (n=18), TP53 (n=10) and NOTCH1 (n=10) genes, rare mutations of NOTCH2 (n=2) and CDKN1A/p21 (n=1) and no mutations in BAX, MDM2, TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B genes. The in vitro treatment of primary B-CLL cells with the activator of p53 Nutlin-3 induced the transcription of p53 target genes, without significant differences between the B-CLL without mutations and those harboring either ATM or NOTCH1mutations. On the other hand, the subgroup of TP53mutated B-CLL exhibited a significantly lower induction of the p53 target genes in response to Nutlin-3 as compared to the other B-CLL samples. However, among the TP53mutated B-CLL, those showing mutations in the high hot spot region of the DNA binding domain [273-280 aa] maintained a significantly higher p53-dependent transcriptional activity as compared to the other TP53mutated B-CLL samples. Since the ability to elicit a p53-dependent transcriptional activity in vitro has a positive prognostic significance, our data suggest that ATMmutated, NOTCH1mutated and surprisingly, also a subset of TP53mutated B-CLL patients might benefit from therapeutic combinations including small molecule activator of the p53 pathway.	0
Phenotypic Similarities Between Late-Onset Autosomal Dominant and Sporadic Alzheimer Disease: A Single-Family Case-Control Study. || Age of Onset Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease Case-Control Studies Disease Progression Family Health Female Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Mutation Presenilin-1 || The amyloid hypothesis posits that disrupted β-amyloid homeostasis initiates the pathological process resulting in Alzheimer disease (AD). Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) has an early symptomatic onset and is caused by single-gene mutations that result in overproduction of β-amyloid 42. To the extent that sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD) also results from dysregulated β-amyloid 42, the clinical phenotypes of ADAD and LOAD should be similar when controlling for the effects of age. To use a family with late-onset ADAD caused by a presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene mutation to mitigate the potential confound of age when comparing ADAD and LOAD. This case-control study was conducted at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, and other National Institutes of Aging-funded AD centers in the United States. Ten PSEN1 A79V mutation carriers from multiple generations of a family with late-onset ADAD and 12 noncarrier family members were followed up at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (1985-2015) and 1115 individuals with neuropathologically confirmed LOAD were included from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center database (September 2005-December 2014). Data analysis was completed in January 2016, including Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center patient data collected up until the end of 2015. Planned comparison of clinical characteristics between cohorts, including age at symptom onset, associated symptoms and signs, rates of progression, and disease duration. Of the PSEN1 A79V carriers in the family with late-onset ADAD, 4 were female (57%); among those with LOAD, 529 were female (47%). Seven mutation carriers (70%) developed AD dementia, while 3 were yet asymptomatic in their seventh and eighth decades of life. No differences were observed between mutation carriers and individuals with LOAD concerning age at symptom onset (mutation carriers: mean, 75 years [range, 63-77 years] vs those with LOAD: mean, 74 years [range, 60-101 years]; P = .29), presenting symptoms (memory loss in 7 of 7 mutation carriers [100%] vs 958 of 1063 individuals with LOAD [90.1%]; P ≥ .99) and duration (mutation carriers: mean, 9.9 years [range, 2.3-12.8 years] vs those with LOAD: 9 years [range, 1-27 years]; P = .73), and rate of progression of dementia (median annualized change in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes score, mutation carriers: 1.2 [range, 0.1-3.3] vs those with LOAD: 1.9 [range, -3.5 to 11.9]; P = .73). Early emergence of comorbid hallucinations and delusions were observed in 57% of individuals with ADAD (4 of 7) vs 19% of individuals with LOAD (137 of 706) (P = .03). Three of 12 noncarriers (25%) from the PSEN1 A79V family are potential phenocopies as they also developed AD dementia (median age at onset, 76.0 years). In this family, the amyloidogenic PSEN1 A79V mutation recapitulates the clinical attributes of LOAD. Previously reported clinical phenotypic differences between individuals with ADAD and LOAD may reflect age- or mutation-dependent effects.	4
[Analysis of GJB2 gene and mitochondrial DNA A1555G mutations in 16 families with non-syndromic hearing loss]. ||  || To screen for genetic mutations in families featuring non-syndromic hearing loss. Sixteen families with non-syndromic hearing loss were interviewed to identify medical histories by a questionnaire. Audiological and neurological examinations were conducted for all families. Coding regions of GJB2 and 12S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced. Of the 17 patients with sensorineural hearing loss, 3 were homozygous mutation for GJB2 235 delC, 1 was 235 delC heterozygous mutation, 1 was 235 delC+299_300 delAT compound heterozygous mutation, and 6 were 79G>A+341G>A heterozygosis in cis mutation. No 1555A>G mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was found in the 16 families. The incidence of mtDNA 12S rRNA 1555A>G mutation in Jiangsu province may be lower than the average across China. Mutations of GJB2 genes may account for as much as 64.7% of non-syndromic hearing loss in this study. Screening for such mutations and genetic counseling may play an important role in the prevention of hereditary hearing loss.	4
Lack of SF3B1 R625 mutations in cutaneous melanoma. || Base Sequence Exons Female Genes, ras Humans Male Melanoma Mutation Phosphoproteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf RNA Splicing Factors Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear Skin Skin Neoplasms Uveal Neoplasms || Melanoma is a deadly disease affecting people worldwide. Genetic studies have identified different melanoma subtypes characterized by specific recurrently mutated genes and led to the successful clinical introduction of targeted therapies. Hotspot mutations in SF3B1 were recently reported in uveal melanoma. Our aim was to see if these mutations also occur in cutaneous melanoma. We analyzed a cohort of 85 cutaneous melanoma including 22 superficial spreading, 24 acral-lentiginous, 36 nodular, and 3 lentigo-maligna melanomas. Exon 14 of SF3B1, containing the site of recurrent mutations described in uveal melanoma, was sequenced in all samples. Additionally, NRAS exon 1 and 2 and BRAF exon 15 were sequenced in all, KIT exons 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18 in 30 samples. High numbers of BRAF and NRAS mutations were identified with frequencies varying according to melanoma subtype. None of the samples were found to harbor a SF3B1 mutation. We conclude that recurrent mutations in codon 625 of SF3B1 as reported in uveal melanoma are not present in most types of cutaneous melanoma. This highlights the genetic differences between cutaneous and uveal melanoma and the need for subtype specific therapeutic approaches.	4
Citreoviridin Induces Autophagy-Dependent Apoptosis through Lysosomal-Mitochondrial Axis in Human Liver HepG2 Cells. || apoptosis autophagy citreoviridin human liver HepG2 cells lysosomal membrane permeabilization || Citreoviridin (CIT) is a mycotoxin derived from fungal species in moldy cereals. In our previous study, we reported that CIT stimulated autophagosome formation in human liver HepG2 cells. Here, we aimed to explore the relationship of autophagy with lysosomal membrane permeabilization and apoptosis in CIT-treated cells. Our data showed that CIT increased the expression of LC3-II, an autophagosome biomarker, from the early stage of treatment (6 h). After treatment with CIT for 12 h, lysosomal membrane permeabilization occurred, followed by the release of cathepsin D in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of autophagosome formation with siRNA against Atg5 attenuated CIT-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization. In addition, CIT induced collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential as assessed by JC-1 staining. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity assay showed that CIT induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of autophagosome formation attenuated CIT-induced apoptosis, indicating that CIT-induced apoptosis was autophagy-dependent. Cathepsin D inhibitor, pepstatin A, relieved CIT-induced apoptosis as well, suggesting the involvement of the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis in CIT-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that CIT induced autophagy-dependent apoptosis through the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis in HepG2 cells. The study thus provides essential mechanistic insight, and suggests clues for the effective management and treatment of CIT-related diseases.	0

We studied primary prostate tumors with MMR defects.Experimental Design: A total of 1,133 primary prostatic adenocarcinomas and 43 prostatic small cell carcinomas (NEPC) were screened by MSH2 immunohistochemistry with confirmation by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Microsatellite instability (MSI) was assessed by PCR and NGS (mSINGS).Results: Of primary adenocarcinomas and NEPC, 1.2% (14/1,176) had MSH2 loss. Overall, 8% (7/91) of adenocarcinomas with primary Gleason pattern 5 (Gleason score 9-10) had MSH2 loss compared with 0.4% (5/1,042) of tumors with any other scores (P < 0.05). Five percent (2/43) of NEPC had MSH2 loss. MSH2 was generally homogenously lost, suggesting it was an early/clonal event. NGS confirmedMSH2 loss-of-function alterations in all (12/12) samples, with biallelic inactivation in 83% (10/12) and hypermutation in 83% (10/12). Overall, 61% (8/13) and 58% (7/12) of patients had definite MSI by PCR and mSINGS, respectively. Three patients (25%) had germline mutations inMSH2 Tumors with MSH2 loss had a higher density of infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes compared with grade-matched controls without MSH2 loss (390 vs. 76 cells/mm2;P = 0.008), and CD8+ density was correlated with mutation burden among cases with MSH2 loss (r = 0.72,P = 0.005). T-cell receptor sequencing on a subset revealed a trend toward higher clonality in cases versus controls.Conclusions: Loss of MSH2 protein is correlated withMSH2 inactivation, hypermutation, and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte density, and appears most common among very high-grade primary tumors, for which routine screening may be warranted if validated in additional cohorts.Clin Cancer Res; 23(22); 6863-74. ©2017 AACR.	4
Sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor E6201 in melanoma cells is associated with mutant BRAF and wildtype PTEN status. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Cell Survival Chromones Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Humans Lactones MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases Melanoma Mice Mice, Nude Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Morpholines Mutation PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, but recent advances in molecularly targeted agents against the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway demonstrate promise as effective therapies. Despite these advances, resistance remains an issue, as illustrated recently by the clinical experience with vemurafenib. Such acquired resistance appears to be the result of parallel pathway activation, such as PI3K, to overcome single-agent inhibition. In this report, we describe the cytotoxicity and anti-tumour activity of the novel MEK inhibitor, E6201, in a broad panel of melanoma cell lines (n = 31) of known mutational profile in vitro and in vivo. We further test the effectiveness of combining E6201 with an inhibitor of PI3K (LY294002) in overcoming resistance in these cell lines. The majority of melanoma cell lines were either sensitive (IC50 < 500 nM, 24/31) or hypersensitive (IC50 < 100 nM, 18/31) to E6201. This sensitivity correlated with wildtype PTEN and mutant BRAF status, whereas mutant RAS and PI3K pathway activation were associated with resistance. Although MEK inhibitors predominantly exert a cytostatic effect, E6201 elicited a potent cytocidal effect on most of the sensitive lines studied, as evidenced by Annexin positivity and cell death ELISA. Conversely, E6201 did not induce cell death in the two resistant melanoma cell lines tested. E6201 inhibited xenograft tumour growth in all four melanoma cell lines studied to varying degrees, but a more pronounced anti-tumour effect was observed for cell lines that previously demonstrated a cytocidal response in vitro. In vitro combination studies of E6201 and LY294002 showed synergism in all six melanoma cell lines tested, as defined by a mean combination index < 1. Our data demonstrate that E6201 elicits a predominantly cytocidal effect in vitro and in vivo in melanoma cells of diverse mutational background. Resistance to E6201 was associated with disruption of PTEN and activation of downstream PI3K signalling. In keeping with these data we demonstrate that co-inhibition of MAPK and PI3K is effective in overcoming resistance inherent in melanoma.	0
Control of Nucleotide Metabolism Enables Mutant p53's Oncogenic Gain-of-Function Activity. || Animals Gain of Function Mutation Humans Nucleotides Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Since its discovery as an oncoprotein in 1979, investigation into p53's many identities has completed a full circle and today it is inarguably the most extensively studied tumor suppressor (wild-type p53 form or WTp53) and oncogene (mutant p53 form or mtp53) in cancer research. After the p53 protein was declared "Molecule of the Year" by Science in 1993, the p53 field exploded and a plethora of excellent reviews is now available on every aspect of p53 genetics and functional repertoire in a cell. Nevertheless, new functions of p53 continue to emerge. Here, we discuss a novel mechanism that contributes to mtp53's Gain of Functions GOF (gain-of-function) activities and involves the upregulation of both nucleotide de novo synthesis and nucleoside salvage pathways.	0
CDK8/19 inhibition induces premature G1/S transition and ATR-dependent cell death in prostate cancer cells. ||  || The CDK8/19 kinase module comprises a subcomplex that interacts with the Mediator complex and regulates gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors and Mediator subunits. Mediator complex subunits have been increasingly implicated in cancer and other diseases. Although high expression of CDK8/19 has been demonstrated in prostate cancer, its function has not been thoroughly examined. Here we report that CDK8/19 modulates the gene expression of cell cycle regulators and thereby maintains the proper G1/S transition in prostate cancer cells. We show that highly selective CDK8/19 inhibitors exerted anti-proliferative activity in prostate cancer cells both in vitro andin vivo. In CDK8/19 inhibitor-sensitive prostate cancer cells, the compounds reduced the population of G1 phase cells and elevated that of S phase cells through the modulation of G1/S transition regulators at the level of mRNA expression. Furthermore, the premature G1/S transition induced a DNA damage response that was followed by ATR-dependent and caspase-independent cell death. These findings suggest a novel role of CDK8/19 in transcription-mediated cell cycle control, albeit with possible contribution of other proteins inhibited by the compounds. Our data provide a rationale for further investigation of CDK8/19 inhibitors as a new therapeutic approach to prostate cancer.	0
Electroporated Antigen-Encoding mRNA Is Not a Danger Signal to Human Mature Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells. || Cancer Vaccines Cell Differentiation Cells, Cultured Cytokines Dendritic Cells Electroporation Gene Expression Profiling Humans Immunotherapy, Adoptive MART-1 Antigen Microarray Analysis Monocytes RNA, Messenger || For therapeutic cancer vaccination, the adoptive transfer of mRNA-electroporated dendritic cells (DCs) is frequently performed, usually with monocyte-derived, cytokine-matured DCs (moDCs). However, DCs are rich in danger-sensing receptors which could recognize the exogenously delivered mRNA and induce DC activation, hence influencing the DCs' immunogenicity. Therefore, we examined whether electroporation of mRNA with a proper cap and a poly-A tail of at least 64 adenosines had any influence on cocktail-matured moDCs. We used 16 different RNAs, encoding tumor antigens (MelanA, NRAS, BRAF, GNAQ, GNA11, and WT1), and variants thereof. None of those RNAs induced changes in the expression of CD25, CD40, CD83, CD86, and CD70 or the secretion of the cytokines IL-8, IL-6, and TNFα of more than 1.5-fold compared to the control condition, while an mRNA encoding an NF-κB-activation protein as positive control induced massive secretion of the cytokines. To determine whether mRNA electroporation had any effect on the whole transcriptome of the DCs, we performed microarray analyses of DCs of 6 different donors. None of 60,000 probes was significantly different between mock-electroporated DCs and MelanA-transfected DCs. Hence, we conclude that no transcriptional programs were induced within cocktail-matured DCs by electroporation of single tumor-antigen-encoding mRNAs.	0
Creation of Novel Protein Variants with CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Mutagenesis: Turning a Screening By-Product into a Discovery Tool. || Alleles CRISPR-Cas Systems Cell Line, Tumor Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats DNA End-Joining Repair Gene Library HEK293 Cells Humans INDEL Mutation Indoles MAP Kinase Kinase 1 Mutagenesis Phenotype Protein Engineering Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf RNA, Guide Recombinant Fusion Proteins Sequence Alignment Sulfonamides Transduction, Genetic Vemurafenib || CRISPR/Cas9 screening has proven to be a versatile tool for genomics research. Based on unexpected results from a genome-wide screen, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated approach to mutagenesis, exploiting the allelic diversity generated by error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) to identify novel gain-of-function and drug resistant alleles of the MAPK signaling pathway genes MEK1 and BRAF. We define the parameters of a scalable technique to easily generate cell populations containing thousands of endogenous allelic variants to map gene functions. Further, these results highlight an unexpected but important phenomenon, that Cas9-induced gain-of-function alleles are an inherent by-product of normal Cas9 loss-of-function screens and should be investigated during analysis of data from large-scale positive selection screens.	0
Mutant p53 enhances MET trafficking and signalling to drive cell scattering and invasion. || Animals Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Movement Colonic Neoplasms HCT116 Cells HT29 Cells Humans Lung Neoplasms Mice Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met Signal Transduction Transcription Factors Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Tumour-derived mutant p53 proteins promote invasion, in part, by enhancing Rab coupling protein (RCP)-dependent receptor recycling. Here we identified MET as an RCP-binding protein and showed that mutant p53 promoted MET recycling. Mutant p53-expressing cells were more sensitive to hepatocyte growth factor, the ligand for MET, leading to enhanced MET signalling, invasion and cell scattering that was dependent on both MET and RCP. In cells expressing the p53 family member TAp63, inhibition of TAp63 also lead to cell scattering and MET-dependent invasion. However, in cells that express very low levels of TAp63, the ability of mutant p53 to promote MET-dependent cell scattering was independent of TAp63. Taken together, our data show that mutant p53 can enhance MET signalling to promote cell scattering and invasion through both TAp63-dependent and -independent mechanisms. MET has a predominant role in metastatic progression and the identification of mechanisms through which mutations in p53 can drive MET signalling may help to identify and direct therapy.	0
Haplotype analysis of TP53 polymorphisms, Arg72Pro and Ins16, in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers of French Canadian descent. || Adult Canada Female Founder Effect France Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genes, p53 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Haplotypes Heterozygote Humans Middle Aged Polymorphism, Genetic || The TP53 polymorphisms Arg72Pro (Ex4+199 G>C) and Ins16 (IVS3+24 ins16) have been proposed to modify risk of breast cancer associated with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Allele frequencies of these polymorphisms were investigated to determine if they modify risk in BRCA mutation carriers in breast cancer cases drawn from French Canadian cancer families, a population shown to exhibit strong founder effects. The frequencies of the TP53 alleles, genotypes and haplotypes of 157 index breast cancer cases comprised of 42 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 57 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 58 BRCA mutation-negative cases, where each case was drawn from independently ascertained families were compared. The effect of TP53 variants on the age of diagnosis was also investigated for these groups. The TP53 polymorphisms were also investigated in 112 women of French Canadian descent with no personal history of cancer. The BRCA mutation-positive groups had the highest frequency of homozygous carriers of the 72Pro allele compared with mutation-negative group. The TP53 polymorphisms exhibited linkage disequilibrium (p < 0.001), where the 72Arg and Ins16minus alleles occurred in strong disequilibrium. The highest frequency of carriers of Ins16minus-72Arg haplotype occurred in the BRCA mutation-negative groups. The BRCA1 mutation carriers homozygous for the 72Pro allele had the youngest ages of diagnosis of breast cancer. However none of these observations were statistically significant. In contrast, the BRCA2 mutation carriers homozygous for the 72Pro allele had a significantly older age of diagnosis of breast cancer (p = 0.018). Moreover, in this group, the mean age of diagnosis of breast cancer in carriers of the Ins16minus-72Arg haplotype was significantly younger than that of the individuals who did not this carry this haplotype (p = 0.009). We observed no significant association of breast cancer risk with TP53 genetic variants based on BRCA1/2 mutation carrier status. Although the small sample size did not permit analysis of all possible haplotypes, we observed that BRCA2 mutation carriers harboring the Ins16minus-72Arg haplotype had a significantly younger mean age of diagnosis of breast cancer. These observations suggest that investigations in a larger French Canadian sample are warranted to further elucidate the effects of TP53 variants on age of diagnosis of breast cancer among BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.	4
Driver mutations in TP53 are ubiquitous in high grade serous carcinoma of the ovary. || Adult Aged Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous DNA, Neoplasm Disease Progression Exons Female Genes, p53 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Ovarian Neoplasms Pilot Projects Prognosis Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome Young Adult || Numerous studies have tested the association between TP53 mutations in ovarian cancer and prognosis but these have been consistently confounded by limitations in study design, methodology, and/or heterogeneity in the sample cohort. High-grade serous (HGS) carcinoma is the most clinically important histological subtype of ovarian cancer. As these tumours may arise from the ovary, Fallopian tube or peritoneum, they are collectively referred to as high-grade pelvic serous carcinoma (HGPSC). To identify the true prevalence of TP53 mutations in HGPSC, we sequenced exons 2-11 and intron-exon boundaries in tumour DNA from 145 patients. HGPSC cases were defined as having histological grade 2 or 3 and FIGO stage III or IV. Surprisingly, pathogenic TP53 mutations were identified in 96.7% (n = 119/123) of HGPSC cases. Molecular and pathological review of mutation-negative cases showed evidence of p53 dysfunction associated with copy number gain of MDM2 or MDM4, or indicated the exclusion of samples as being low-grade serous tumours or carcinoma of uncertain primary site. Overall, p53 dysfunction rate approached 100% of confirmed HGPSCs. No association between TP53 mutation and progression-free or overall survival was found. From this first comprehensive mapping of TP53 mutation rate in a homogeneous group of HGPSC patients, we conclude that mutant TP53 is a driver mutation in the pathogenesis of HGPSC cancers. Because TP53 mutation is almost invariably present in HGPSC, it is not of substantial prognostic or predictive significance.	4

A lethal course of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Noonan syndrome due to a novel germline mutation in the KRAS gene: case study. || Animals Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Exons Fatal Outcome Female Germ-Line Mutation Humans Infant Male Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || Noonan syndrome is a relatively common and heterogeneous genetic disorder, including congenital heart defect in more than half of the cases. If the defect is not large, life expectancy is normal. Here we report on a case of an infant with Noonan syndrome and rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with lethal outcome, in whom we identified a novel mutation in the KRAS gene. This heterozygous unclassified missense variant in exon 3: c.179G> T (p.Gly60Val) might be associated with a lethal form of Noonan syndrome. The malignant clinical course of the disease and the lethal outcome in an infant only a few months old might be connected to RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway hyperactivation, consequently promoting cell growth and proliferation, leading to rapidly progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Further biochemical and functional studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.	4
Differences in p53 status significantly influence the cellular response and cell survival to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-metformin cotreatment in colorectal cancer cells. || AMP-Activated Protein Kinases Antineoplastic Agents Calcitriol Cell Respiration Cell Survival Colon Colorectal Neoplasms Drug Synergism Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glycolysis HCT116 Cells Humans Hypoglycemic Agents Metformin Mutation Rectum Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vitamins Wnt Signaling Pathway || Mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 are highly prevalent in cancers and are known to influence the sensitivity of cells to various chemotherapeutics including the anti-cancer candidates 1,25-dihydrovitamin D3 [1,25D3] and metformin. Previous studies have demonstrated additive/synergistic anti-cancer effects of the 1,25D3-metformin combination in different models, however, the influence of p53 status on the efficacy of this regimen has not been investigated. The CRC colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines HCT116 wild-type (wt), HCT116 p53-/-, and HT-29 (mutant; R273H) were employed, covering three different p53 variations. Synergistic effects of the combination were confirmed in all cell lines using MTT assay. Detailed evaluation of the combination's effects was performed, including on-line measurements of cellular metabolism (glycolysis/respiration) using a biosensor chip system, analyses of mitochondrial activity (membrane potential and ATP/ROS production), mRNA expression analysis of WNT/β-catenin pathway players, and a comprehensive proteomic screen using immunoblotting and ELISA microarrays. AMPK signaling was found to be more strongly induced in response to all treatments in HCT116 wt cells compared to other cell lines, an observation that was coupled to a stronger accumulation of intracellular ROS in response to metformin/combination, and finally an induction in autophagy, depicted by an increase in LC3II:LC3I ratio in combination-treated cells compared to mono-treatments. An induction in apoptotic signaling was observed in the other cell lines in response to the combination, illustrated by a decrease in expression of pro-survival Bcl2 family members. P53 status impacts cellular responses to the combination but does not hamper its anti-proliferative synergy.	0
Simultaneous screening of multiple mutations by invader assay improves molecular diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss: a multicenter study. || Age of Onset Cathepsin A Child Child, Preschool Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation RNA, Ribosomal Sequence Analysis, DNA Sulfate Transporters || Although etiological studies have shown genetic disorders to be a common cause of congenital/early-onset sensorineural hearing loss, there have been no detailed multicenter studies based on genetic testing. In the present report, 264 Japanese patients with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss from 33 ENT departments nationwide participated. For these patients, we first applied the Invader assay for screening 47 known mutations of 13 known deafness genes, followed by direct sequencing as necessary. A total of 78 (29.5%) subjects had at least one deafness gene mutation. Mutations were more frequently found in the patients with congenital or early-onset hearing loss, i.e., in those with an awareness age of 0-6 years, mutations were significantly higher (41.8%) than in patients with an older age of awareness (16.0%). Among the 13 genes, mutations in GJB2 and SLC26A4 were mainly found in congenital or early-onset patients, in contrast with mitochondrial mutations (12S rRNA m.1555A>G, tRNA(Leu(UUR)) m.3243A>G), which were predominantly found in older-onset patients. The present method of simultaneous screening of multiple deafness mutations by Invader assay followed by direct sequencing will enable us to detect deafness mutations in an efficient and practical manner for clinical use.	4

Comprehensive tumor profiling identifies numerous biomarkers of drug response in cancers of unknown primary site: analysis of 1806 cases. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Child Child, Preschool Female Gene Expression Profiling Humans Immunohistochemistry In Situ Hybridization Infant Male Middle Aged Neoplasms, Unknown Primary Young Adult || Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for approximately 3% of all malignancies. Despite extensive laboratory and imaging efforts, the primary site usually cannot be unequivocally confirmed, and the treatment for the most part remains empirical. Recently, identification of common cancer pathway alterations in diverse cancer lineages has offered an opportunity to provide targeted therapies for patients with CUP, irrespective of the primary site. 1806 cancers of unknown primary were identified among more than 63,000 cases profiled at Caris Life Sciences. Multiplatform profiling of the tumor samples included immunohistochemistry, gene sequencing and in situ hybridization methods in an effort to identify changes in biomarkers that are predictive of drug responses. Biomarkers associated with a potential drug benefit were identified in 96% of cases. Biomarkers identified included those associated with potential benefit in nearly all classes of approved cancer drugs (cytotoxic, hormonal, targeted biological drugs). Additionally, biomarkers associated with a potential lack of benefit were identified in numerous cases, which could further refine the management of patients with CUP. Comprehensive biomarker profiling of CUP may provide additional choices in treatment of patients with these difficult to treat malignancies.	4
Dependable and Efficient Clinical Molecular Diagnosis of Chinese RP Patient with Targeted Exon Sequencing. || Adult Aged Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence China Cohort Studies Consanguinity Exons Family Health Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Middle Aged Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Mutation Pedigree Reproducibility of Results Retinitis Pigmentosa Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal disease. It is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder, which is why it is particularly challenging to diagnose. The aim of this study was to establish a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach for the comprehensive, rapid, and cost-effective clinical molecular diagnosis of RP. A specific hereditary eye disease enrichment panel (HEDEP) based on exome capture technology was used to collect the protein coding regions of 371 targeted hereditary eye disease genes, followed by high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. From a cohort of 34 Chinese RP families, 13 families were successfully diagnosed; thus, the method achieves a diagnostic rate of approximately 40%. Of 16 pathogenic mutations identified, 11 were novel. Our study demonstrates that targeted capture sequencing offers a rapid and effective method for the molecular diagnosis of RP, which helps to provide a more accurate clinical diagnosis and paves the way for genetic counseling, family planning, and future gene-targeted treatment.	4
Improving the genetic signature of prostate cancer, the somatic mutations. || Adenocarcinoma Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Case-Control Studies Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Cohort Studies Computer Simulation Databases, Factual Follow-Up Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation PTEN Phosphohydrolase Prognosis Prostatic Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Somatic mutations have been related to the highest incidence of metastatic disease and different treatment responses. The molecular cause of prostate cancer (PC) is still unclear; however, its progression involves alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as somatic mutations such as the ones in PIK3CA gene. A high percentage of PC is considered sporadic, which means that the damage to the genes occurs by chance after birth (mainly somatic mutations will drive the cancer event). However, little is known about somatic mutations in PC development. We evaluated prostate biopsies in the main somatic mutations genes (PIK3CA, TP53, EGFR, KIT, KRAS, PTEN, and BRAF) among individuals with PSA values>4ng/ml (n = 125), including affected and unaffected PC subjects. Mutations in KIT gene are related to aggressive PC: TNM stages II to III, Gleason score ≥ 7 and D'Amico risk (P = 0.037, 0.040, and 0.017). However, there are no statistical significant results when more than 3 somatic mutations are presented in the same individual. In relation to environmental factors (smoking, diet, alcohol intake, or workplace exposure) there are no significant differences in the effect of environmental exposure and the somatic mutation presence. The most prevalent mutations among patients with PC are c.1621A>C (rs3822214) in KIT, c.38G>C (rs112445441) in KRAS and c.733G>A (rs28934575) in TP53 genes. KRAS, KIT, and TP53 genes are the most prevalent ones in patients with PC. Somatic alterations predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements in PC remain largely undefined. We show that KIT, KRAS, and TP53 genes have a higher presence among patients with PC and that mutations in KIT gene are related to an aggressive PC. However, we did not find any environmental effect in somatic mutations among PC individuals.	4
Mutations of GJB2 encoding connexin 26 contribute to non-syndromic moderate and severe hearing loss in Pakistan. || Adult Alleles Child Connexin 26 Connexins Female Hearing Loss Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pakistan Pedigree Severity of Illness Index || Mutations of GJB2 which encode connexin 26, contribute to 6-7 % of profound deafness in Pakistan. We investigated the involvement of GJB2 mutations in a cohort of 84 pedigrees and 86 sporadic individuals with moderate or severe hearing loss. Individuals in eight consanguineous families and four sporadic cases (9.52 and 4.65 %, respectively) were homozygous or compound heterozygous for p.W24X or p.W77X mutations in GJB2. These two variants are also among the most common mutations known to cause profound deafness in South Asia. The association of identical mutations with both profound and less severe phenotype of hearing loss suggests that alleles of other genes modify the phenotype due to these GJB2 nonsense mutations. Our study demonstrates that GJB2 mutations are an important contributor to aetiology of moderate to severe hearing loss in Pakistan.	4
Molecular Mechanisms Governing the Stem Cell's Fate in Brain Cancer: Factors of Stemness and Quiescence. ||  || Cellular quiescence is a reversible, non-cycling state controlled by epigenetic, transcriptional and niche-associated molecular factors. Quiescence is a condition where molecular signaling pathways maintain the poised cell-cycle state whilst enabling rapid cell cycle re-entry. To achieve therapeutic breakthroughs in oncology it is crucial to decipher these molecular mechanisms employed by the cancerous milieu to control, maintain and gear stem cells towards re-activation. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have been extensively studied in most malignancies, including glioma. Here, the aberrant niche activities skew the quiescence/activation equilibrium, leading to rapid tumor relapse after surgery and/or chemotherapy. Unraveling quiescence mechanisms promises to afford prevention of (often multiple) relapses, a key problem in current glioma treatment. This review article covers the current knowledge regarding normal and aberrant cellular quiescence control whilst also exploring how different molecular mechanisms and properties of the neighboring cells can influence the molecular processes behind glioma stem cell quiescence.	0
Targeting mutant NRAS signaling pathways in melanoma. || Animals Humans Melanoma Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Protein Kinases Signal Transduction Skin Neoplasms ras Proteins || Cutaneous melanoma is a devastating form of skin cancer and its incidence is increasing faster than any other preventable cancer in the United States. The mutant NRAS subset of melanoma is more aggressive and associated with poorer outcomes compared to non-NRAS mutant melanoma. The aggressive nature and complex molecular signaling conferred by this transformation has evaded clinically effective treatment options. This review examines the major downstream effectors of NRAS relevant in melanoma and the associated advances made in targeted therapies that focus on these effector pathways. We outline the history of MEK inhibition in mutant NRAS melanoma and recent advances with newer MEK inhibitors. Since MEK inhibitors will likely be optimized when combined with other targeted therapies, we focus on recently identified targets that can be used in combination with MEK inhibitors.	0
Prevalence of low-penetrant germline TP53 D49H mutation in Japanese cancer patients. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Codon Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Japan Male Middle Aged Neoplasms Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Prevalence Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Using whole exome sequencing data obtained from 1,685 Japanese cancer patients, we examined genetic variations of germline TP53 and found 10 types of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants. In the present study, we focused on 6 patients with germline D49H mutation located in the transactivation domain 2 of p53 protein, since the mutation seemed to be prevalent in cancer patients and to be pathogenic. According to the initial survey for family history of the proband with the germline TP53 D49H mutation, one osteosarcoma patient and his pedigree fulfill the criteria for Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome and the 2009 Chompret criteria for germline TP53 mutation screening. Since this patient possesses double germline mutations of TP53 D49H and A159D, further studies are required to evaluate contribution of the D49H mutation in this morbidity. The remaining 5 patients had family histories of cancer, but none fulfills the criteria either for the Li-Fraumeni/Li-Fraumeni-like syndromes or the 2009 Chompret criteria for germline TP53 mutation screening. It is possible to postulate that the germline TP53 D49H mutation is likely to be low-penetrant in some pedigrees. The present study also indicates that the survey for the germline TP53 mutation plays an important role in clinical practice as it will prevent mistaking cancer patients with unusual heredities for sporadic cases.	4
Autophagy Regulated by Gain of Function Mutant p53 Enhances Proteasomal Inhibitor-Mediated Cell Death through Induction of ROS and ERK in Lung Cancer Cells. ||  || Mutations in p53, especially gain of function (GOF) mutations, are highly frequent in lung cancers and are known to facilitate tumor aggressiveness. Yet, the links between mutant GOF-p53 and lung cancers are not well established. In the present study, we set to examine how we can better sensitize resistant GOF-p53 lung cancer cells through modulation of cellular protein degradation machineries, proteasome and autophagy. H1299 p53 null lung cancer cells were stably transfected with R273H mutant GOF-p53 or wild-type (wt) p53 or empty vectors. The presence of R273H-P53 conferred the cancer cells with drug resistance not only against the widely used chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin (CDDP) or 5-flurouracil (5-FU) but also against potent alternative modes of therapy like proteasomal inhibition. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new strategies that can overcome GOF-p53 induced drug resistance and prolong patient survival following failure of standard therapies. We observed that the proteasomal inhibitor, peptide aldehyde N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (commonly termed as ALLN), caused an activation of cellular homeostatic machinery, autophagy in R273H-P53 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) alone or in combination with ALLN failed to induce enhanced cell death in the R273H-P53 cells; however, in contrast, an activation of autophagy by serum starvation or rapamycin increased sensitivity of cells to ALLN-induced cytotoxicity. An activated autophagy was associated with increased ROS and ERK signaling and an inhibition of either ROS or ERK signaling resulted in reduced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, inhibition of GOF-p53 was found to enhance autophagy resulting in increased cell death. Our findings provide novel insights pertaining to mechanisms by which a GOF-p53 harboring lung cancer cell is better sensitized, which can lead to the development of advanced therapy against resistant lung cancer cells.	0
Identification of Medically Actionable Secondary Findings in the 1000 Genomes. || Databases, Genetic Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genetic Variation Genome, Human Genomics Humans Mutation || The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends that clinical sequencing laboratories return secondary findings in 56 genes associated with medically actionable conditions. Our goal was to apply a systematic, stringent approach consistent with clinical standards to estimate the prevalence of pathogenic variants associated with such conditions using a diverse sequencing reference sample. Candidate variants in the 56 ACMG genes were selected from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes dataset, which contains sequencing information on 1,092 unrelated individuals from across the world. These variants were filtered using the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional version and defined parameters, appraised through literature review, and examined by a clinical laboratory specialist and expert physician. Over 70,000 genetic variants were extracted from the 56 genes, and filtering identified 237 variants annotated as disease causing by HGMD Professional. Literature review and expert evaluation determined that 7 of these variants were pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Furthermore, 5 additional truncating variants not listed as disease causing in HGMD Professional were identified as likely pathogenic. These 12 secondary findings are associated with diseases that could inform medical follow-up, including cancer predisposition syndromes, cardiac conditions, and familial hypercholesterolemia. The majority of the identified medically actionable findings were in individuals from the European (5/379) and Americas (4/181) ancestry groups, with fewer findings in Asian (2/286) and African (1/246) ancestry groups. Our results suggest that medically relevant secondary findings can be identified in approximately 1% (12/1092) of individuals in a diverse reference sample. As clinical sequencing laboratories continue to implement the ACMG recommendations, our results highlight that at least a small number of potentially important secondary findings can be selected for return. Our results also confirm that understudied populations will not reap proportionate benefits of genomic medicine, highlighting the need for continued research efforts on genetic diseases in these populations.	4
Absence of GJB2 gene mutations, the GJB6 deletion (GJB6-D13S1830) and four common mitochondrial mutations in nonsyndromic genetic hearing loss in a South African population. || Adolescent Africa South of the Sahara African Continental Ancestry Group Audiometry Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Gene Deletion Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Hearing Tests Humans Incidence Male Mass Screening Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of mutations in the GJB2 gene, the GJB6-D13S1830 deletion and the four common mitochondrial mutations (A1555G, A3243G, A7511C and A7445G) in a South African population. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing for screening GJB2 mutation; Multiplex PCR Amplification for GJB6-D13S1830 deletion and Restriction Fragment-Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis for the four common mtDNA mutations. We screened 182 hearing impaired students to determine the frequency of these mutations in the population. None of the reported disease causing mutations in GJB2 nor any novel pathogenic mutations in the coding region were detected, in contrast to the findings among Caucasians. The GJB6-D13S1830 deletion and the mitochondrial mutations were not observed in this group. These results suggest that GJB2 may not be a significant deafness gene among sub-Saharan Africans, pointing to other unidentified genes as responsible for nonsyndromic hearing loss in these populations.	4
Mutant p53 stimulates cell invasion through an interaction with Rad21 in human ovarian cancer cells. ||  || Missense mutations of TP53 are extremely common, and mutant p53 accumulation and gain-of-function play crucial roles in human ovarian cancer. Here, we investigated the role of mutant p53 in cell migration and invasion as well as its underlying molecular mechanisms in human ovarian cancer cells. Overexpression of mutant p53 significantly increased migration and invasion in p53-null SKOV3 cells. In contrast, knockdown of mutant p53 significantly compromised mutant p53-induced cell migration and invasion. Microarray analysis revealed that several migration/invasion-related genes, including S1PR1 (Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1) and THBS1 (Thrombospodin 1), were significantly upregulated in SKOV3 cells that overexpressed mutant p53-R248 (SKOV3R248). We found that Rad21 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the migration/invasion-related genes induced by mutant p53-R248. Knockdown of Rad21 significantly attenuated the mutant p53-R248-induced invasion and the expressions of S1PR1 and THBS1. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that mutant p53 interacts with Rad21 and binds to the Rad21-binding elements in the S1PR1 and THBS1 genes. Finally, downregulation of S1PR1 significantly attenuated the invasion driven by mutant p53-R248. These novel findings reveal that mutant p53-R248 maintains gain-of-function activity to stimulate cell invasion and induces the related gene expressions through an interaction with Rad21 in human ovarian cancer cells.	0

The poor prognosis and resistance to both radiation and chemotherapy warrant further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of NSCLC and the development of new, more efficacious therapeutics. The processes of autophagy and apoptosis, which induce degradation of proteins and organelles or cell death upon cellular stress, are crucial in the pathophysiology of NSCLC. The close interplay between autophagy and apoptosis through shared signaling pathways complicates our understanding of how NSCLC pathophysiology is regulated. The apoptotic effect of autophagy is controversial as both inhibitory and stimulatory effects have been reported in NSCLC. In addition, crosstalk of proteins regulating both autophagy and apoptosis exists. Here, we review the recent advances of the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in NSCLC, aiming to provide few insights into the discovery of novel pathogenic factors and the development of new cancer therapeutics.	0

Here we report whole-exome and deep sequencing of 30 paired oesophageal adenocarcinomas sampled before and after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Most, but not all, good responders pass through genetic bottlenecks, a feature associated with higher mutation burden pre-treatment. Some poor responders pass through bottlenecks, but re-grow by the time of surgical resection, suggesting a missed therapeutic opportunity. Cancers often show major changes in driver mutation presence or frequency after treatment, owing to outgrowth persistence or loss of sub-clones, copy number changes, polyclonality and/or spatial genetic heterogeneity. Post-therapy mutation spectrum shifts are also common, particularly C>A and TT>CT changes in good responders or bottleneckers. Post-treatment samples may also acquire mutations in known cancer driver genes (for example, SF3B1, TAF1 and CCND2) that are absent from the paired pre-treatment sample. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy can rapidly and profoundly affect the oesophageal adenocarcinoma genome. Monitoring molecular changes during treatment may be clinically useful.	4
Unequal allelic expression of wild-type and mutated β-myosin in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adult Alleles Allelic Imbalance Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial DNA Mutational Analysis Genotype Humans Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree RNA Stability RNA, Messenger Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Ventricular Myosins Young Adult || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is an autosomal dominant disease, which in about 30% of the patients is caused by missense mutations in one allele of the β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) gene (MYH7). To address potential molecular mechanisms underlying the family-specific prognosis, we determined the relative expression of mutant versus wild-type MYH7-mRNA. We found a hitherto unknown mutation-dependent unequal expression of mutant to wild-type MYH7-mRNA, which is paralleled by similar unequal expression of β-MHC at the protein level. Relative abundance of mutated versus wild-type MYH7-mRNA was determined by a specific restriction digest approach and by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Fourteen samples from M. soleus and myocardium of 12 genotyped and clinically well-characterized FHC patients were analyzed. The fraction of mutated MYH7-mRNA in five patients with mutation R723G averaged to 66 and 68% of total MYH7-mRNA in soleus and myocardium, respectively. For mutations I736T, R719W and V606M, fractions of mutated MYH7-mRNA in M. soleus were 39, 57 and 29%, respectively. For all mutations, unequal abundance was similar at the protein level. Importantly, fractions of mutated transcripts were comparable among siblings, in younger relatives and unrelated carriers of the same mutation. Hence, the extent of unequal expression of mutated versus wild-type transcript and protein is characteristic for each mutation, implying cis-acting regulatory mechanisms. Bioinformatics suggest mRNA stability or splicing effectors to be affected by certain mutations. Intriguingly, we observed a correlation between disease expression and fraction of mutated mRNA and protein. This strongly suggests that mutation-specific allelic imbalance represents a new pathogenic factor for FHC.	4
Identification of GABA(C) receptor protein homeostasis network components from three tandem mass spectrometry proteomics approaches. || Binding Sites Calnexin DNA-Binding Proteins Endoplasmic Reticulum Eye Proteins Gene Expression Regulation HEK293 Cells Heat Shock Transcription Factors Homeostasis Humans Mannose-Binding Lectins Membrane Proteins Protein Binding Protein Folding Protein Multimerization Protein Subunits Proteomics Receptors, GABA Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors Tandem Mass Spectrometry Transcription Factors Unfolded Protein Response X-Box Binding Protein 1 || γ-Amino butyric acid type C (GABA(C)) receptors inhibit neuronal firing primarily in retina. Maintenance of GABA(C) receptor protein homeostasis in cells is essential for its function. However, a systematic study of GABA(C) receptor protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network components is absent. Here coimmunoprecipitation of human GABA(C)-ρ1-receptor complexes was performed in HEK293 cells overexpressing ρ1 receptors. To enhance the coverage and reliability of identified proteins, immunoisolated ρ1-receptor complexes were subjected to three tandem mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analyses, namely, gel-based tandem MS (GeLC-MS/MS), solution-based tandem MS (SoLC-MS/MS), and multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT). From the 107 identified proteins, we assembled GABA(C)-ρ1-receptor proteostasis network components, including proteins with protein folding, degradation, and trafficking functions. We studied representative individual ρ1-receptor-interacting proteins, including calnexin, a lectin chaperone that facilitates glycoprotein folding, and LMAN1, a glycoprotein trafficking receptor, and global effectors that regulate protein folding in cells based on bioinformatics analysis, including HSF1, a master regulator of the heat shock response, and XBP1, a key transcription factor of the unfolded protein response. Manipulating selected GABA(C) receptor proteostasis network components is a promising strategy to regulate GABA(C) receptor folding, trafficking, degradation and thus function to ameliorate related retinal diseases.	0
Heterozygous p.Asp50Asn mutation in the GJB2 gene in two Cameroonian patients with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome. || Africa South of the Sahara Cameroon Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Ichthyosiform Erythroderma, Congenital Ichthyosis Keratitis Mutation || Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness (KID) syndrome (OMIM 148210) is a congenital ectodermal defect that consists of an atypical ichthyosiform erythroderma associated with congenital sensorineural deafness. KID appears to be genetically heterogeneous and most cases are caused by GJB2 mutations. Mutations in African patients have been rarely described. We report on two unrelated Cameroonian individuals affected with sporadic KID, presenting with the classic phenotypic triad. The two patients were heterozygous for the most frequent p.Asp50Asn mutation. This first report in patients from sub-Saharan African origin supports the hypothesis that the occurrence of KID due to p.Asp50Asn mutation in GJB2 seems not to be population specific. Our finding has implication in medical genetic practice, specifically in the molecular diagnosis of KID in Africans. These cases also reveal and emphasize the urgent need to develop appropriate policies to care for patients with rare/orphan diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa, as many of these cases become more and more recognizable.	4
Genetic mutations in non-syndromic deafness patients of Uyghur and Han Chinese ethnicities in Xinjiang, China: a comparative study. || Adolescent Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool China Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Ethnic Groups Female Genetic Loci Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Prevalence Young Adult || The deafness-associated gene mutation profile varies greatly among regions and races. Due to the multi-ethnic coalition of over one thousand years, non-syndromic deafness (NSD) patients of Uyghur ethnicity may exhibit a unique deafness-associated gene mutation spectrum as compared to Han Chinese deaf population. In order to characterize nine loci of four deafness-associated genes of Uyghur NSD patients in comparison with Chinese Han deaf population, NSD patients (n = 350) were enrolled, including Uyghur (n = 199) and Han Chinese (n = 151). Following the history taking, blood samples were collected for DNA extraction. DNA microarray was performed on nine loci of four deafness-associated genes, including 35delG, 176-191del16, 235delC, 299-300delAT, 538C > T, 1555A > G, 1494C > T, 2168A > G, and IVS7-2A > G. The samples that showed the absence of both wild and mutant probe signals were tested for further DNA sequencing analysis. The mutations in the nine loci of prevalent deafness-associated genes were detected in 13.06% of Uyghur NSD patients and 32.45% of Han Chinese patients (P < 0.05), respectively. GJB2 mutation was detected in 9.05% of Uyghur patients and 16.56% of Han Chinese patients (P > 0.05), respectively. 235delC was the hotspot mutation region in NSD patients of the two ethnicities, whereas 35delG was the mutation hotspot in Uyghur patients. 187delG mutation was detected for the first time in Uyghur NSD patients and considered as an unreported pathological variant of GJB2. SLC26A4 mutation was found in 2.01% of Uyghur patients and 14.57% of Han Chinese patients (P < 0.05), respectively. The frequencies of mtDNA 12S rRNA mutation in Uyghur and Han Chinese patients were 2.01% and 2.65% (P > 0.05), respectively. The NSD patients exhibited a low frequency of GJB3 mutation regardless of ethnicity. Prevalent deafness-associated gene mutations in the nine loci studied were less frequently detected in Uyghur NSD patients than in Han Chinese patients. GJB2 was the most common mutant gene in the two ethnicities, whilst the two ethnicities differed substantially in hotspot mutations. A low-frequency SLC26A4 mutation was detected in Uyghur NSD patients. Uyghur NSD patients differed significantly from Han Chinese patients in gene mutation profile.	4
CIIA negatively regulates the Ras-Erk1/2 signaling pathway through inhibiting the Ras-specific GEF activity of SOS1. || Animals Cyclin D1 DNA Replication Dogs Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport Epidermal Growth Factor Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors HEK293 Cells HeLa Cells Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells Mice Mutation, Missense NIH 3T3 Cells Noonan Syndrome SOS1 Protein ras Proteins || Son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) is a Ras-specific guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) that mediates intracellular signaling processes induced by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this study, we show that CIIA (also known as VPS28) physically associates with SOS1 and thereby inhibits the GEF activity of SOS1 on Ras, which prevents the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced activation of the Ras-Erk1/2 pathway. Furthermore, CIIA inhibited cyclin D1 expression, as well as DNA, synthesis in response to EGF. Intriguingly, CIIA failed to inhibit the Ras-specific GEF activity of Noonan-syndrome-associated SOS1 mutants (M269R, R552G, W729L and E846K). Taken together, our results suggest that CIIA functions as a negative modulator of the SOS1-Ras signaling events initiated by peptide growth factors including EGF.	0
A Skeletal Muscle Model of Infantile-onset Pompe Disease with Patient-specific iPS Cells. ||  || Pompe disease is caused by an inborn defect of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) and is characterized by lysosomal glycogen accumulation primarily in the skeletal muscle and heart. Patients with the severe type of the disease, infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), show generalized muscle weakness and heart failure in early infancy. They cannot survive over two years. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) improves the survival rate, but its effect on skeletal muscle is insufficient compared to other organs. Moreover, the patho-mechanism of skeletal muscle damage in IOPD is still unclear. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with IOPD and differentiated them into myocytes. Differentiated myocytes showed lysosomal glycogen accumulation, which was dose-dependently rescued by rhGAA. We further demonstrated that mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity was impaired in IOPD iPSC-derived myocytes. Comprehensive metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested the disturbance of mTORC1-related signaling, including deteriorated energy status and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative function. In summary, we successfully established an in vitro skeletal muscle model of IOPD using patient-specific iPSCs. Disturbed mTORC1 signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle damage in IOPD, and may be a potential therapeutic target for Pompe disease.	1
Audiologic presentation of enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct according to the SLC26A4 genotypes. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool Female Genotype Hearing Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Phenotype Prospective Studies Sulfate Transporters Vestibular Aqueduct Vestibular Diseases Young Adult || To determine the distribution of the number and types of mutant alleles of SLC26A4 and their correlations with hearing phenotypes in Korean bilateral enlargement of vestibular aqueduct (EVA) patients. Prospective cohort study. To determine the number and type of mutant alleles, Sanger sequencing of coding region of SLC26A4 was performed for 56 patients with bilateral EVA who were consecutively recruited. Their correlations with hearing phenotypes were analyzed based on 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 3-kHz air conduction averages of pure-tone audiometry. Most patients with bilateral EVA (83.9%) carried two mutant alleles of SLC26A4 (M2), and all others (16.1%) had only one detectable mutant allele of SLC26A4 (M1) in the Korean population. There were no cases with zero mutations. p.H723R/p.H723R was the most frequently observed mutant allelic pair (34%), followed by p.H723R/c.919-2A>G (20%). There was no significant difference in hearing threshold, progression, or fluctuation of hearing level between the M1 and M2 groups. However, focusing on the type of mutations exclusively in the M2 group, cases with p.H723R/c.919-2A>G were associated with more frequent progression of hearing loss during the follow-up period. The cases with p.H723R/c.919-2A>G tended to show slightly better hearing than p.H723R homozygotes, although the difference was not statistically significant. There appears to be a different genotype-auditory phenotype correlation among ethnicities. Our data suggest that the auditory phenotype of Korean bilateral EVA patients is more strongly correlated with the type rather than the number of mutations in SLC26A4. NA.	1
Mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene in southern Chinese families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Adult Aged Animals Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial China Conserved Sequence Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Pedigree Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Sequence Analysis, DNA Species Specificity Young Adult || In this study, 14 unrelated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) probands were scanned by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing. Three mis-sense mutations of the beta-myosin heavy chain gene, MYH7, were found: valine (Val) 606 methionine (Met), arginine (Arg) 694 leucine (Leu), and Arg 723 glycine (Gly). All are reported here for the first time in Chinese subjects. The results showed that: Val606Met is an intermediate malignancy mutation; Arg694Leu is a novel mutation with a benign phenotype; and the Arg723Gly mutation is linked to malignancy - it can lead not only to HCM but also to dilated cardiomyopathy at various ages. The clinical symptoms associated with Arg723Gly emerged early and caused more severe clinical manifestation and poorer prognosis in females than in males. Mis-sense mutations were not detected in the myosin binding protein C, cardiac, cardiac troponin T type 2, or cardiac troponin I type 3 genes. The MYH7 gene may be an HCM mutation hotspot in the Chinese and have unique features in this study population.	4
A comparison of ARMS and DNA sequencing for mutation analysis in clinical biopsy samples. || Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Humans Lung Neoplasms Melanoma Neoplasms Polymerase Chain Reaction Skin Neoplasms || We have compared mutation analysis by DNA sequencing and Amplification Refractory Mutation System™ (ARMS™) for their ability to detect mutations in clinical biopsy specimens. We have evaluated five real-time ARMS assays: BRAF 1799T>A, [this includes V600E and V600K] and NRAS 182A>G [Q61R] and 181C>A [Q61K] in melanoma, EGFR 2573T>G [L858R], 2235-2249del15 [E746-A750del] in non-small-cell lung cancer, and compared the results to DNA sequencing of the mutation 'hot-spots' in these genes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour (FF-PET) DNA. The ARMS assays maximised the number of samples that could be analysed when both the quality and quantity of DNA was low, and improved both the sensitivity and speed of analysis compared with sequencing. ARMS was more robust with fewer reaction failures compared with sequencing and was more sensitive as it was able to detect functional mutations that were not detected by DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was able to detect a small number of lower frequency recurrent mutations across the exons screened that were not interrogated using the specific ARMS assays in these studies. ARMS was more sensitive and robust at detecting defined somatic mutations than DNA sequencing on clinical samples where the predominant sample type was FF-PET.	4
Genetic counseling for patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment directed by gene analysis. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Family Genetic Counseling Genetic Testing Humans Infant Mutation Prenatal Diagnosis Young Adult || The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic etiology of patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment through gene analysis, and provide accurate genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for deaf patients and families with deaf children. Previous molecular etiological studies have demonstrated that the most common molecular changes in Chinese patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) involved gap junction protein β 2, solute carrier family 26, member 4 (SLC26A4), and mitochondrial DNA 12S rRNA. A total of 117 unrelated NSHL patients were included. Mutation screening was performed by Sanger sequencing in GJB2, 12S rRNA, and the hot‑spot regions of SLC26A4. In addition, patients with a single mutation of SLC26A4 in the hot‑spot regions underwent complete exon sequencing to identify a mutation in the other allele. A total of 36 of the 117 deaf patients were confirmed to have two pathogenic mutations, which included 4 deaf couples, husband or wife in 11 deaf couples and 17 deaf individuals. In addition, prenatal diagnoses was performed in 7 pregnant women at 18‑21 weeks gestation who had previously given birth to a deaf child, and the results showed that two fetal genotypes were the same as the proband's genotypes, four fetuses carried one pathogenic gene from their parents, and one fetus was identified to have no mutations. Taken together, the genetic testing of deaf patients can provide reasonable guidance to deaf patients and families with deaf children.	4
Diagnostic exome sequencing in 266 Dutch patients with visual impairment. || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Exome Eye Diseases, Hereditary Humans Inheritance Patterns Netherlands Vision Disorders || Inherited eye disorders have a large clinical and genetic heterogeneity, which makes genetic diagnosis cumbersome. An exome-sequencing approach was developed in which data analysis was divided into two steps: the vision gene panel and exome analysis. In the vision gene panel analysis, variants in genes known to cause inherited eye disorders were assessed for pathogenicity. If no causative variants were detected and when the patient consented, the entire exome data was analyzed. A total of 266 Dutch patients with different types of inherited eye disorders, including inherited retinal dystrophies, cataract, developmental eye disorders and optic atrophy, were investigated. In the vision gene panel analysis (likely), causative variants were detected in 49% and in the exome analysis in an additional 2% of the patients. The highest detection rate of (likely) causative variants was in patients with inherited retinal dystrophies, for instance a yield of 63% in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. In patients with developmental eye defects, cataract and optic atrophy, the detection rate was 50, 33 and 17%, respectively. An exome-sequencing approach enables a genetic diagnosis in patients with different types of inherited eye disorders using one test. The exome approach has the same detection rate as targeted panel sequencing tests, but offers a number of advantages. For instance, the vision gene panel can be frequently and easily updated with additional (novel) eye disorder genes. Determination of the genetic diagnosis improved the clinical diagnosis, regarding the assessment of the inheritance pattern as well as future disease perspective.	4
Plasma lipids, genetic variants near APOA1, and the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. ||  || Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a serious condition in which hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle layer leads to gastric outlet obstruction. Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis shows strong familial aggregation and heritability, but knowledge about specific genetic risk variants is limited. To search the genome comprehensively for genetic associations with IHPS and validate findings in 3 independent sample sets. During stage 1, we used reference data from the 1000 Genomes Project for imputation into a genome-wide data set of 1001 Danish surgery-confirmed samples (cases diagnosed 1987-2008) and 2371 disease-free controls. In stage 2, the 5 most significantly associated loci were tested in independent case-control sample sets from Denmark (cases diagnosed 1983-2010), Sweden (cases diagnosed 1958-2011), and the United States (cases diagnosed 1998-2005), with a total of 1663 cases and 2315 controls. Association of genetic variation with the presence of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. We found a new genome-wide significant locus for IHPS at chromosome 11q23.3. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the lowest P value at the locus, rs12721025 (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.38-1.83; P = 1.9 × 10(-10)), is located 301 bases downstream of the apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) gene and is correlated (r2 between 0.46 and 0.80) with SNPs previously found to be associated with levels of circulating cholesterol. For these SNPs, the cholesterol-lowering allele consistently was associated with increased risk of IHPS. This study identified a new genome-wide significant locus for IHPS. Characteristics of this locus suggest the possibility of an inverse relationship between levels of circulating cholesterol in neonates and IHPS risk, which warrants further investigation.	4
Abrogation of wild-type p53-mediated transactivation is insufficient for mutant p53-induced immortalization of normal human mammary epithelial cells. || Breast Cell Survival Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Cells, Cultured Enzyme Induction Epithelial Cells Female Humans Mutation Telomerase Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 protein has become a subject of intense interest since the discovery that about 50% of human cancers carry p53 mutations. Mutations in the p53 gene are the most frequent genetic lesions in breast cancer, suggesting a critical role for p53 protein in normal mammary epithelial cell (MEC) growth control. We previously demonstrated that abrogation of the p53 function by a cancer-derived p53 mutant, del239, was sufficient to induce immortalization of normal MECs. To further extend these findings and to examine the mechanism of mutant p53-induced immortalization of MECs, we tested the immortalizing ability of four selected p53 mutants (R175H, R248W, R249S, and R273H), which involve residues that cluster close to N239 in the three-dimensional structure and which are critical for the DNA-binding function of p53. Interestingly, two of these mutants (R175H and R249S) reproducibly immortalized 76N normal MECs, whereas the other two mutants (R248W and R273H) induced an extension of life span but not immortalization. These results further substantiate that selective ablation of p53 function with dominant-negative mutants is sufficient for immortalization of MECs. To determine whether abrogation of the transactivation function of endogenous p53 was important for the differential immortalizing ability of p53 mutants, we measured the effects of mutant p53 on the endogenous wild-type p53-mediated transactivation of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter linked to a consensus p53 binding DNA sequence in transiently transfected 76N MECs. All of the mutants, regardless of their immortalizing phenotype, abrogated the endogenous wild-type p53-mediated transactivation to a similar extent. Thus, abrogation of transactivation function is not sufficient for mutant p53-induced immortalization of normal MECs. The p53-immortalized MECs showed substantial telomerase activity; however, induction of telomerase activity occurred at late passages and was undetectable in mutant p53-expressing cells prior to immortalization. We suggest that mechanisms other than abrogation of transactivation and induction of telomerase activity determine the differential MEC-immortalizing behavior of various p53 mutants.	0
Carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1A (CPT1A): a new tumor specific target in human breast cancer. || Apoptosis Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase Cell Proliferation Epigenesis, Genetic Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Histone Deacetylase 1 Humans Molecular Dynamics Simulation Oxidation-Reduction Tumor Cells, Cultured || Transcriptional mechanisms epigenetically-regulated in tumoral tissues point out new targets for anti-cancer therapies. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the transport of long-chain fatty acids for β-oxidation. Here we identified the tumor specific nuclear CPT1A as a product of the transcript variant 2, that doesn't retain the classical transferase activity and is strongly involved in the epigenetic regulation of cancer pro-survival, cell death escaping and tumor invasion pathways. The knockdown of CPT1A variant 2 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), was sufficient to induce apoptosis in MCF-7, SK-BR3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The cell death triggered by CPT1A silencing correlated with reduction of HDAC activity and histone hyperacetylation. Docking experiments and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed an high binding affinity of the variant 2 for HDAC1. The CPT1A silenced cells showed an up-regulated transcription of pro-apoptotic genes (BAD, CASP9, COL18A1) and down-modulation of invasion and metastasis related-genes (TIMP-1, PDGF-A, SERPINB2). These findings provide evidence of the CPT1 variant 2 involvement in breast cancer survival, cell death escape and invasion. Thus, we propose nuclear CPT1A as a striking tumor specific target for anticancer therapeutics, more selective and effective as compared with the well-known HDAC inhibitors.	0
The Shp2-induced epithelial disorganization defect is reversed by HDAC6 inhibition independent of Cdc42. || Animals Dogs Epithelial Cells HEK293 Cells Histone Deacetylase 6 Histone Deacetylases Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells Phosphorylation Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Signal Transduction cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein || Regulation of Shp2, a tyrosine phosphatase, critically influences the development of various diseases. Its role in epithelial lumenogenesis is not clear. Here we show that oncogenic Shp2 dephosphorylates Tuba to decrease Cdc42 activation, leading to the abnormal multi-lumen formation of epithelial cells. HDAC6 suppression reverses oncogenic Shp2-induced multiple apical domains and spindle mis-orientation during division in cysts to acquire normal lumenogenesis. Intriguingly, Cdc42 activity is not restored in this rescued process. We present evidence that simultaneous reduction in myosin II and ERK1/2 activity by HDAC6 inhibition is responsible for the reversion. In HER2-positive breast cancer cells, Shp2 also mediates Cdc42 repression, and HDAC6 inhibition or co-suppression of ERK/myosin II promotes normal epithelial lumen phenotype without increasing Cdc42 activity. Our data suggest a mechanism of epithelial disorganization by Shp2 deregulation, and reveal the cellular context where HDAC6 suppression is capable of establishing normal epithelial lumenogenesis independent of Cdc42.	0
Phase II, open-label, randomized trial of the MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib as monotherapy versus temozolomide in patients with advanced melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating Benzimidazoles DNA Mutational Analysis Dacarbazine Disease-Free Survival Drug Substitution Female Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate MAP Kinase Kinase 1 MAP Kinase Kinase 2 Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Temozolomide Treatment Outcome Young Adult || To compare the efficacy and tolerability of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib versus temozolomide in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable stage III/IV melanoma. This phase II, open-label, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study examined the effect of 100 mg oral selumetinib twice daily in 28-day cycles versus oral temozolomide (200 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days, then 23 days off-treatment). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Two hundred patients were randomized. Progression-free survival did not differ significantly between selumetinib and temozolomide (median time to event 78 and 80 days, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.07; 80% confidence interval, 0.86-1.32). Objective response was observed in six (5.8%) patients receiving selumetinib and nine (9.4%) patients in the temozolomide group. Among patients with BRAF mutations, objective responses were similar between selumetinib and temozolomide groups (11.1% and 10.7%, respectively). However, five of the six selumetinib partial responders were BRAF mutated. Frequently reported adverse events with selumetinib were dermatitis acneiform (papular pustular rash; 59.6%), diarrhea (56.6%), nausea (50.5%), and peripheral edema (40.4%), whereas nausea (64.2%), constipation (47.4%), and vomiting (44.2%) were reported with temozolomide. No significant difference in progression-free survival was observed between patients with unresectable stage III/IV melanoma unselected for BRAF/NRAS mutations, who received therapy with selumetinib or temozolomide. Five of six patients with partial response to selumetinib had BRAF mutant tumors.	4
Genetic background of clinical homogeneity of phenylketonuria in Poland. || Base Sequence Genetic Testing Genetics, Population Haplotypes Humans Infant, Newborn Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Oligonucleotide Probes Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Poland Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || In order to elucidate the clinical homogeneity and severity of the hyperphenylalaninaemias in Poland, a total of 71 children with typical phenylketonuria (PKU) originating from western and northern Poland were screened for 13 mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Eighty percent of all PKU alleles tested were found to carry an identified mutation. One mutation, namely the R408W mutation, accounted for more than 63% of mutant PAH alleles in Poland, the other 27% being accounted for by six mutations: IVS12nt1 (5%), IVSnt546 (5%), Y414C (4%), R252W (1.5%), R261Q (< 1%), and G272ter (< 1%). The predominance of the R408W mutation resulted in a high rate of homozygotes (35.2%) and compound heterozygotes for this mutation in children from western and northern Poland. The frequency and deleterious nature of this mutation probably accounts for the clinical homogeneity and severity of the hyperphenylalaninaemias in Poland. In addition, the high rate of the R408W mutation and its association with mutant haplotype 2 at the PAH locus in Poland give additional support to the Balto-Slavic origin of this mutant gene.	3
Variations in the GLA gene correlate with globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine analog levels in urine and plasma. || Adult Aged Alleles Fabry Disease Glycolipids Humans Male Middle Aged Models, Molecular Mutation Protein Conformation Sphingolipids Trihexosylceramides Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || Recent data have shown that lyso-Gb3, the deacylated derivative of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of Fabry disease (FD) and might be a clinically useful biomarker of its metabolic load. To test this hypothesis, we assayed Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 and related analogs in plasma and/or urine samples of 12 clinically well-characterized subjects carrying several different GLA variant alleles associated with a wide range of residual α-galactosidase A activities. Urinary Gb3 was measured by HPLC-MS/MS; plasma and urinary lyso-Gb3 and related analogs were measured by UPLC-MS/MS. Individual profiles of Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 and related analogs closely correlated with the phenotypic data for each subject, discerning the classical FD patient from the two patients carrying cardiac variants as well as those from all the others without FD. The lyso-Gb3 analog at m/z 836 was found at increased levels only in patients manifesting clinically severe heart disease, irrespective of the pathogenicity of the GLA variant they carried. This finding suggests that this lyso-Gb3 analog might be an earlier biomarker of progressive heart disease, non-specific of the FD cardiomyopathy. The possibility that urinary Gb3 is a specific marker of kidney involvement in FD deserves further study.	4
Development and Validation of an Ultradeep Next-Generation Sequencing Assay for Testing of Plasma Cell-Free DNA from Patients with Advanced Cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Circulating Tumor DNA Female Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Prognosis Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity || Purpose: Tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma can be used for molecular testing and provide an attractive alternative to tumor tissue. Commonly used PCR-based technologies can test for limited number of alterations at the time. Therefore, novel ultrasensitive technologies capable of testing for a broad spectrum of molecular alterations are needed to further personalized cancer therapy.Experimental Design: We developed a highly sensitive ultradeep next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay using reagents from TruSeqNano library preparation and NexteraRapid Capture target enrichment kits to generate plasma cfDNA sequencing libraries for mutational analysis in 61 cancer-related genes using common bioinformatics tools. The results were retrospectively compared with molecular testing of archival primary or metastatic tumor tissue obtained at different points of clinical care.Results: In a study of 55 patients with advanced cancer, the ultradeep NGS assay detected 82% (complete detection) to 87% (complete and partial detection) of the aberrations identified in discordantly collected corresponding archival tumor tissue. Patients with a low variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutant cfDNA survived longer than those with a high VAF did (P = 0.018). In patients undergoing systemic therapy, radiological response was positively associated with changes in cfDNA VAF (P = 0.02), and compared with unchanged/increased mutant cfDNA VAF, decreased cfDNA VAF was associated with longer time to treatment failure (TTF;P = 0.03).Conclusions: Ultradeep NGS assay has good sensitivity compared with conventional clinical mutation testing of archival specimens. A high VAF in mutant cfDNA corresponded with shorter survival. Changes in VAF of mutated cfDNA were associated with TTF.Clin Cancer Res; 23(18); 5648-56. ©2017 AACR.	4
Whole-Exome Sequencing of Salivary Gland Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid DNA Copy Number Variations Exome Female Genomics Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Grading Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Staging Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Salivary Gland Neoplasms Translocation, Genetic Whole Exome Sequencing || Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common salivary gland malignancy. To explore the genetic origins of MEC, we performed systematic genomic analyses of these tumors. Whole-exome sequencing and gene copy-number analyses were performed for 18 primary cancers with matched normal tissue. FISH was used to determine the presence or absence of the MECT1-MAML2 translocation in 17 tumors. TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in MEC (28%), and mutations were found only in intermediate- and high-grade tumors. Tumors with TP53 mutations had more mutations overall than tumors without TP53 mutations (P = 0.006). POU6F2 was the second most frequently mutated gene, found in three low-grade MECs with the same in-frame deletion. Somatic alterations in IRAK1, MAP3K9, ITGAL, ERBB4, OTOGL, KMT2C, and OBSCN were identified in at least two of the 18 tumors sequenced. FISH analysis confirmed the presence of the MECT1-MAML2 translocation in 15 of 17 tumors (88%). Through these integrated genomic analyses, MECT1-MAML2 translocation and somatic TP53 and POU6F2 mutations appear to be the main drivers of MEC. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 283-8. ©2016 AACR.	4
The disordered hypervariable region and the folded catalytic domain of oncogenic K-Ras4B partner in phospholipid binding. || Animals Catalytic Domain Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genetic Variation Humans Membrane Microdomains Mutation Neoplasms Phospholipids Protein Binding Protein Folding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Isoforms Protein Transport Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction || The C-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of the splice variant KRAS4B is disordered. Classically, the role of the post-translationally-modified HVR is to navigate Ras in the cell and to anchor it in localized plasma membrane regions. Here, we propose additional regulatory roles, including auto-inhibition by shielding the effector binding site in the GDP-bound state and release upon GTP binding and in the presence of certain oncogenic mutations. The released HVR can interact with calmodulin. We show that oncogenic mutations (G12V/G12D) modulate the HVR-phospholipid binding specificity, resulting in preferential interactions with phosphatidic acid. The shifts in the conformational preferences and binding specificity in the disordered state exemplify the critical role of the unstructured tail of K-Ras4B in cancer.	0
Genotypes of patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in the Wisconsin Amish. ||  || In the Plain Community, there is an increased frequency of genetic disorders including phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. Common pathogenic variants have been observed due to founder effect and closed community. This study obtained genotypes of 12 Plain individuals with PAH deficiency, identified through newborn screen or diagnosed by symptomatic presentation, who are receiving medical care at the University of Wisconsin metabolic clinic. Genotype and phenotypic data were evaluated to characterize genotype-phenotype correlations. Results can inform the need for confirmatory testing for the disorder and provide a better understanding of the biochemical phenotype, which may help with management.	1 3
Genomic and Molecular Landscape of DNA Damage Repair Deficiency across The Cancer Genome Atlas. ||  || DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways modulate cancer risk, progression, and therapeutic response. We systematically analyzed somatic alterations to provide a comprehensive view of DDR deficiency across 33 cancer types. Mutations with accompanying loss of heterozygosity were observed in over 1/3 of DDR genes, including TP53 and BRCA1/2. Other prevalent alterations included epigenetic silencing of the direct repair genes EXO5, MGMT, and ALKBH3 in ∼20% of samples. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present at varying frequency in many cancer types, most notably ovarian cancer. However, in contrast to ovarian cancer, HRD was associated with worse outcomes in several other cancers. Protein structure-based analyses allowed us to predict functional consequences of rare, recurrent DDR mutations. A new machine-learning-based classifier developed from gene expression data allowed us to identify alterations that phenocopy deleterious TP53 mutations. These frequent DDR gene alterations in many human cancers have functional consequences that may determine cancer progression and guide therapy.	4
Detection rate of actionable mutations in diverse cancers using a biopsy-free (blood) circulating tumor cell DNA assay. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Biopsy Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases DNA Copy Number Variations DNA, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Neoplastic Cells, Circulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met Receptor, Notch1 Retrospective Studies Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Analysis of cell-free DNA using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for the detection/monitoring of alterations present in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Plasma extracted from 171 patients with a variety of cancers was analyzed for ctDNA (54 genes and copy number variants (CNVs) in three genes (EGFR, ERBB2 and MET)). The most represented cancers were lung (23%), breast (23%), and glioblastoma (19%). Ninety-nine patients (58%) had at least one detectable alteration. The most frequent alterations were TP53 (29.8%), followed by EGFR (17.5%), MET (10.5%), PIK3CA (7%), and NOTCH1 (5.8%). In contrast, of 222 healthy volunteers, only one had an aberration (TP53). Ninety patients with non-brain tumors had a discernible aberration (65% of 138 patients; in 70% of non-brain tumor patients with an alteration, the anomaly was potentially actionable). Interestingly, nine of 33 patients (27%) with glioblastoma had an alteration (6/33 (18%) potentially actionable). Overall, sixty-nine patients had potentially actionable alterations (40% of total; 69.7% of patients (69/99) with alterations); 68 patients (40% of total; 69% of patients with alterations), by a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug. In summary, 65% of diverse cancers (as well as 27% of glioblastomas) had detectable ctDNA aberration(s), with the majority theoretically actionable by an approved agent.	4
Additional germline findings from a tumor profiling program. ||  || Matched tumor-normal sequencing, applied in precision cancer medicine, can identify unidentified germline Medically Actionable Variants (gMAVS) in cancer predisposition genes. We report patient preferences for the return of additional germline results, and describe various gMAV scenarios delivered through a clinical genetics service. Tumor profiling was offered to 1960 advanced cancer patients, of which 1556 underwent tumor-normal sequencing with multigene hotspot panels containing 20 cancer predisposition genes. All patients were provided with an IRB-approved consent for return of additional gMAVs. Of the whole cohort 94% of patients consented to be informed of additional germline results and 5% declined, with no statistically significant differences based on age, sex, race or prior genetic testing. Eight patients were found to have gMAVs in a cancer predisposition gene. Five had previously unidentified gMAVs: three in TP53 (only one fulfilled Chompret's Revised criteria for Li-Fraumeni Syndrome), one in SMARCB1 in the absence of schwannomatosis features and one a TP53 variant at low allele frequency suggesting an acquired event in blood. Interest in germline findings is high among patients who undergo tumor profiling. Disclosure of previously unidentified gMAVs present multiple challenges, thus supporting the involvement of a clinical genetics service in all tumor profiling programs.	4
Clinical characteristics of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over ErbB Receptors Female Genes, ras Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Smoking || BRAF mutations occur in non-small-cell lung cancer. Therapies targeting BRAF mutant tumors have recently been identified. We undertook this study to determine the clinical characteristics of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations. We reviewed data from consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma whose tumors underwent BRAF, EGFR, and KRAS mutation testing as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK rearrangements. Patient characteristics including age, sex, race, performance status, smoking history, stage, treatment history, and overall survival were collected. Among 697 patients with lung adenocarcinoma, BRAF mutations were present in 18 patients (3%; 95% CI, 2% to 4%). The BRAF mutations identified were V600E (50%), G469A (39%), and D594G (11%). Mutations in EGFR were present in 24%, KRAS in 25%, and ALK translocations in 6%. In contrast to patients with EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements who were mostly never smokers, all patients with BRAF mutations were current or former smokers (P < .001). The median overall survival of advanced-stage patients with BRAF mutations was not reached. In comparison, the median overall survival of patients with EGFR mutations was 37 months (P = .73), with KRAS mutations was 18 months (P = .12), and with ALK rearrangements was not reached (P = .64). BRAF mutations occur in 3% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and occur more commonly in current and former smokers. The incidence of BRAF mutations other than V600E is significantly higher in lung cancer than in melanoma.	4
Recognition of Local DNA Structures by p53 Protein. || Animals Binding Sites DNA DNA, B-Form Humans Nucleic Acid Conformation Protein Binding Structure-Activity Relationship Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 plays critical roles in regulating cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence and metabolism and is commonly mutated in human cancer. These roles are achieved by interaction with other proteins, but particularly by interaction with DNA. As a transcription factor, p53 is well known to bind consensus target sequences in linear B-DNA. Recent findings indicate that p53 binds with higher affinity to target sequences that form cruciform DNA structure. Moreover, p53 binds very tightly to non-B DNA structures and local DNA structures are increasingly recognized to influence the activity of wild-type and mutant p53. Apart from cruciform structures, p53 binds to quadruplex DNA, triplex DNA, DNA loops, bulged DNA and hemicatenane DNA. In this review, we describe local DNA structures and summarize information about interactions of p53 with these structural DNA motifs. These recent data provide important insights into the complexity of the p53 pathway and the functional consequences of wild-type and mutant p53 activation in normal and tumor cells.	0
Evidence for single origins of 35delG and delE120 mutations in the GJB2 gene in Anatolia. || Adolescent Adult Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Family Health Female Frameshift Mutation Gene Frequency Genetic Markers Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Pedigree Topography, Medical Turkey || Eighteen different sequence changes, including three novel alterations, were detected in GJB2, encoding connexin 26, in 371 Turkish probands with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Two frequently detected mutations, 35delG and delE120, were shown to have single origins based on the conserved genotypes of two closely linked microsatellite and five single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Carrier frequencies of 35delG and delE120 in Egypt and Turkic populations of the Near East provide insights about the origin of these two mutations.	4

[Analysis of mutations in exon 7 of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene among children with phenylketonuria in Ningxia, China]. ||  || To investigate the type and frequency of mutations in exon 7 of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene among children with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Ningxia, China and to provide a basis for the genetic diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis of PKU in this region. Direct sequencing of PCR product was performed to analyze the sequences of exon 7 and its flanking introns of 146 PAH alleles in 73 children with typical PKU (39 cases of Hui nationality and 34 cases of Han nationality) in Ningxia. Six mutations were detected, including R243Q (14.4%), R241C (6.8%), IVS7+2T→A (2.7%), L255S (0.7%), G247V (0.7%), and G247R (0.7%). The overall frequency of mutations (missense mutation and splice site mutation) in exon 7 was 26.0% (38/146). The detection rate of R241C mutation was significantly higher in children of Hui nationality than in children of Han nationality(10% vs 3%; P<0.05). In Ningxia, R243Q mutation in exon 7 of PAH gene is most common in children with PKU, followed by R241C. The frequency of R241C mutation in exon 7 of PAH gene varies between children with PKU of Hui and Han nationality.	3
Next-generation sequencing-based molecular diagnosis of 82 retinitis pigmentosa probands from Northern Ireland. || Family Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Mutation Northern Ireland Pathology, Molecular Retinitis Pigmentosa || Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal disorders characterized by progressive photoreceptor degeneration. An accurate molecular diagnosis is essential for disease characterization and clinical prognoses. A retinal capture panel that enriches 186 known retinal disease genes, including 55 known RP genes, was developed. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed for a cohort of 82 unrelated RP cases from Northern Ireland, including 46 simplex cases and 36 familial cases. Disease-causing mutations were identified in 49 probands, including 28 simplex cases and 21 familial cases, achieving a solving rate of 60 %. In total, 65 pathogenic mutations were found, and 29 of these were novel. Interestingly, the molecular information of 12 probands was neither consistent with their initial inheritance pattern nor clinical diagnosis. Further clinical reassessment resulted in a refinement of the clinical diagnosis in 11 patients. This is the first study to apply next-generation sequencing-based, comprehensive molecular diagnoses to a large number of RP probands from Northern Ireland. Our study shows that molecular information can aid clinical diagnosis, potentially changing treatment options, current family counseling and management.	4
Genetic evaluation based on family history and Her2 status correctly identifies TP53 mutations in very early onset breast cancer cases. || Adult Age of Onset Base Sequence Breast Neoplasms Female Greece Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense Pedigree Polymerase Chain Reaction Receptor, ErbB-2 Sequence Analysis, DNA Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Currently, hereditary breast cancer is being attributed to more than 20 genes of differing penetrance. Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 are still the genes of reference for breast cancer susceptibility, extreme breast cancer phenotypes may be the result of deleterious alleles of other genes. Here, we report three families with early-onset breast cancer that were initially referred for BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing. They were diagnosed with breast cancer at an extraordinarily early age. On the basis of their extensive family history, which included multiple cancer types, and their Her2 status, they were suspected for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Indeed, all three probands were found to harbor TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. These included p.C275X, described here for the first time, as well as p.R213X and p.Y220C, which have been described in the past. Our conclusion is that decisions on genetic analysis for inherited early onset breast cancer should always be based on detailed pedigree information, combined with Her2 status.	4
Association of TP53 polymorphisms on the risk of Wilms tumor. || Child, Preschool Female Genes, p53 Genotype Humans Infant Kidney Neoplasms Male Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Risk Wilms Tumor || Molecular factors influencing Wilms tumor (WT) development remain largely unknown. TP53 mutations seem to be restricted to the anaplastic WT subtype. However, TP53 polymorphisms do not have a defined role in the disease. To assess the impact of TP53 mutations and polymorphisms (PIN2, PIN3, and PEX4) on risk of development, age at diagnosis, and survival in WT, we analyzed 46 blood DNA samples and 31 fresh tumor DNA samples from 52 patients with WT. Sequencing of TP53 exons 2-11 was performed. Tumor DNA analysis revealed TP53 pathogenic missense mutations (p.V197M, p.R213Q, p.R248W, and p.R337C) in four samples (12.9%). Blood DNA samples revealed a novel intronic mutation, IVS2 + 37C > T, in one patient (2.2%). Bilaterality was associated with a twofold decrease in survival (P = 0.00037). Diffuse anaplasia also presented a lower survival probability compared to patients with non-anaplastic tumors, or with focal anaplasia (P = 0.045). Patients with a TP53 somatic mutation showed survival probability of 37.5% versus 85.0% for patients with no somatic mutations, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.0706). PIN3 duplicated allele was associated with a 20-month later mean age at diagnosis (P = 0.0084). TP53 PEX4 C allele showed an increased risk for WT development (P = 0.0379). No relationship was found between survival and gender, age at diagnosis, or the less frequent alleles of PIN2, PIN3, and PEX4. Our results demonstrate an association between PIN3 and age at diagnosis, as well as an association of PEX4 and risk of development of WT.	4
Ultra-deep targeted sequencing of advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma identifies a mutation-based prognostic gene signature. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Squamous Cell DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival Female Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Head and Neck Neoplasms High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Mouth Neoplasms Multivariate Analysis Mutation Neoplasm Staging Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Proportional Hazards Models Reproducibility of Results Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck Time Factors Treatment Outcome || Patients with advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have heterogeneous outcomes that limit the implementation of tailored treatment options. Genetic markers for improved prognostic stratification are eagerly awaited. Herein, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed in 345 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples obtained from advanced OSCC patients. Genetic mutations on the hotspot regions of 45 cancer-related genes were detected using an ultra-deep (>1000×) sequencing approach. Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the mutation status and disease-free survival (DFS). We identified 1269 non-synonymous mutations in 276 OSCC samples. TP53, PIK3CA, CDKN2A, HRAS and BRAF were the most frequently mutated genes. Mutations in 14 genes were found to predict DFS. A mutation-based signature affecting ten genes (HRAS, BRAF, FGFR3, SMAD4, KIT, PTEN, NOTCH1, AKT1, CTNNB1, and PTPN11) was devised to predict DFS. Two different resampling methods were used to validate the prognostic value of the identified gene signature. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that presence of a mutated gene signature was an independent predictor of poorer DFS (P = 0.005). Genetic variants identified by NGS technology in FFPE samples are clinically useful to predict prognosis in advanced OSCC patients.	4
Role of the CRISPR system in controlling gene transcription and monitoring cell fate (Review). || Animals CRISPR-Cas Systems Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats Epigenesis, Genetic Genetic Loci Humans RNA, Untranslated Transcriptional Activation || Even though the accrual of transcripts is implicated in distinct disease states, our knowledge regarding their functional role remains obscure. The CRISPR system has surged at the forefront of genome engineering tools in the field of RNA modulation. In the present review, we discuss some exciting applications of the CRISPR system, including the manipulation of RNA sequences, the visualization of chromosomal loci in living cells and the modulation of transcription. The CRISPR system has been documented to be very reliable and specific in altering gene expression, via leveraging inactive catalytically dead CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). In the present review, the CRISPR system is presented as an eminent tool for the meticulous analysis of gene regulation, loci mapping and complex pathways.	0

Delayed or late-onset type II glycogenosis with globular inclusions. || Adult Child Female Glycogen Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Inclusion Bodies Male Microscopy, Electron, Transmission Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction alpha-Glucosidases || Three unrelated patients, one girl, one boy, and an adult female, aged 14, 11 and 41 years, respectively, at the time of biopsy, revealed lysosomal glycogen storage, autophagic vacuoles and peculiar globular inclusions of distinct ultrastructure, which were reducing but did not appear like true "reducing bodies" as described in the congenital myopathy "reducing body myopathy". All three patients had residual activity of acid alpha-glucosidase in their muscle biopsy samples. Leukocytes in the girl showed normal acid alpha-glucosidase activity, but in the boy activity was reduced. Molecular genetic analysis of the GAA gene revealed disease-causing mutations in each patient: H568L/R672W, IVS1-13T>G/G615F, and IVS1-13T>G/IVS1-13T>G. Although only one patient with such globular inclusions has been reported up to now, the three patients described here indicate that in the late-onset type of GSD II such inclusions may not be rare.	1
APR-246 overcomes resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin in ovarian cancer cells. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cells, Cultured Cisplatin Deoxycytidine Docetaxel Doxorubicin Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Enzyme Activation Female Glutathione Humans Mice Mice, Nude Ovarian Neoplasms Protein Folding Quinuclidines Random Allocation Taxoids Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Two main causes of platinum resistance are mutation in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and drug-induced increase in intracellular glutathione concentration. Mutations in TP53 occur in about 50% of human tumors. APR-246 (PRIMA-1(MET)) is the first clinical-stage compound that reactivates mutant p53 and induces apoptosis. APR-246 is a prodrug that is converted to the active compound methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), a Michael acceptor that binds to cysteine residues in mutant p53 and restores its wild-type conformation. Here, we show that MQ also binds to cysteine in glutathione, thus decreasing intracellular free glutathione concentration. We also show that treatment with APR-246 completely restores the cisplatin and doxorubicin sensitivity to p53-mutant drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We propose that this unique ability of APR-246/MQ to bind to cysteines in both mutant p53 and glutathione has a key role in the resensitization as well as in the outstanding synergistic effects observed with APR-246 in combination with platinum compounds in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. However, MQ binding to cysteines in other targets, for example, thioredoxin reductase, may contribute as well. Strong synergy was also observed with the DNA-damaging drugs doxorubicin and gemcitabine, while additive effects were found with the taxane docetaxel. Our results provide a strong rationale for the ongoing clinical study with APR-246 in combination with platinum-based therapy in patients with p53-mutant recurrent high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer. More than 96% of these patients carry TP53 mutations. Combined treatment with APR-246 and platinum or other DNA-damaging drugs could allow dramatically improved therapy of a wide range of therapy refractory p53 mutant tumors.	0
Detection of somatic mutations in cell-free DNA in plasma and correlation with overall survival in patients with solid tumors. ||  || A suitable clinical-grade platform is required for detection of somatic mutations with high sensitivity in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with solid tumors. In this study, we evaluated in parallel ultra-deep NGS with MassARRAY and allele-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for cfDNA genotyping and correlated cfDNA yield and mutation status with overall survival (OS) of patients. We assessed plasma samples from 46 patients with various advanced metastatic solid tumors and known mutations by deep sequencing using an Ampliseq cancer hotspot panel V2 on Ion Proton. A subset of these samples with DNA availability was tested by ddPCR and UltraSEEK MassARRAY for mutation detection in 5 genes (IDH1, PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF, and NRAS). Sixty one of 104 expected tissue mutations and 6 additional mutations not present in the tissue were detected in cfDNA. ddPCR and MassARRAY showed 83% and 77% concordance with NGS for mutation detection with 100% and 79% sensitivity, respectively. The median OS of patients with lower cfDNA yield (74 vs 50 months; P < 0.03) and cfDNA negative for mutations (74.2 vs 53 months;p < 0.04) was significantly longer than in patients with higher cfDNA yield and positive for mutations. A limit-of-detection of 0.1% was demonstrated for ddPCR and MassARRAY platforms using a serially diluted positive cfDNA sample. The MassARRAY and ddPCR systems enable fast and cost-effective genotyping for a targeted set of mutations and can be used for single gene testing to guide response to chemotherapy or for orthogonal validation of NGS results.	4
Mutant, wild type, or overall p53 expression: freedom from clinical progression in tumours of astrocytic lineage. || Astrocytoma Cell Lineage DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Disease Progression Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Immunoenzyme Techniques Male Massachusetts Middle Aged Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Prognosis Risk Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Abnormalities of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene are found in a significant proportion of astrocytic brain tumours. We studied tumour specimens from 74 patients evaluated over 20 years at the Massachusetts General Hospital, where clinical outcome could be determined and sufficient pathologic material was available for immunostaining. p53 expression studies employed an affinity-purified p53 monoclonal antibody, whose specificity was verified in absorption studies and, in a minority of cases, a second antibody recognising a different epitope of p53. Significant overexpression of p53 protein was found in 48% of the 74 tumours included in this series and high levels of expression were associated with higher mortality from astrocytic tumours (P<0.001, log rank). Multivariate analyses revealed that immunohistochemically detected p53 was an independent marker of shortened progression-free and overall actuarial survival in patients with astrocytic tumours, suggesting that increased expression of p53 plays an important role in the pathobiology of these tumours. In a subset of 36 cases, coding regions of the p53 gene were completely sequenced via SSCP and direct DNA sequencing, revealing that overexpression of p53 protein is not always associated with point mutations in conserved exons of the p53 gene. Finally, we confirmed p53 protein expression in early-passage human glioma cell lines of known p53 mutational status and immunostaining scores. Although grade continues to be the strongest prognostic variable, the use of p53 staining as a prognostic indicator, in contrast to mutational DNA analyses, may be a useful adjunct in identifying patients at higher risk of treatment failure.	4
Q289P mutation in FGFR2 gene causes Saethre-Chotzen syndrome: some considerations about familial heterogeneity. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Algorithms Craniosynostoses Exons Female Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Male Mutation Nuclear Proteins Polymerase Chain Reaction Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 Twist-Related Protein 1 || To describe the first report on a three-generation family presenting typical features of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, in which the Q289P mutation in the FGFR2 gene was detected. Dysmorphological evaluation was performed by a clinical geneticist. Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding region of TWIST and screening for the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene were performed. Exons IIIa and IIIc of FGFR2 were sequenced also. The mutation was confirmed by both restriction-enzyme digestion and allelic-specific polymerase chain reaction. Neither TWIST gene analysis nor analysis of the P250R mutation on gene FGFR3 showed mutation within the coding sequence. A nucleotide change from CAG to CCG in exon IIIa of the FGFR2 gene that caused a Q289P mutation was detected, although exon IIIc in the propositus was normal. These same results were detected in his mother, but no other members of the kindred presented clinical features consistent with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This mutation was previously reported in individuals with Crouzon and Jackson-Weiss syndromes. The FGFR2 mutation in the family with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome herein reported reinforces the idea of an interaction among TWIST and FGFR genes during development. Absence of the Q289P mutation in some affected individuals in this family is discussed.	4
C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions in clinical Alzheimer disease. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alzheimer Disease C9orf72 Protein Case-Control Studies Cohort Studies DNA Repeat Expansion Female Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Proteins || Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene underlie a significant fraction of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To investigate the frequency of C9orf72 repeat expansions in clinically diagnosed late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). This case-control study genotyped the C9orf72 repeat expansion in 872 unrelated familial AD cases and 888 control subjects recruited as part of the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease Family Study cohort, a multisite collaboration studying 1000 families with 2 or more individuals clinically diagnosed as having late-onset AD. We determined the presence or absence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, the length of the longest nonexpanded allele, segregation of the genotype with disease, and clinical features of repeat expansion carriers. RESULTS Three families showed large C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions. Two additional families carried more than 30 repeats. Segregation with disease could be demonstrated in 3 families. One affected expansion carrier had neuropathology compatible with AD. In the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease Family Study series, the C9orf72 repeat expansions constituted the second most common pathogenic mutation, just behind the PSEN1 A79V mutation, highlighting the heterogeneity of clinical presentations associated with repeat expansions. C9orf72 repeat expansions explain a small proportion of patients with a clinical presentation indistinguishable from AD, and they highlight the necessity of screening frontotemporal dementia genes in clinical AD cases with strong family history.	4
Targeting the MAPK pathway in melanoma: why some approaches succeed and other fail. || Antineoplastic Agents Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms || The Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway plays a key role in melanoma development making it an important therapeutic target. In normal cells, the tightly regulated pathway relays extracellular signals from cell membrane to nucleus via a cascade of phosphorylation events. In melanomas, dysregulation of the MAPK pathway occurs frequently due to activating mutations in the B-RAF and RAS genes or other genetic or epigenetic modifications, leading to increased signaling activity promoting cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, migration, survival and angiogenesis. However, identification of ideal pathway member to therapeutically target for maximal clinical benefit to melanoma patients remains a challenge. This review provides an overview of the obstacles faced targeting the MAPK pathway and why certain therapeutic approaches succeed while others fail. The review summarizes the roles played by the proteins, therapeutic potential and the drugs available to target each member of the pathway as well as concerns related to each. Potential for targeting multiple points and inhibiting other pathways along with MAPK inhibition for optimal efficacy are discussed along with explanations for development of drug resistance, which includes discussions related to cross-talk between pathways, RAF kinase isoform switching and phosphatase deregulation. Finally, the use of nanotechnology is reviewed as an approach to target the MAPK pathway using both genetic and pharmacological agents simultaneously targeting multiple points in the pathway or in combination with other cascades.	0
p53: the attractive tumor suppressor in the cancer research field. || Animals Genes, p53 Humans Mice Mutation Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is one of the most studied tumor suppressors in the cancer research field. Of note, over 50% of human tumors carry loss of function mutations, and thus p53 has been considered to be a classical Knudson-type tumor suppressor. From the functional point of view, p53 is a nuclear transcription factor to transactivate a variety of its target genes implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptotic cell death. In response to cellular stresses such as DNA damage, p53 is activated and promotes cell cycle arrest followed by the replacement of DNA lesions and/or apoptotic cell death. Therefore, p53 is able to maintain the genomic integrity to prevent the accumulation of genetic alterations, and thus stands at a crossroad between cell survival and cell death. In this paper, we describe a variety of molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of p53.	0
Wild-type p53 oligomerizes more efficiently than p53 hot-spot mutants and overcomes mutant p53 gain-of-function via a "dominant-positive" mechanism. ||  || Human p53 protein acts as a transcription factor predominantly in a tetrameric form. Single residue changes, caused by hot-spot mutations of the TP53 gene in human cancer, transform wild-type (wt) p53 tumor suppressor proteins into potent oncoproteins - with gain-of-function, tumor-promoting activity. Oligomerization of p53 allows for a direct interplay between wt and mutant p53 proteins if both are present in the same cells - where a mutant p53's dominant-negative effect known to inactivate wt p53, co-exists with an opposite mechanism - a "dominant-positive" suppression of the mutant p53's gain-of-function activity by wt p53. In this study we determine the oligomerization efficiency of wt and mutant p53 in living cells using FRET-based assays and describe wt p53 to be more efficient than mutant p53 in entering p53 oligomers. The biased p53 oligomerization helps to interpret earlier reports of a low efficiency of the wt p53 inactivation via the dominant-negative effect, while it also implies that the "dominant-positive" effect may be more pronounced. Indeed, we show that at similar wt:mutant p53 concentrations in cells - the mutant p53 gain-of-function stimulation of gene transcription and cell migration is more efficiently inhibited than the wt p53's tumor-suppressive transactivation and suppression of cell migration. These results suggest that the frequent mutant p53 accumulation in human tumor cells does not only directly strengthen its gain-of-function activity, but also protects the oncogenic p53 mutants from the functional dominance of wt p53.	0
Mutation detection in Chinese patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the first molecularly and clinically characterized genetic disease of lipid metabolism. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with significantly elevated levels of total cholesterol and low density of lipoprotein cholesterol in serum, which would lead to extensive xanthomas and premature coronary heart disease. Mutations in low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR),proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 andApo lipoprotein B-100 (APOB) have been identified to be the underlying cause of this disease. Genetic testing and reports of the mutations in the Chinese population are still limited. In this study, 11 unrelated Chinese FH families were enrolled to detect the candidate gene variants by DNA direct sequencing. We identified 12 mutations (11 in LDLR and one inAPOB) in ten FH families. Three novelLDLR mutations (c.516C>A/p.D172E, c.1720C>A/p.R574S and c.760C>T/p.Q254X) were identified and co-segregated with the affected individuals in the families. Our discoveries not only further supports the significant role of LDLR in FH, but also expands the spectrum ofLDLR mutations. These new insights will contribute to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of FH patients.	4
The RASopathies: developmental syndromes of Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation. || Animals Germ-Line Mutation Humans Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Models, Biological Noonan Syndrome SOS1 Protein Signal Transduction Syndrome ras Proteins || The Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is essential in the regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation, growth and cell senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. It is therefore not surprising that its dysregulation has profound effects on development. A class of developmental syndromes, the 'RASopathies', is caused by germline mutations in genes that encode protein components of the Ras/MAPK pathway. The vast majority of these mutations result in increased signal transduction down the Ras/MAPK pathway, but usually to a lesser extent than somatic mutations associated with oncogenesis. Each syndrome exhibits unique phenotypic features, however, since they all cause dysregulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, there are numerous overlapping phenotypic features between the syndromes, including characteristic facial features, cardiac defects, cutaneous abnormalities, neurocognitive delay and a predisposition to malignancies. Here we review the clinical and underlying molecular basis for each of these syndromes.	0
Expanding the Phenotype of TRNT1-Related Immunodeficiency to Include Childhood Cataract and Inner Retinal Dysfunction. ||  || A multiorgan syndromic disorder characterized by sideroblastic anemia, immunodeficiency, periodic fever, and developmental delay with an uncharacterized retinal dystrophy is caused by TRNT1. This report of a family with a homozygous mutation in TRNT1 expands the ocular phenotype to include cataract and inner retinal dysfunction and details a mild systemic phenotype. A consanguineous family with 3 affected children was investigated. Key clinical features comprised hypogammaglobulinemia, short stature with microcephaly, cataract, and inner retinal dysfunction without sideroblastic anemia or developmental delay. Two siblings had poor balance and 1 sibling had sensorineural hearing loss. The oldest sibling had primary ovarian failure diagnosed at age 14.5 years. Exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense variant in TRNT1, c.295C>T (p.Arg99Trp) in all 3 patients. The sibling with hearing loss also harbored a homozygous mutation in GJB2, c.71G>A (p.Trp24*), which is an established cause of sensorineural hearing loss. This family expands the ocular and systemic phenotypes associated with mutations in TRNT1, demonstrating phenotypic variability and highlighting the need for ophthalmic review of these patients.	4
Molecular and phenotypic characteristics of patients with phenylketonuria in Serbia and Montenegro. || Genotype Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenotype Phenylketonurias Sequence Analysis, DNA Yugoslavia || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism in Caucasians. PKU is caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Here, we report the spectrum and the frequency of mutations in the PAH gene and discuss genotype-phenotype correlation in 34 unrelated patients with PKU from Serbia and Montenegro. Using both polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 'broad-range' denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis/DNA sequencing analysis, 19 disease-causing mutations were identified, corresponding to mutation detection rate of 97%. The most frequent ones were L48S (21%), R408W (18%), P281L (9%), E390G (7%) and R261Q (6%), accounting for 60% of all mutant alleles. The genotype-phenotype correlation was studied in homozygous and functionally hemizygous patients. We found that the most frequent mutation, L48S, was exclusively associated with the classical (severe) PKU phenotype. The mutation E390G gave rise to mild PKU. For the mutation R261Q, patients had been recorded in two phenotype categories. Considering allele frequencies, PKU in Serbia and Montenegro is heterogeneous, reflecting numerous migrations over the Balkan Peninsula.	1 3
Pathological hemichannels associated with human Cx26 mutations causing Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness syndrome. || Animals Biophysics Connexin 26 Connexins Cytoplasm Deafness Gap Junctions Humans Ichthyosis Keratitis Models, Biological Models, Chemical Models, Molecular Molecular Conformation Mutation Xenopus || Connexin (Cx) proteins form intercellular gap junction channels by first assembling into single membrane hemichannels that then dock to connect the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells. Gap junctions are highly specialized structures that allow the direct passage of small molecules between cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Functional activity of nonjunctional hemichannels has now been shown in several experimental systems. Hemichannels may constitute an important diffusional exchange pathway with the extracellular space, but the extent of their normal physiological role is currently unknown. Aberrant hemichannel activity has been linked to mutations of connexin proteins involved in genetic diseases. Here, we review a proposed role for hemichannels in the pathogenesis of Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness (KID) syndrome associated with connexin26 (Cx26) mutations. Continued functional evaluation of mutated hemichannels linked to human hereditary disorders may provide additional insights into the mechanisms governing their regulation in normal physiology and dysregulation in disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: The Communicating junctions, composition, structure and characteristics.	0
Why some tumours trigger neovascularisation and others don't: the story thus far. || Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Lung Neoplasms Neovascularization, Pathologic Sequence Analysis, DNA Signal Transduction Tissue Array Analysis Tumor Hypoxia Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A || Angiogenesis is not essential for tumours to develop and expand, as cancer can also grow in a non-angiogenic fashion, but why this type of growth occurs is unknown. Surprisingly, our data from mRNA transcription profiling did not show any differences in the classical angiogenic pathways, but differences were observed in mitochondrial metabolic pathways, suggesting a key role for metabolic reprogramming. We then validated these results with mRNA profiling by investigating differential protein expression via immunohistochemistry in angiogenic and non-angiogenic non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Immunohistochemical staining for 35 angiogenesis- and hypoxia-related biomarkers were performed on a collection of 194 angiogenic and 73 non-angiogenic NSCLCs arranged on tissue microarrays. Sequencing of P53 was performed with frozen tissue samples of NSCLC. The non-angiogenic tumours were distinguished from the angiogenic ones by having higher levels of proteins associated with ephrin pathways, mitochondria, cell biogenesis, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) regulation by oxygen and transcription of HIF-controlled genes but lower levels of proteins involved in the stroma, cell-cell signaling and adhesion, integrins, and Delta-Notch and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related signaling. However, proteins classically associated with angiogenesis were present in both types of tumours at very comparable levels. Cytoplasmic expression of P53 was strongly associated with non-angiogenic tumours. A pilot investigation showed that P53 mutations were observed in 32.0% of angiogenic cases but in 71.4% of non-angiogenic tumours. Our observations thus far indicate that both angiogenic and non-angiogenic tumours experience hypoxia/HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway protein expression in a comparable fashion. However, angiogenesis does not ensue in the non-angiogenic tumours. Surprisingly, metabolic reprogramming seems to distinguish these two types of neoplastic growth. On the basis of these results, we raise the hypothesis that in some, but not in all cases, initial tissue remodeling and/or inflammation could be one of the secondary steps necessary to trigger angiogenesis. In the non-angiogenic tumours, in which neovascularisation fails to occur, HIF pathway activation could be the driving force toward metabolic reprogramming.	0
Prevalence of PALB2 mutations in Australian familial breast cancer cases and controls. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Australia Breast Neoplasms Case-Control Studies Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Middle Aged Mutation Nuclear Proteins Prevalence Risk Tumor Suppressor Proteins Young Adult || PALB2 is emerging as a high-penetrance breast cancer predisposition gene in the order of BRCA1 and BRCA2. However, large studies that have evaluated the full gene rather than just the most common variants in both cases and controls are required before all truncating variants can be included in familial breast cancer variant testing. In this study we analyse almost 2000 breast cancer cases sourced from individuals referred to familial cancer clinics, thus representing typical cases presenting in clinical practice. These cases were compared to a similar number of population-based cancer-free controls. We identified a significant excess of truncating variants in cases (1.3 %) versus controls (0.2 %), including six novel variants (p = 0.0001; odds ratio (OR) 6.58, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.3-18.9). Three of the four control individuals carrying truncating variants had at least one relative with breast cancer. There was no excess of missense variants in cases overall, but the common c.1676A > G variant (rs152451) was significantly enriched in cases and may represent a low-penetrance polymorphism (p = 0.002; OR 1.24 (95 % CI 1.09-1.47). Our findings support truncating variants in PALB2 as high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility alleles, and suggest that a common missense variant may also lead to a low level of increased breast cancer risk.	4
Mutant p53 gain of function induces HER2 over-expression in cancer cells. || Acetylation Cell Line, Tumor Gain of Function Mutation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Histones Humans Promoter Regions, Genetic Receptor, ErbB-2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || HER2 over-expression is related with a poor prognosis in patients with invasive breast cancer tumors. Clinical associations have reported that somatic mutations of p53 more frequently detected in cases of sporadic breast cancer of the HER2 subtypes, besides a high percentage of HER2-amplifying tumors carry germline mutations of p53. The mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of oncogenic functions of p53 mutant proteins (mtp53), known as Gain of Function (GOF), over HER2 expression have not been reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate a possible relationship between p53 mutants and HER2 regulation. HER2 expression (transcription and protein), as well as HER2 protein stabilization have been evaluated after inducing or silencing of p53 mutants' expression in cell lines. Finally, we evaluated the interaction of the p53 mutants over the HER2 receptor promoter. Higher HER2 expression in cell lines harboring endogenous mtp53 compared with wt or null expression of p53 cell lines. Transfection of p53 mutants (R248Q and R273C) in cell lines increased the expression of HER2. Silencing of p53 mutants, decrease HER2 expression. The p53 mutants R248Q and R273C significantly increase the luciferase activity on the HER2 promoter, and both mutants also promote acetylation of H3 and H4 histones binding in it. These findings show for the first time that p53 mutants induce over-expression of HER2 at transcriptional level of the HER2 protein. Our results could have clinical implications in breast cancer and other types of cancer where HER2 is over-expressed and used as a therapy target.	0

The impact of p53 function on the metabolic activation of the carcinogenic air pollutant 3-nitrobenzanthrone and its metabolites 3-aminobenzanthrone and N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone in human cells. || Activation, Metabolic Air Pollutants Air Pollution Anthracenes Benz(a)Anthracenes Carcinogenesis Carcinogens, Environmental Cell Line, Tumor Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1 DNA Adducts DNA Damage HCT116 Cells Humans Inactivation, Metabolic Schiff Bases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vehicle Emissions || The tumour suppressor p53, encoded by TP53, is a key player in a wide network of signalling pathways. We investigated its role in the bioactivation of the environmental carcinogen 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA)found in diesel exhaust and its metabolites 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA) and N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone (N-OH-3-ABA) in a panel of isogenic human colorectal HCT116 cells differing only with respect to their TP53 status [i.e. TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-), TP53(-/-), TP53(R248W/+) or TP53(R248W/-)]. As a measure of metabolic competence, DNA adduct formation was determined using 32P-postlabelling. Wild-type (WT) p53 did not affect the bioactivation of 3-NBA; no difference in DNA adduct formation was observed in TP53(+/+), TP53(+/-) and TP53(-/-) cells. Bioactivation of both metabolites 3-ABA and N-OH-3-ABA on the other hand was WT-TP53 dependent. Lower 3-ABA- and N-OH-3-ABA-DNA adduct levels were found in TP53(+/-) and TP53(-/-) cells compared to TP53(+/+) cells, and p53's impact was attributed to differences in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 expression for 3-ABA whereas for N-OH-3-ABA, an impact of this tumour suppressor on sulphotransferase (SULT) 1A1/3 expression was detected. Mutant R248W-p53 protein function was similar to or exceeded the ability of WT-p53 in activating 3-NBA and its metabolites, measured as DNA adducts. However, identification of the xenobiotic-metabolising enzyme(s) (XMEs), through which mutant-p53 regulates these responses, proved difficult to decipher. For example, although both mutant cell lines exhibited higher CYP1A1 induction after 3-NBA treatment compared to TP53(+/+) cells, 3-NBA-derived DNA adduct levels were only higher in TP53(R248W/-) cells but not in TP53(R248W/+) cells. Our results show that p53's influence on carcinogen activation depends on the agent studied and thereby on the XMEs that mediate the bioactivation of that particular compound. The phenomenon of p53 regulating CYP1A1 expression in human cells is consistent with other recent findings; however, this is the first study highlighting the impact of p53 on sulphotransferase-mediated (i.e. SULT1A1) carcinogen metabolism in human cells.	0
The C-terminal domain of p53 orchestrates the interplay between non-covalent and covalent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 by PARP1. ||  || The post-translational modification poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) plays key roles in genome maintenance and transcription. Both non-covalent poly(ADP-ribose) binding and covalent PARylation control protein functions, however, it is unknown how the two modes of modification crosstalk mechanistically. Employing the tumor suppressor p53 as a model substrate, this study provides detailed insights into the interplay between non-covalent and covalent PARylation and unravels its functional significance in the regulation of p53. We reveal that the multifunctional C-terminal domain (CTD) of p53 acts as the central hub in the PARylation-dependent regulation of p53. Specifically, p53 bound to auto-PARylated PARP1 via highly specific non-covalent PAR-CTD interaction, which conveyed target specificity for its covalent PARylation by PARP1. Strikingly, fusing the p53-CTD to a protein that is normally not PARylated, renders this a target for covalent PARylation as well. Functional studies revealed that the p53-PAR interaction had substantial implications on molecular and cellular levels. Thus, PAR significantly influenced the complex p53-DNA binding properties and controlled p53 functions, with major implications on the p53-dependent interactome, transcription, and replication-associated recombination. Remarkably, this mechanism potentially also applies to other PARylation targets, since a bioinformatics analysis revealed that CTD-like regions are highly enriched in the PARylated proteome.	0
Case report: is low α-Gal enzyme activity sufficient to establish the diagnosis of Fabry disease? ||  || Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease due to alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) deficient activity which leads to the accumulation of glucoesphingolipids, such as globotriaosilceramide. There are over 700 known mutations of the enzyme gene, and most of them cause Fabry Disease. This case report describes a hemodialysis patient with a rare and controversial GLA gene mutation, the D313Y. The medecial investigation confirmed that D313Y is an alpha-galactosidase A sequence variant that causes pseudo deficient enzyme activity in plasma but not Fabry disease. Thus, clinical symptoms that prompted Fabry disease investigation could not be attributable to Fabry disease and therefore enzyme replacement therapy was not indicated.	3
Pathogenic variants for Mendelian and complex traits in exomes of 6,517 European and African Americans: implications for the return of incidental results. || African Americans Alleles Base Sequence Chromosome Mapping European Continental Ancestry Group Exome Genetic Variation Genome, Human Humans Macular Degeneration Models, Genetic Multifactorial Inheritance Sequence Analysis, DNA || Exome sequencing (ES) is rapidly being deployed for use in clinical settings despite limited empirical data about the number and types of incidental results (with potential clinical utility) that could be offered for return to an individual. We analyzed deidentified ES data from 6,517 participants (2,204 African Americans and 4,313 European Americans) from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project. We characterized the frequencies of pathogenic alleles in genes underlying Mendelian conditions commonly assessed by newborn-screening (NBS, n = 39) programs, genes associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD, n = 17), and genes known to influence drug response (PGx, n = 14). From these 70 genes, we identified 10,789 variants and curated them by manual review of OMIM, HGMD, locus-specific databases, or primary literature to a total of 399 validated pathogenic variants. The mean number of risk alleles per individual was 15.3. Every individual had at least five known PGx alleles, 99% of individuals had at least one ARMD risk allele, and 45% of individuals were carriers for at least one pathogenic NBS allele. The carrier burden for severe recessive childhood disorders was 0.57. Our results demonstrate that risk alleles of potential clinical utility for both Mendelian and complex traits are detectable in every individual. These findings highlight the necessity of developing guidelines and policies that consider the return of results to all individuals and underscore the need to develop innovative approaches and tools that enable individuals to exercise their choice about the return of incidental results.	4
Preferential binding of hot spot mutant p53 proteins to supercoiled DNA in vitro and in cells. || Binding Sites Cell Line, Tumor DNA, Superhelical Gene Expression Regulation Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Plasmids Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Substrate Specificity Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 bcl-2-Associated X Protein || Hot spot mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins exert oncogenic gain-of-function activities. Binding of mutp53 to DNA is assumed to be involved in mutp53-mediated repression or activation of several mutp53 target genes. To investigate the importance of DNA topology on mutp53-DNA recognition in vitro and in cells, we analyzed the interaction of seven hot spot mutp53 proteins with topologically different DNA substrates (supercoiled, linear and relaxed) containing and/or lacking mutp53 binding sites (mutp53BS) using a variety of electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation based techniques. All seven hot spot mutp53 proteins (R175H, G245S, R248W, R249S, R273C, R273H and R282W) were found to have retained the ability of wild-type p53 to preferentially bind circular DNA at native negative superhelix density, while linear or relaxed circular DNA was a poor substrate. The preference of mutp53 proteins for supercoiled DNA (supercoil-selective binding) was further substantiated by competition experiments with linear DNA or relaxed DNA in vitro and ex vivo. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, the preferential binding of mutp53 to a sc mutp53BS was detected also in cells. Furthermore, we have shown by luciferase reporter assay that the DNA topology influences p53 regulation of BAX and MSP/MST1 promoters. Possible modes of mutp53 binding to topologically constrained DNA substrates and their biological consequences are discussed.	0
Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of Chinese patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and BRAF mutation. || Adenocarcinoma Adult Aged Asian Continental Ancestry Group Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung China Disease-Free Survival Female Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Retrospective Studies Survival Analysis || BRAF mutation is one of the important driver oncogene in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data on Chinese patients with BRAF-mutant NSCLC are inadequate. Hence, we conducted this study to investigate the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of Chinese patients with NSCLC and BRAF mutations. We identified patients with BRAF-mutant NSCLC between January 2012 and April 2016. Patient characteristics and treatment outcomes were analyzed. In total, 1680 patients were included. Twenty-eight (1.7%) patients harbored BRAF mutations. Compared to patients with non-BRAF mutation, patients with BRAF mutations were associated with adenocarcinomas (89.3% vs. 70.6%, P = 0.048) and never smokers (78.6% vs. 56.7%, P = 0.019). There were no significant differences in the age, gender distribution, metastasis, or stage at first diagnosis between two groups. Response rates and progression-free survival (PFS) were similar between patient with BRAF mutations and EGFR (5.6 vs. 5.8 months; P = 0.277) or KRAS (5.6 vs. 4.7 months; P = 0.741) mutations to first-line chemotherapy. Compared to patients with non-V600E mutations, patients with V600E-mutated tumors had a shorter PFS to first-line chemotherapy, although this did not reach statistical significance (5.2 vs. 6.4 months; P = 0.561). In multivariate analyses, only ECOG PS remained the independent predictor of overall survival (HR = 0.208; P = 0.004). In conclusion, BRAF mutation in Chinese patients with NSCLC was rare. BRAF mutation is more likely to be associated with adenocarcinoma and never smokers. BRAF mutations are not associated with enhanced chemosensitivity and novel and effective drugs inhibiting the BRAF pathway are in urgent need.	4
A knowledge-based framework for the discovery of cancer-predisposing variants using large-scale sequencing breast cancer data. || Age Factors Alleles Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Case-Control Studies Epistasis, Genetic Female Gene Frequency Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genome-Wide Association Study Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Multifactorial Inheritance Mutation Workflow || The landscape of cancer-predisposing genes has been extensively investigated in the last 30 years with various methodologies ranging from candidate gene to genome-wide association studies. However, sequencing data are still poorly exploited in cancer predisposition studies due to the lack of statistical power when comparing millions of variants at once. To overcome these power limitations, we propose a knowledge-based framework founded on the characteristics of known cancer-predisposing variants and genes. Under our framework, we took advantage of a combination of previously generated datasets of sequencing experiments to identify novel breast cancer-predisposing variants, comparing the normal genomes of 673 breast cancer patients of European origin against 27,173 controls matched by ethnicity. We detected several expected variants on known breast cancer-predisposing genes, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 11 variants on genes associated with other cancer types, like RET and AKT1. Furthermore, we detected 183 variants that overlap with somatic mutations in cancer and 41 variants associated with 38 possible loss-of-function genes, including PIK3CB and KMT2C. Finally, we found a set of 19 variants that are potentially pathogenic, negatively correlate with age at onset, and have never been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of a genomic-driven approach nested in a classic case-control study to prioritize cancer-predisposing variants. In addition, we provide a resource containing variants that may affect susceptibility to breast cancer.	4
TP53 polymorphisms in sporadic North Indian breast cancer patients. ||  || The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential association of five (p.P47S, p.R72P, PIN3 Ins16bp, p.R213R and r.13494g>a) polymorphisms of TP53 with the risk of developing breast cancer in North Indian Punjabi population. We screened DNA samples of 200 sporadic breast cancer patients (197 females and 3 males) and 200 unrelated healthy, gender and age matched individuals for the polymorphisms. For the p.P47S polymorphism, we observed the PP genotype in 99.5% of the patients and PS genotype in only 1 patient. All the controls had the wild type PP genotype. The frequency of RR, RP and PP genotype of p.R72P was 23.5% vs 33.5%, 51.5% vs 45.5% and 25% vs 21% in patients and controls respectively. Heterozygous (RP) genotype was increased in breast cancer patients as compared to controls (51.5 vs 45.5%) and showed 1.61 fold significantly increased risk for breast cancer (OR=1.61, 95% CI, 1.01-2.58, p=0.04). In breast cancer patients the frequencies of A1A1, A1A2 and A2A2 genotypes of PIN3 Ins16bp polymorphism were 67%, 26% and 7% respectively whereas in controls the genotype frequencies were 68.5%, 27.5% and 4% respectively, with no significant difference. For p.R213R (c.639A>G), all individuals had homozygous wild type genotype. The frequencies of GG, GA and AA genotypes of TP53 r.13494g>a polymorphism were 62 vs 67.5%, 33 vs 28% and 5 vs 4.5% in patients and controls respectively, again without significant difference. We observed that RP- A1A1 genotype combination of p.R72P and PIN3 Ins16bp and RP-GG combination of p.R72P and r.13494g>a polymorphism showed significant risk of breast cancer (OR=1.65, 95%CI: 0.98-2.78, p=0.05; OR=1.72, 95%CI: 1.01-2.92, p=0.04). The results of present study indicated that among the five TP53 polymorphisms investigated, the p.R72P polymorphism, and the RP-A1A1 and RP-GG genotype combination contribute to breast cancer susceptibility in North Indians.	4

The aim of this multicentric study was to assess frequency and type of oncogenic BRAF/NRAS/KIT mutations in MUP with clinically detected nodal metastases in relation to clinicopathologic features and outcome. We analyzed series of 103 MUP patients (period: 1992-2010) after therapeutic lymphadenectomy (LND): 40 axillary, 47 groin, 16 cervical, none treated with BRAF inhibitors. We performed molecular characterization of BRAF/NRAS/KIT mutational status in nodal metastases using direct sequencing of respective coding sequences. Median follow-up time was 53 months. BRAF mutations were detected in 55 cases (53 %) (51 V600E, 93 %; 4 others, 7 %), and mutually exclusive NRAS mutations were found in 14 cases (14 %) (7 p.Q61R, 4 p.Q61K, 2 p.Q61H, 1 p.Q13R). We have not detected any mutations in KIT. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 34 %; median was 24 months. We have not found significant correlation between mutational status (BRAF/NRAS) and OS; however, for BRAF or NRAS mutated melanomas we observed significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) when compared with wild-type melanoma patients (p = .04; 5-year DFS, 18 vs 19 vs 31 %, respectively). The most important factor influencing OS was number of metastatic lymph nodes >1 (p = .03). Our large study on molecular characterization of MUP with nodal metastases showed that MUPs had molecular features similar to sporadic non-chronic-sun-damaged melanomas. BRAF/NRAS mutational status had negative impact on DFS in this group of patients. These observations might have potential implication for molecular-targeted therapy in MUPs.	4

KRAS G12D mosaic mutation in a Chinese linear nevus sebaceous syndrome infant. || Amino Acid Substitution Epilepsy Exons Eye Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Mutation Nevus, Sebaceous of Jadassohn Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Skin || Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS) is a multisystem disorder that includes nevus sebaceous and central nervous system, ocular and skeletal anomalies. We report the first case of a KRAS G12D mosaic mutation in a patient diagnosed with LNSS. A 3-month-old female with a clinical diagnosis of LNSS presented with intermittent epilepsy. Her mother carefully collected a skin lesion sample from scratched-off scurf obtained from the patient's nails. DNA was extracted, and long-range PCR was performed to amplify the KRAS gene, which was then analyzed by next-generation sequencing. The results revealed the presence of a low-level heterozygous mutation in the KRAS gene (c.35C>T; p.G12D, 5 %). These findings suggest that the KRAS somatic mosaic mutation in this patient may have caused her skin and eye lesions and epilepsy. With this correct diagnosis, the infant can be effectively treated.	4
Clinical Genetic Testing for the Cardiomyopathies and Arrhythmias: A Systematic Framework for Establishing Clinical Validity and Addressing Genotypic and Phenotypic Heterogeneity. ||  || Advances in DNA sequencing have made large, diagnostic gene panels affordable and efficient. Broad adoption of such panels has begun to deliver on the promises of personalized medicine, but has also brought new challenges such as the presence of unexpected results, or results of uncertain clinical significance. Genetic analysis of inherited cardiac conditions is particularly challenging due to the extensive genetic heterogeneity underlying cardiac phenotypes, and the overlapping, variable, and incompletely penetrant nature of their clinical presentations. The design of effective diagnostic tests and the effective use of the results depend on a clear understanding of the relationship between each gene and each considered condition. To address these issues, we developed simple, systematic approaches to three fundamental challenges: (1) evaluating the strength of the evidence suggesting that a particular condition is caused by pathogenic variants in a particular gene, (2) evaluating whether unusual genotype/phenotype observations represent a plausible expansion of clinical phenotype associated with a gene, and (3) establishing a molecular diagnostic strategy to capture overlapping clinical presentations. These approaches focus on the systematic evaluation of the pathogenicity of variants identified in clinically affected individuals, and the natural history of disease in those individuals. Here, we applied these approaches to the evaluation of more than 100 genes reported to be associated with inherited cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, Brugada, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and to a set of related syndromes such as Noonan Syndrome and Fabry disease. These approaches provide a framework for delivering meaningful and accurate genetic test results to individuals with hereditary cardiac conditions.	4
Ultrastructure of the hair in genetic prelingual deafness associated with the 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2). || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Hair Homozygote Humans Microscopy, Electron, Scanning Mutation || Ultrastructure of the surface of long hair in 77 subjects with a phenotype of childhood prelingual deafness was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. The subjects were homozygous or heterozygous carriers of the 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2). The presence of severe abnormalities in the marginal layer of the cuticular plate (fracture-like defects) is pathognomonic for homozygous carriers of the 35delG mutation. Ultrastructural characteristics of the hair in subjects with connexin-associated deafness significantly differed from those in healthy volunteers (control group of the same age) and deaf people with non-genetic hearing impairment. Analysis of variance revealed no differences in hair thickness between deaf homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the 35delG GJB2 gene mutation and healthy volunteers.	4
Activation of p53 Facilitates the Target Search in DNA by Enhancing the Target Recognition Probability. || Binding Sites DNA Mutation Probability Protein Binding Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor suppressor p53 binds to the target in a genome and regulates the expression of downstream genes. p53 searches for the target by combining three-dimensional diffusion and one-dimensional sliding along the DNA. To examine the regulation mechanism of the target binding, we constructed the pseudo-wild type (pseudo-WT), activated (S392E), and inactive (R248Q) mutants of p53 and observed their target binding in long DNA using single-molecule fluorescence imaging. The pseudo-WT sliding along the DNA showed many pass events over the target and possessed target recognition probability (TRP) of 7±2%. The TRP increased to 18±2% for the activated mutant but decreased to 0% for the inactive mutant. Furthermore, the fraction of the target binding by the one-dimensional sliding among the total binding events increased from 63±9% for the pseudo-WT to 87±2% for the activated mutant. Control of TRP upon activation, as demonstrated here for p53, might be a general activation mechanism of transcription factors.	0

A pediatric case of Brugada syndrome diagnosed by fever-provoked ventricular tachycardia. || Brugada syndrome Child Fever Retinoblastoma Ventricular tachycardia || Brugada syndrome is a rare channelopathy associated with the SCN5A gene that causes fatal ventricular arrhythmias. This case of Brugada syndrome, in which ventricular tachycardia (VT) was provoked by high fever, is the first report in a Korean child. The boy had retinoblastoma of his left eye diagnosed at 16 months of age. After chemotherapy, he contracted a catheter-related infection with a high fever up to 41℃ leading to monomorphic VT. This was characterized as having right bundle branch block morphology, superior axis deviation, and a heart rate of 212/min. Direct current cardioversion recovered the VT to sinus rhythm after a lack of response to amiodarone and lidocaine. A second attack of VT that was not controlled by cardioversion, however, responded to lidocaine. The baseline electrocardiogram showed a long PR interval and QRS duration, and the patient's grandfather had a history of Brugada syndrome. A mutation in SCN5A was identified in this patient, his father, and his grandfather. The patient was treated with quinidine and followed up for 1 year.	4
GJB2 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA susceptibility mutations in sudden deafness. || Adult Case-Control Studies Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genes, Mitochondrial Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sudden Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Mitochondria Mutation Phylogeny Polymorphism, Genetic RNA, Ribosomal || Genetic susceptibility may play an important role in the pathogenesis of sudden deafness. However, the specific genes involved are largely unknown. We sought to explore the frequency of GJB2 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA susceptibility mutations in patients with sudden deafness. Between September 2011 and May 2012, 62 consecutive patients with sudden deafness were seen. In 50 of these, no etiological factors for sudden deafness were found. We detected GJB2 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA variants by direct sequencing in these 50 patients and in 53-aged matched controls with normal hearing. In addition, we undertook functional analyses of the mitochondrial mutations which we detected, applying structural and phylogenetic analysis. GJB2 sequencing identified six mutations, including three pathogenic mutations (c.235delC, c.299-300delAT, c.109G>A) and three polymorphisms, in the study participants, giving an allele frequency of 15.0 %. A homozygous c.109G>A mutation was detected in two participants. A total of 16 variants in mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene were identified in the participants. No significant differences were found in GJB2 heterozygosity or in mitochondrial 12S rRNA variants between patients with sudden deafness and in controls. Our results suggest that the homozygous GJB2 c.109G>A mutation may be a cause of sudden deafness involving both ears. This finding should increase awareness of the likely role of genetic factors in the etiology of sudden deafness in general.	4
EphA2 Expression Is a Key Driver of Migration and Invasion and a Poor Prognostic Marker in Colorectal Cancer. || Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Colorectal Neoplasms Gene Expression Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Receptor, EphA2 Reproducibility of Results Signal Transduction ral GTP-Binding Proteins ral Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor ras Proteins || EphA2, a member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases family, is an important regulator of tumor initiation, neovascularization, and metastasis in a wide range of epithelial and mesenchymal cancers; however, its role in colorectal cancer recurrence and progression is unclear. EphA2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in stage II/III colorectal tumors (N = 338), and findings correlated with clinical outcome. The correlation between EphA2 expression and stem cell markers CD44 and Lgr5 was examined. The role of EphA2 in migration/invasion was assessed using a panel of KRAS wild-type (WT) and mutant (MT) parental and invasive colorectal cancer cell line models. Colorectal tumors displayed significantly higher expression levels of EphA2 compared with matched normal tissue, which positively correlated with high CD44 and Lgr5 expression levels. Moreover, high EphA2 mRNA and protein expression were found to be associated with poor overall survival in stage II/III colorectal cancer tissues, in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Preclinically, we found that EphA2 was highly expressed in KRASMT colorectal cancer cells and that EphA2 levels are regulated by the KRAS-driven MAPK and RalGDS-RalA pathways. Moreover, EphA2 levels were elevated in several invasive daughter cell lines, and downregulation of EphA2 using RNAi or recombinant EFNA1 suppressed migration and invasion of KRASMT colorectal cancer cells. These data show that EpHA2 is a poor prognostic marker in stage II/III colorectal cancer, which may be due to its ability to promote cell migration and invasion, providing support for the further investigation of EphA2 as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.	0
Comparison between two amplicon-based sequencing panels of different scales in the detection of somatic mutations associated with gastric cancer. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Stomach Neoplasms || Sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium and other research institutes have revealed the presence of genetic alterations in several tumor types, including gastric cancer. These data have been combined into a catalog of significantly mutated genes for each cancer type. However, it is unclear to what extent significantly mutated genes need to be examined for detecting genetic alterations in gastric cancer patients. Here, we constructed two custom-made sequencing panels of different scales, the Selective hotspot Panel and the Comprehensive Panel, to analyze genetic alterations in 21 resected specimens endoscopically obtained from 20 gastric cancer patients, and we assessed how many mutations were detectable using these different panels. A total of 21 somatic mutations were identified by the Selective hotspot Panel and 70 mutations were detected by the Comprehensive Panel. All mutations identified by the Selective hotspot Panel were detected by the Comprehensive Panel, with high concordant values of the variant allelic fraction of each mutation (correlation coefficient, R = 0.92). At least one mutation was identified in 13 patients (65 %) by the Selective hotspot Panel, whereas the Comprehensive Panel detected mutations in 19 (95 %) patients. Library preparation and sequencing costs were comparable between the two panels. Our results indicate the utility of comprehensive panel-based targeted sequencing in gastric cancer.	4
[Progressive hearing impairment with deletion in GJB2 gene despite normal newborn hearing screening]. ||  || Hearing impairment is the most common sensorineural disease in humans. About 1-3 per 1 000 neonates suffers at birth or in the first years from high-grade to severe hearing impairment. About half of the cases are due to genetic alterations. Most commonly, the GJB2 gene (connexin-26) is concerned with the mutation c.35delG. MATERIAL AND METHODES: All patients showed a severe to profound hearing impairment to the course. DNA isolation, amplification and sequencing was performed using standard techniques. In the studied patient population we have 142 pa-tients with a homozygous deletion mutation in GJB2 gene (c.35delG) and 29 patients who are heterozygous for this mutation on one allele and heterozygous for another loss-of-function mutation in GJB2 gene. Of these 171 patients were 16 (9.3%) on an inconspicuous newborn hearing screening using Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE). Total was observed a progression of hearing impairment in 31 of these patients (18.1%). This fact suggests that homozygous deletion mutation c.35delG does not always contribute to an congenital hearing impairment, but to a progressive hearing loss that might develop over the first months and years of life. Additionally, we have to re-evaluate the value of OAE for newborn hearing screening, keeping in mind that one positive result is no warranty for a normal development of hearing function, but a result that should be checked in the course. We recommend annual hearing tests to the paediatrician and with a known familial hearing loss and other risk factors pedaudiological controls.	4
Connexin 26: required for normal auditory function. || Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Frameshift Mutation Gap Junctions Hearing Humans || A single base deletion mutation, 35delG, in the gene (GJB2/DFNB1)(OMIM 121011/220290) encoding the gap junction protein, connexin 26 is the most important single cause of genetic hearing loss in European and American populations. It is the cause of one of the most common human genetic disorders with a frequency similar to cystic fibrosis. Mutations in this connexin are associated with skin disorders.	4
The Expression Levels of XLF and Mutant P53 Are Inversely Correlated in Head and Neck Cancer Cells. ||  || XRCC4-like factor (XLF), also known as Cernunnos, is a protein encoded by the human NHEJ1 gene and an important repair factor for DNA double-strand breaks. In this study, we have found that XLF is over-expressed in HPV(+) versus HPV(-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and significantly down-regulated in the HNSCC cell lines expressing high level of mutant p53 protein versus those cell lines harboring wild-type TP53 gene with low p53 protein expression. We have also demonstrated that Werner syndrome protein (WRN), a member of the NHEJ repair pathway, binds to both mutant p53 protein and NHEJ1 gene promoter, and siRNA knockdown of WRN leads to the inhibition of XLF expression in the HNSCC cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that WRN and p53 are involved in the regulation of XLF expression and the activity of WRN might be affected by mutant p53 protein in the HNSCC cells with aberrant TP53 gene mutations, due to the interaction of mutant p53 with WRN. As a result, the expression of XLF in these cancer cells is significantly suppressed. Our study also suggests that XLF is over-expressed in HPV(+) HNSCC with low expression of wild type p53, and might serve as a potential biomarker for HPV(+) HNSCC. Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms underlying the interactive role of WRN and XLF in NHEJ repair pathway.	0
Molecular profiling of advanced solid tumors and patient outcomes with genotype-matched clinical trials: the Princess Margaret IMPACT/COMPACT trial. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Canada DNA, Neoplasm Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Young Adult || The clinical utility of molecular profiling of tumor tissue to guide treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors is unknown. Our objectives were to evaluate the frequency of genomic alterations, clinical "actionability" of somatic variants, enrollment in mutation-targeted or other clinical trials, and outcome of molecular profiling for advanced solid tumor patients at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM). Patients with advanced solid tumors aged ≥18 years, good performance status, and archival tumor tissue available were prospectively consented. DNA from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was tested using a MALDI-TOF MS hotspot panel or a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Somatic variants were classified according to clinical actionability and an annotated report included in the electronic medical record. Oncologists were provided with summary tables of their patients' molecular profiling results and available mutation-specific clinical trials. Enrolment in genotype-matched versus genotype-unmatched clinical trials following release of profiling results and response by RECIST v1.1 criteria were evaluated. From March 2012 to July 2014, 1893 patients were enrolled and 1640 tested. After a median follow-up of 18 months, 245 patients (15 %) who were tested were subsequently treated on 277 therapeutic clinical trials, including 84 patients (5 %) on 89 genotype-matched trials. The overall response rate was higher in patients treated on genotype-matched trials (19 %) compared with genotype-unmatched trials (9 %; p < 0.026). In a multi-variable model, trial matching by genotype (p = 0.021) and female gender (p = 0.034) were the only factors associated with increased likelihood of treatment response. Few advanced solid tumor patients enrolled in a prospective institutional molecular profiling trial were treated subsequently on genotype-matched therapeutic trials. In this non-randomized comparison, genotype-enrichment of early phase clinical trials was associated with an increased objective tumor response rate.

Preferred binding of gain-of-function mutant p53 to bidirectional promoters with coordinated binding of ETS1 and GABPA to multiple binding sites. || Binding Sites Cell Line, Tumor DNA, Neoplasm GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor Gene Expression Humans Lung Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1 Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Gain-of-function mutant p53 is thought to induce gene expression in part by binding transcription factors bound to promoters for genes that mediate oncogenesis. We investigated the mechanism of mutant p53 binding by mapping the human genomic binding sites for p53 R273H using ChIP-Seq and showed them to localize to ETS DNA sequence motifs and locations with ETS1 and GABPA binding, both within promoters and distal to promoters. Strikingly, p53 R273H showed statistically significant and substantial binding to bidirectional promoters, which are enriched for inverted repeated ETS DNA sequence motifs. p53 R273H exhibited an exponential increase in probability of binding promoters with a higher number of ETS motifs. Both ETS1 and GABPA also showed an increase in the probability of binding to promoters with a higher number of ETS motifs. However, despite this increase in probability of binding by p53 R273H and ETS1, there was no increase in the binding signal, suggesting that the number of ETS1 and p53 R273H proteins bound per promoter is being limited. In contrast, GABPA did exhibit an increase in binding signal with higher numbers of ETS motifs per promoter. Analysis of the distance between inverted pairs of ETS motifs within promoters and binding by p53 R273H, ETS1 and GABPA, showed a novel coordination of binding for the three proteins. Both ETS1 and p53 R273H exhibited preference for binding promoters with distantly spaced ETS motifs in face-to-face and back-to-back orientations, and low binding preference to promoters with closely spaced ETS motifs. GABPA exhibited the inverse pattern of binding by preferring to bind promoters with closely spaced ETS motifs. Analysis of the helical phase between ETS motifs showed that ETS1 and p53 R273H exhibited a low preference for binding promoters with ETS motifs on the same face of the DNA helix. We propose a model for the binding of ETS1 and p53 R273H in which two inverted ETS motifs on a looped DNA helix are juxtaposed for ETS1 binding as a homodimer, with p53 R273H bound to ETS1. We propose that the formation of this DNA loop and protein-bound complex prevents additional binding of ETS1 and p53 R273H proteins to other proximal binding sites.	0
Prevalence and nature of connexin 26 mutations in children with non-syndromic deafness. || Adolescent Australia Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Infant Mutation Phenotype Prevalence Severity of Illness Index || To determine (1) the prevalence and nature of connexin 26 mutations in a cohort of Australian children with non-syndromic hearing loss, and (2) the carrier frequency of the common connexin 26 mutation (35delG) in the general population. A cohort, case-finding study. Mutation analysis was performed on DNA extracted from white blood cells, buccal cells, or Guthrie blood spots. A hearing loss investigation clinic and a deafness centre in two Australian capital cities, 1 January 1998 to 31 October 2000. (1) 243 children (age range, 4 weeks to 16 years; median, 4 years), attending hearing loss clinics in Sydney and Melbourne; (2) 1000 blood samples obtained from anonymous Guthrie card blood spots collected in 1984 [corrected] by the Victorian Clinical Genetics Service as part of the newborn screening program. (1) The prevalence and types of connexin 26 mutations in a cohort of children with prelingual deafness; (2) the carrier frequency of the common connexin 26 mutation, 35delG, in the general population. Connexin 26 mutations were identified and characterised in 52 (21%) of the 243 children; 14 different mutations, including four previously unreported mutations (135S, C53R, T123N and R127C), were identified. The common 35delG mutation was found in 56 of the 104 alleles (ie, 86 of the connexin 26 alleles in which a mutation was positively identified). The mutations V371 and M34T were also relatively common. The carrier frequency of connexin 26 mutations and of the common 35delG connexin 26 mutation in the Victorian population was estimated to be 1 in 54 and 1 in 100, respectively. Mutations in the connexin 26 gene (especially the 35delG mutation) are a common cause of prelingual hearing loss in Australia.	4
Protein-altering variants associated with body mass index implicate pathways that control energy intake and expenditure in obesity. ||  || Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >250 loci for body mass index (BMI), implicating pathways related to neuronal biology. Most GWAS loci represent clusters of common, noncoding variants from which pinpointing causal genes remains challenging. Here we combined data from 718,734 individuals to discover rare and low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%) coding variants associated with BMI. We identified 14 coding variants in 13 genes, of which 8 variants were in genes (ZBTB7B, ACHE, RAPGEF3, RAB21, ZFHX3, ENTPD6, ZFR2 and ZNF169) newly implicated in human obesity, 2 variants were in genes (MC4R and KSR2) previously observed to be mutated in extreme obesity and 2 variants were in GIPR. The effect sizes of rare variants are ~10 times larger than those of common variants, with the largest effect observed in carriers of an MC4R mutation introducing a stop codon (p.Tyr35Ter, MAF = 0.01%), who weighed ~7 kg more than non-carriers. Pathway analyses based on the variants associated with BMI confirm enrichment of neuronal genes and provide new evidence for adipocyte and energy expenditure biology, widening the potential of genetically supported therapeutic targets in obesity.	4
Frequency of GJB2 mutations in patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss from an ethnically characterized Brazilian population. || Adolescent Adult Brazil Child Child, Preschool Connexins Deafness Female Gene Frequency Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || In different parts of the world, mutations in the GJB2 gene are associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, and the homozygous 35delG mutation (p.Gly12Valfs*2) is a major cause of hereditary hearing loss. However, the 35delG mutation is not equally prevalent across ethnicities, making it important to study other mutations, especially in multiethnic countries such as Brazil. This study aimed to identify different mutations in the GJB2 gene in patients with severe to profound nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss of putative genetic origin, and who were negative or heterozygote for the 35delG mutation. Observational study that analyzed 100 ethnically characterized Brazilian patients with nonsyndromic severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, who were negative or heterozygote for the 35delG mutation. GJB2 mutations were detected by DNA-based sequencing in this population. Participants' ethnicities were identified as Latin European, Non-Latin European, Jewish, Native, Turkish, Afro-American, Asian and Others. Sixteen participants were heterozygote for the 35delG mutation; 14 participants, including three 35delG heterozygote's, had nine different alterations in the GJB2 gene. One variant, p.Ser199Glnfs*9, detected in two participants, was previously unreported. Three variants were pathogenic (p.Trp172*, p.Val167Met, and p.Arg75Trp), two were non-pathogenic (p.Val27Ile and p.Ile196Thr), and three variants were indeterminate (p.Met34Thr, p.Arg127Leu, and p.Lys168Arg). Three cases of compound heterozygosity were detected: p.[(Gly12Valfs*2)];[(Trp172*)], p.[(Gly12Valfs*2)](;)[(Met34Thr)], and p.[(Gly12Valfs*2)(;)[(Ser199Glnfs*9)]). This study detected previously unclassified variants and one case of previously unreported compound heterozygosity.	4
Genotype-predicted tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-responsiveness and molecular genetics in Croatian patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Biopterin Child Child, Preschool Croatia European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genotype Humans Infant Male Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase || Specific mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), located on chromosome 12q22-24.1, are linked to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4; sapropterin)-responsive phenylketonuria (PKU). Diagnosis is usually done through the newborn screening for PKU, followed by a BH4 loading test. So far, more than 60 mutant alleles, presenting with a substantial residual PAH activity (average approximately 47%), were identified in more than 500 patients worldwide. We investigated the predictive value of BH4-responsive PAH mutations in Croatian population. From a group of 127 PKU patients, 62 were selected (based on the genotype) as potentially BH4-responsive and 39 loaded with BH4 (20 mg/kg). The overall frequency of BH4-responsiveness (>30% blood phenylalanine reduction within 24 h) was 36% (14 out of 39 patients with 23 different genotypes), significantly less than expected. The best responders were patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (4/4; 100%), followed by mild PKU (8/9; 89%), and classical PKU (2/26; 8%). The most common BH(4)-responsive genotypes were p.E390G/p.R408W and p.P281L/p.E390G. These genotypes correspond for approximately >30% residual PAH activity. The p.E390G mutation was 100% associated with BH4-responsiveness, regardless of the second allele (p.R408W, p.P281L, p.F55Lfs, p.L249P). With regard to the predicted relative PAH activity of recombinantly expressed mutant alleles, there was a significant (p<0.002) difference between BH4-responders and non-responders. In a general Croatian PKU population, disease-causing mutations were identified on 226 alleles (99%). There were 35 different mutations: 21 missense, 8 splice site, 3 nonsense, 2 single nucleotide deletions, and 1 in-frame deletion. Four mutations are reported for the first time: p.E76D, p.L333P, p.G346E, and IVS8-2A>G. Five mutations accounted for over two-thirds of investigated alleles: p.L48S, p.R261Q, p.P281L, p.E390G, and p.R408W. Thus, the Croatian PKU population seems to be more homogenous than some other Mediterranean or Central European populations. This study reveals the importance of a full genotype for the prediction of BH4-responsiveness. In contrast to previous assumption and with exception of the p.E390G mutation, single allele mutations are not reliable for the selection of potential PKU candidates for pharmacological therapy with BH4.	1 3
Immunohistochemistry is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Sensitivity and Specificity Skin Neoplasms Young Adult || Testing for NRAS is now integral part in the assessment of metastatic melanoma patients because there is evidence that NRAS-mutated patients may be sensitive to MEK inhibitors, and RAS mutation is a common mechanism of acquired resistance during treatment with BRAF inhibitors. This study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemical analysis using an N-Ras (Q61R) antibody to detect the presence of the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma patients. A total of 98 primary cutaneous melanomas that have undergone examination of NRAS mutation were retrieved from a multicentric database. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded melanoma tissues were analyzed for BRAF and NRAS mutations by independent, blinded observers using both conventional DNA molecular techniques and immunohistochemistry with the novel anti-human N-Ras (Q61R) monoclonal antibody (clone SP174). The antibody showed a sensitivity of 100% (14/14) and a specificity of 100% (83/83) for detecting the presence of an NRASQ61R mutation. Of the NRAS-mutated cases, none of the non-Q61R cases stained positive with the antibody (0/7). There were three cases with discordant NRAS mutational results. Additional molecular analysis confirmed the immunohistochemically obtained NRAS result in all cases, suggesting that a multiple analytical approach can be required to reach the correct sample classification. The reported immunohistochemical method is an accurate, rapid, and cost-effective method for detecting NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma patients, and represents a valuable supplement to traditional mutation testing. If validated in further studies, genetic testing would only be required for immunohistochemistry-negative patients to detect non-Q61R mutations.	4
Discovery of a novel noniminosugar acid α glucosidase chaperone series. || Blotting, Western Cells, Cultured Drug Discovery Enzyme Replacement Therapy Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Imino Sugars Immunohistochemistry Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Microscopy, Confocal Molecular Chaperones Small Molecule Libraries Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization Structure-Activity Relationship alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA). Many disease-causing mutated GAA retain enzymatic activity but are not translocated from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to lysosomes. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only treatment for Pompe disease but remains expensive, inconvenient, and does not reverse all disease manifestations. It was postulated that small molecules which aid in protein folding and translocation to lysosomes could provide an alternate to ERT. Previously, several iminosugars have been proposed as small-molecule chaperones for specific LSDs. Here we identified a novel series of noniminosugar chaperones for GAA. These moderate GAA inhibitors are shown to bind and thermostabilize GAA and increase GAA translocation to lysosomes in both wild-type and Pompe fibroblasts. AMDE and physical properties studies indicate that this series is a promising lead for further pharmacokinetic evaluation and testing in Pompe disease models.	1
A novel approach using long-read sequencing and ddPCR to investigate gonadal mosaicism and estimate recurrence risk in two families with developmental disorders. || DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Male Mandibulofacial Dysostosis Mosaicism Noonan Syndrome Nuclear Proteins Phosphoproteins Pregnancy Preimplantation Diagnosis Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Risk Assessment || De novo mutations contribute significantly to severe early-onset genetic disorders. Even if the mutation is apparently de novo, there is a recurrence risk due to parental germ line mosaicism, depending on in which gonadal generation the mutation occurred. We demonstrate the power of using SMRT sequencing and ddPCR to determine parental origin and allele frequencies of de novo mutations in germ cells in two families whom had undergone assisted reproduction. In the first family, a TCOF1 variant c.3156C>T was identified in the proband with Treacher Collins syndrome. The variant affects splicing and was determined to be of paternal origin. It was present in <1% of the paternal germ cells, suggesting a very low recurrence risk. In the second family, the couple had undergone several unsuccessful pregnancies where a de novo mutation PTPN11 c.923A>C causing Noonan syndrome was identified. The variant was present in 40% of the paternal germ cells suggesting a high recurrence risk. Our findings highlight a successful strategy to identify the parental origin of mutations and to investigate the recurrence risk in couples that have undergone assisted reproduction with an unknown donor or in couples with gonadal mosaicism that will undergo preimplantation genetic diagnosis.	4
Long term enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease: effectiveness on kidney, heart and brain. || Adolescent Adult Brain Cohort Studies Enzyme Replacement Therapy Fabry Disease Female Heart Humans Kidney Kidney Function Tests Male Organ Size || Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A deficiency leading to renal, cardiac, cerebrovascular disease and premature death. Treatment with α-galactosidase A (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT) stabilises disease in some patients, but long term effectiveness is unclear. Renal, cardiac, and cerebral outcomes were prospectively studied in males and females with Fabry disease treated with ERT. Additionally, the occurrence of major cardiac events, stroke, end-stage renal disease and death was compared to a natural history (NH) cohort meeting treatment criteria. Of 75 patients on ERT (median treatment duration 5.2 years, range 0.05-11.0), prospective follow-up was available for 57 adult patients (30 males) and 6 adolescents. Renal function declined in males (-3.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year, SE 0.2; p < 0.001) despite ERT, but followed the normal course in females (-0.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 per year, SE 0.3; p = 0.001). Cardiac mass increased during ERT in males (+ 1.2 gram/m2.7, SE 0.3; p < 0.001), but remained stable in females (-0.3 gram/m2.7 per year, SE 0.4; p = 0.52). ERT did not prevent the occurrence of cerebral white matter lesions. Comparison of ERT treated to untreated patients revealed that the odds to develop a first complication increased with age (OR 1.05 (95% CI: 1.0-1.1) per year, p = 0.012). For development of a first or second complication the odds declined with longer treatment duration (OR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68-0.96) per year of ERT, p = 0.015;OR 0.52 (0.31-0.88), p = 0.014 respectively). Long term ERT does not prevent disease progression, but the risk of developing a first or second complication declines with increasing treatment duration. ERT in advanced Fabry disease seems of doubtful benefit.	3
Molecular genetics analysis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients in India. ||  || Hereditary cancers account for 5-10% of cancers. In this study BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2*(1100delC) were analyzed for mutations in 91 HBOC/HBC/HOC families and early onset breast and early onset ovarian cancer cases. PCR-DHPLC was used for mutation screening followed by DNA sequencing for identification and confirmation of mutations. Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were computed for five-year survival data on Breast and Ovarian cancer cases separately, and differences were tested using the Log-rank test. Fifteen (16%) pathogenic mutations (12 in BRCA1 and 3 in BRCA2), of which six were novel BRCA1 mutations were identified. None of the cases showed CHEK2*1100delC mutation. Many reported polymorphisms in the exonic and intronic regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were also seen. The mutation status and the polymorphisms were analyzed for association with the clinico-pathological features like age, stage, grade, histology, disease status, survival (overall and disease free) and with prognostic molecular markers (ER, PR, c-erbB2 and p53). The stage of the disease at diagnosis was the only statistically significant (p < 0.0035) prognostic parameter. The mutation frequency and the polymorphisms were similar to reports on other ethnic populations. The lack of association between the clinico-pathological variables, mutation status and the disease status is likely to be due to the small numbers.	4
Genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease confer different cerebral cortex cell-type population structure. || Adult Age of Onset Aged, 80 and over Alleles Alzheimer Disease Apolipoprotein E4 Astrocytes Cerebral Cortex Demography Female Genetic Variation Humans Male Membrane Glycoproteins Middle Aged Nerve Degeneration Neurons Receptors, Immunologic Reproducibility of Results Sequence Analysis, RNA Transcriptome || Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal loss and astrocytosis in the cerebral cortex. However, the specific effects that pathological mutations and coding variants associated with AD have on the cellular composition of the brain are often ignored. We developed and optimized a cell-type-specific expression reference panel and employed digital deconvolution methods to determine brain cellular distribution in three independent transcriptomic studies. We found that neuronal and astrocyte relative proportions differ between healthy and diseased brains and also among AD cases that carry specific genetic risk variants. Brain carriers of pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 presented lower neuron and higher astrocyte relative proportions compared to sporadic AD. Similarly, the APOE ε4 allele also showed decreased neuronal and increased astrocyte relative proportions compared to AD non-carriers. In contrast, carriers of variants in TREM2 risk showed a lower degree of neuronal loss compared to matched AD cases in multiple independent studies. These findings suggest that genetic risk factors associated with AD etiology have a specific imprinting in the cellular composition of AD brains. Our digital deconvolution reference panel provides an enhanced understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration, enabling the analysis of large bulk RNA-sequencing studies for cell composition and suggests that correcting for the cellular structure when performing transcriptomic analysis will lead to novel insights of AD.	4
Chronic sun exposure-related fusion oncogenes EGFR-PPARGC1A in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. ||  || Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) differs from SCC of other organs in its strong association with chronic sun exposure. However, the specific driver mutations in cSCC remain unknown. Fusion genes in established cSCC cell lines (A431 and DJM-1) were predicted by transcriptome sequence, and validated by Sanger sequence, fluorescence in situ hybridization and G-banding. By transcriptome sequencing, we identified fusion gene EGFR-PPARGC1A in A431, which were expressed in 31 of 102 cSCCs. The lesions harboring the fusion gene tended to be located in sun-exposed areas. In vivo cutaneous implantation of EGFR-PPARGC1A-expressing NIH3T3 induced tumors resembling human cSCC, indicating its potent tumorigenicity. NIH3T3 transfected with EGFR-PPARGC1A as well as A431 showed increased cell proliferation activity. With regard to underlying mechanism, EGFR-PPARGC1A protein causes constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation, and induces the phosphorylation of wild-type full-length epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by dimerization. Conversely, the RNAi-mediated attenuation of EGFR or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of the fusion gene in A431 led to a decrease in the cell number, and may have therapeutic value. Our findings advance the knowledge concerning genetic causes of cSCC and the function of EGFR, with potential implications for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.	0
Degradation of mutant p53H175 protein by Zn(II) through autophagy. || Autophagy Cell Line, Tumor Curcumin Down-Regulation HCT116 Cells Humans Microtubule-Associated Proteins Mutation RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc Compounds || TP53, one of the most important oncosuppressors, is frequently mutated in cancer. Several p53 mutant proteins escape proteolytic degradation and are highly expressed in an aberrant conformation often acquiring pro-oncogenic activities that promote tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Therefore, it has been vastly proposed that reactivation of wild-type (wt) function(s) from mutant p53 (mutp53) may have therapeutic significance. We have previously reported that Zn(II) restores a folded conformation from mutp53 misfolding, rescuing wild-type (wt) p53/DNA-binding and transcription activities. However, whether Zn(II) affects mutp53 stability has never been investigated. Here we show that a novel Zn(II) compound induced mutp53 (R175H) protein degradation through autophagy, the proteolytic machinery specifically devoted to clearing misfolded proteins. Accordingly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy prevented Zn(II)-mediated mutp53H175 degradation as well as the ability of the Zn(II) compound to restore wtp53 DNA-binding and transcription activity from this mutant. By contrast, inhibition of the proteasome failed to do so, suggesting that autophagy is the main route for p53H175 degradation. Mechanistically, Zn(II) restored the wtp53 ability to induce the expression of the p53 target gene DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator), a key regulator of autophagy, leading to autophagic induction. Accordingly, inhibition of wtp53 transactivation by pifithrin-α (PFT-α) impaired both autophagy and mutp53H175 degradation induced by curcumin-based zinc compound (Zn(II)-curc). Viewed together, our results uncover a novel mechanism employed by Zn(II)-curc to reactivate mutp53H175, which involves, at least in part, induction of mutp53 degradation via wtp53-mediated autophagy.	0
A novel mutant p53 binding partner BAG5 stabilizes mutant p53 and promotes mutant p53 GOFs in tumorigenesis. ||  || Tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors. Many tumor-associated mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins gain new tumor-promoting activities, including increased proliferation, metastasis and chemoresistance of tumor cells, which are defined as gain-of-functions (GOFs). Mutp53 proteins often accumulate at high levels in human tumors, which is important for mutp53 to exert their GOFs. The mechanism underlying mutp53 proteins accumulation in tumors is not fully understood. Here, we report that BAG5, a member of Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family proteins, promotes mutp53 accumulation in tumors, which in turn enhances mutp53 GOFs. Mechanistically, BAG5 interacts with mutp53 proteins to protect mutp53 from ubiquitination and degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and CHIP, which in turn promotes mutp53 protein accumulation and therefore GOFs in promoting cell proliferation, tumor growth, cell migration and chemoresistance. BAG5 is frequently overexpressed in many human tumors and the overexpression of BAG5 is associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. Altogether, this study revealed that inhibition of mutp53 degradation by BAG5 is a novel and critical mechanism underlying mutp53 protein accumulation and GOFs in cancer. Furthermore, our results also uncovered that promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOFs is a novel mechanism of BAG5 in tumorigenesis.	0
Involvement of p38 in signal switching from autophagy to apoptosis via the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 axis in selenite-treated NB4 cells. || Activating Transcription Factor 4 Animals Apoptosis Autophagy Cell Line, Tumor Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2 Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic Heterografts Humans Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute Mice Mice, Nude Microtubule-Associated Proteins Neoplasm Transplantation Phosphorylation Response Elements Selenious Acid Signal Transduction Trace Elements Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays eIF-2 Kinase p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases || Selenite has emerged as an optional chemotherapeutic agent for hematological malignancies. Autophagy and apoptosis are both engaged in selenite-induced cell death. In a previous report, we have identified heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a critical modulator of the balance between autophagy and apoptosis in selenite-treated leukemia cells. However, the mechanisms by which selenite mediates the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway and p38 are core modules for the selenite-induced switch to apoptosis from autophagy. We found that selenite activated PERK and eIF2α/ATF4 downstream to promote apoptosis. During this progression, p38 was dissociated from PERK-inhibiting Hsp90 and became autophosphorylated. Then, activated p38 further enhanced the docking of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) onto the CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) promoter via eIF2α to enhance apoptosis. We also found that activated p38 suppressed the phosphorylation of eIF4E that directed ATF4 to bind to the MAP1LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B) promoter. Because of the deactivation of eIF4E, the association of ATF4 with the MAP1LC3B promoter was inhibited, and autophagy was compromised. Intriguingly, p53 played important roles in mediating the p38-mediated regulation of eIF2α and eIF4E. When activated by p38, p53 induced the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the dephosphorylation of eIF4E, particularly in the nucleus where the ATF4 transcription factor was modulated, ultimately resulting in differential expression of CHOP and LC3. Moreover, selenite exhibited potent antitumor effects in vivo. In an NB4 cell xenograft model, selenite induced apoptosis and hampered autophagy. In addition, related signaling proteins demonstrated similar changes to those observed in vitro. These data suggest that selenite may be a candidate drug for leukemia therapy.	0
Mutation detection in GJB2 gene among Malays with non-syndromic hearing loss. || Connexin 26 Connexins Cross-Sectional Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Malaysia Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Genetic Prevalence || To identify the mutations in the GJB2 gene and to determine its association with non-syndromic hearing loss in Malays. A comparative cross sectional study was conducted on a group of children from the deaf schools and the normal schools. A total of 91 buccal cell samples of non-syndromic hearing loss and 91 normal hearing children were taken. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the coding region of GJB2 gene. The PCR product of GJB2 coding region was preceded with screening for mutations using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and mutations detected were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Twelve sequence variations including mutations and polymorphisms were found in 32 patients and 37 control subjects. The variations were G4D, V27I, E114G, T123N, V37I and R127H in both groups, W24X, R32H, 257_259 del CGC and M34L in patients only and I203T and V153I in control subjects only. There were no association between homozygous (P=0.368) or heterozygous (P=0.164) GJB2 gene and non-syndromic hearing loss. The types of GJB2 gene mutation were different and vary in Malay non-syndromic hearing loss as compared to the other races. Furthermore, the mutation did not associate with hearing loss in the population. Other related genes are believed to be involved and need to be sought in this group of patients.	4
Telomere shortening is a hallmark of genetic cardiomyopathies. || Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Cell Division Female Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Male Muscle Proteins Mutation Telomere Shortening || This study demonstrates that significantly shortened telomeres are a hallmark of cardiomyocytes (CMs) from individuals with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as a result of heritable defects in cardiac proteins critical to contractile function. Positioned at the ends of chromosomes, telomeres are DNA repeats that serve as protective caps that shorten with each cell division, a marker of aging. CMs are a known exception in which telomeres remain relatively stable throughout life in healthy individuals. We found that, relative to healthy controls, telomeres are significantly shorter in CMs of genetic HCM and DCM patient tissues harboring pathogenic mutations: TNNI3,MYBPC3,MYH7,DMD,TNNT2, andTTN Quantitative FISH (Q-FISH) of single cells revealed that telomeres were significantly reduced by 26% in HCM and 40% in DCM patient CMs in fixed tissue sections compared with CMs from age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In the cardiac tissues of the same patients, telomere shortening was not evident in vascular smooth muscle cells that do not express or require the contractile proteins, an important control. Telomere shortening was recapitulated in DCM and HCM CMs differentiated from patient-derived human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) measured by two independent assays. This study reveals telomere shortening as a hallmark of genetic HCM and DCM and demonstrates that this shortening can be modeled in vitro by using the hiPSC platform, enabling drug discovery.	4
Familial hypercholesterolemia: potential diagnostic value of mutation screening in a pediatric population of South Africa. ||  || Three founder-related low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene mutations, D154N, D206E and V408M, cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in approximately 90% of South African Afrikaners. Two hundred and twenty-one South African children, from 85 affected families, were screened for the specific mutation identified previously in the index case. Sixty boys and 56 girls were heterozygous for mutation D154N (FH3), D206E (FH1) or V408M (FH2). Total and LDL cholesterol (LDLC) levels were similar among the children heterozygous for the three founder mutations, and mean values were significantly higher compared to those without a known mutation (p < 0.0001). Plasma cholesterol levels overlapped considerably between the different groups, suggesting that modifiable lifestyle factors remain important in children with FH. This study demonstrates the potential diagnostic value of mutation screening in a pediatric population with an enrichment of particular gene mutations.	4
DDX3X promotes the biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs and the potential roles they played in cancer development. || Carcinogenesis Cell Line DEAD-box RNA Helicases Gene Expression Profiling Gene Knockdown Techniques Genes, Reporter Humans Immunoprecipitation Luciferases MicroRNAs Neoplasms || DDX3X, located on the X-chromosome, belongs to the DEAD-box RNA helicase family and acts as a key RNA-binding protein to exert its regulatory functions in various biological processes. In this paper, knock-down the expression of DDX3X can affect a subset of miRNA expression levels, especially for miR-1, miR-141, miR-145, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-34a. Through adopting the immunoprecipitation (IP), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), dual luciferase reporter assays, we illustrate that DDX3X could interact with Drosha/DGCR8 complex, elevate the processing activity of Drosha/DGCR8 complex on pri-miRNAs, and increase mature miRNA expression levels. For the studies of potential roles and biological functions of DDX3X-dependent miRNAs and their downstream target genes in multiple cancers, we use the primary data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and several miRNA target prediction databases, to systematically analyze the expression levels of DDX3X-dependent miRNAs in almost 14 kinds of cancers versus normal tissues, and the essential biological functions for their putative downstream target genes. All these findings will provide us novel insights and directions for thoroughly exploring the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA biogenesis, and shed light on effectively searching the clinical significances and biological roles of DDX3X-dependent miRNAs and their target genes in cancer development.	0

Evaluation of the gene-age interactions in HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels: the impact of the SORT1 polymorphism on LDL cholesterol levels is age dependent. || Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport Adult Age Factors Cardiovascular Diseases Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Cohort Studies Cross-Sectional Studies Female Genotype Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Genetic Triglycerides Utah || Several genes that influence HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels have been identified. The effects of genetic polymorphisms on lipid levels may be age dependent. We replicated 17 of these previously identified associations and then used cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis to investigate age-SNP interaction effects. The rs646776 SNP at the SORT1 locus showed an age interaction that was significant in cross-sectional analyses of 1350 individuals from Utah (p = 0.0003) and in 2977 individuals from the NHLBI Family Heart Study (p = 0.007) as well as in longitudinal analysis of a subsample of 1099 individuals from the Utah cohort that had been followed for over 20 years (p = 0.0001). The rs646776 genotype-specific difference in LDL-C levels was significantly greater for younger individuals than for older individuals. These findings may help elucidate the mode of action of the SORT1 gene and impact potential therapeutic interventions targeting this pathway.	4
Lifelong reduction of LDL-cholesterol related to a common variant in the LDL-receptor gene decreases the risk of coronary artery disease--a Mendelian Randomisation study. || Anticholesteremic Agents Case-Control Studies Cholesterol, LDL Chromosome Mapping Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10 Coronary Disease Genetic Variation Humans Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Random Allocation Receptors, LDL Risk Assessment Risk Factors || Rare mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR) cause familial hypercholesterolemia, which increases the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Less is known about the implications of common genetic variation in the LDLR gene regarding the variability of cholesterol levels and risk of CAD. Imputed genotype data at the LDLR locus on 1 644 individuals of a population-based sample were explored for association with LDL-C level. Replication of association with LDL-C level was sought for the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the LDLR gene in three European samples comprising 6 642 adults and 533 children. Association of this SNP with CAD was examined in six case-control studies involving more than 15 000 individuals. Each copy of the minor T allele of SNP rs2228671 within LDLR (frequency 11%) was related to a decrease of LDL-C levels by 0.19 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.13-0.24] mmol/L, p = 1.5x10(-10)). This association with LDL-C was uniformly found in children, men, and women of all samples studied. In parallel, the T allele of rs2228671 was associated with a significantly lower risk of CAD (Odds Ratio per copy of the T allele: 0.82, 95% CI [0.76-0.89], p = 2.1x10(-7)). Adjustment for LDL-C levels by logistic regression or Mendelian Randomisation models abolished the significant association between rs2228671 with CAD completely, indicating a functional link between the genetic variant at the LDLR gene locus, change in LDL-C and risk of CAD. A common variant at the LDLR gene locus affects LDL-C levels and, thereby, the risk for CAD.	4

Mendelian-inherited heart disease: a gateway to understanding mechanisms in heart disease Update on work done at the University of Stellenbosch. || Biomedical Research Death, Sudden, Cardiac Founder Effect Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heart Diseases Humans Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular Inheritance Patterns Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Risk Factors Romano-Ward Syndrome Severity of Illness Index South Africa Universities || The presence of founder effects in South Africa for many single-gene diseases, which include heart diseases such as progressive familial heart block types I and II, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the long QT syndromes, afforded us the opportunity to identify causal genes and associated mutations through genetic mapping and positional cloning. From finding the genes, the emphasis has shifted to elucidating how primary defects cause disease and recognising factors that could explain the often pronounced phenotypic variability seen in persons carrying the same inherited defect. In some of these diseases, sudden unexpected death has been a frequent occurrence in young, apparently healthy individuals who had not been aware that they had inherited an underlying risk. Herein, we review progress in identifying genes, mutations and risk factors associated with the diseases mentioned.	4
The genomic landscape of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia. || Aneuploidy Animals Base Sequence Cell Line, Tumor Chromosome Aberrations Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Haploidy Humans Ikaros Transcription Factor Mice Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Retinoblastoma Protein Signal Transduction Transplantation, Heterologous Treatment Outcome Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The genetic basis of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a subtype of ALL characterized by aneuploidy and poor outcome, is unknown. Genomic profiling of 124 hypodiploid ALL cases, including whole-genome and exome sequencing of 40 cases, identified two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy, transcriptional profiles and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near-haploid ALL with 24-31 chromosomes harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and Ras signaling (71%) and the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF3 (encoding AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low-hypodiploid ALL with 32-39 chromosomes are characterized by alterations in TP53 (91.2%) that are commonly present in nontumor cells, IKZF2 (encoding HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both near-haploid and low-hypodiploid leukemic cells show activation of Ras-signaling and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathways and are sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for this aggressive form of leukemia.	0
Characterization of phenylketonuria alleles in the Italian population. ||  || In order to identify the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in Italy, we screened the entire coding sequence of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in 20 Italian PKU patients, whose origins are scattered throughout Italy. The frequency of each identified mutation and of 5 other European mutations was determined within a panel of 92 Italian PKU patients. This approach allowed us to identify 20 different PKU mutations and characterize 64% of the Italian PKU chromosomes. Eleven mutations (IVS10nt546, L48S, R158Q, R261Q, P281L, R261X, R252W, delta T55, IVS7nt1, IVS12nt1, Y414C) represent 55.4% of the Italian PKU alleles, the most common mutations being IVS10nt546 (12.4%) and L48S (9%). All the other mutations are very rare. These data confirm the great heterogeneity expected from previous RFLP haplotype studies. Genotype/phenotype correlation allowed for assessment of the clinical impact of the 20 identified mutations.	1 3
Radiosensitization and downregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) upon inhibition of mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) in malignant melanoma cells. || Blotting, Western DNA Repair Down-Regulation Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Flow Cytometry GTP Phosphohydrolases Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K Humans Melanoma Membrane Proteins Microscopy, Fluorescence Middle Aged Mutation RNA, Small Interfering Radiation Tolerance Tissue Array Analysis Transfection || Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is an important cofactor in the p53-mediated DNA damage response pathway upon ionizing radiation (IR) and exerts anti-apoptotic effects also independent of p53 pathway activation. Furthermore, hnRNP K is overexpressed in various neoplasms including malignant melanoma (MM). Here, we investigate the role of hnRNP K in the radioresistance of MM cells. Our results show cytoplasmic expression of hnRNP K in human MM surgical specimens, but not in benign nevi, and a quick dose- and time-dependent upregulation in response to IR accompanied by cytoplasmic redistribution of the protein in the IPC-298 cellular tumor model carrying an activating NRAS mutation (p.Q61L). SiRNA-based knockdown of hnRNP K induced a delayed decline in γH2AX/53BP1-positive DNA repair foci upon IR. Pharmacological interference with MAPK signaling abrogated ERK phosphorylation, diminished cellular hnRNP K levels, impaired γH2AX/53BP1-foci repair and proliferative capability and increased apoptosis comparable to the observed hnRNP K knockdown phenotype in IPC-298 cells. Our results indicate that pharmacological interference with MAPK signaling increases vulnerability of NRAS-mutant malignant melanoma cells to ionizing radiation along with downregulation of endogenous hnRNP K and point towards a possible use for combined MEK inhibition and localized radiation therapy of MM in the NRAS-mutant setting where BRAF inhibitors offer no clinical benefit.	0
Particular gene upregulation and p53 heterogeneous expression in TP53-mutated maxillary carcinoma. ||  || It has been demonstrated that tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutation in maxillary squamous cell carcinoma, is more treatment-resistant compared with the carcinoma withoutTP53 mutation. However, the association betweenTP53 mutation and treatment resistance remains unclear. As a first step in understanding the biological differences between tumors with and withoutTP53 mutation, a comprehensive gene expression analysis of maxillary squamous cell carcinoma with or withoutTP53 mutation was performed. A total of 42 genes were identified to be differentially expressed by >4-fold. Quantification of their mRNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated 18 genes with high expression and three genes with low expression inTP53 mutated tumors vs.TP53 wild-type tumors. The 18 genes included eight cell adhesion (DSC3, GRHL1, EPPK1, PROM2,ANXA8, DSP, JUP, andKRT6B) and four cell growth inhibition (SFN,CLCA2,SAMD9 andTP63) genes. Among these genes,DSC3,SFN, andCSTA, whose expression was markedly increased, also demonstrated high protein expression in immunohistochemical staining ofTP53 mutated tumors. TheTP53 mutated tumors demonstrated high nuclear staining of the TP53 protein only in tumor cells at the tumor margins adjacent to the stroma, whereas the tumor interior was negative for TP53. However, all tumor cells ofTP53 wild-type tumors exhibited positive nuclear staining for the TP53 protein. The combined findings suggest thatTP53 mutated tumors possess a phenotype opposite to that associated with cancer progression and malignant transformation, and exhibit tumor cell heterogeneity between the tumor interior and margins.	0
Gain-of-function mutant p53 upregulates CXC chemokines and enhances cell migration. || Acetylation Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Chemokines, CXC Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Down-Regulation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockdown Techniques Histones Humans Lung Neoplasms Melanoma Mutation NF-kappa B p52 Subunit Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || The role of dominant transforming p53 in carcinogenesis is poorly understood. Our previous data suggested that aberrant p53 proteins can enhance tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we examined potential mechanisms through which gain-of-function (GOF) p53 proteins can induce motility. Cells expressing GOF p53 -R175H, -R273H and -D281G showed enhanced migration, which was reversed by RNA interference (RNAi) or transactivation-deficient mutants. In cells with engineered or endogenous p53 mutants, enhanced migration was reduced by downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB2, a GOF p53 target. We found that GOF p53 proteins upregulate CXC-chemokine expression, the inflammatory mediators that contribute to multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. Elevated expression of CXCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL12 was found in cells expressing oncogenic p53. Transcription was elevated as CXCL5 and CXCL8 promoter activity was higher in cells expressing GOF p53, whereas wild-type p53 repressed promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed enhanced presence of acetylated histone H3 on the CXCL5 promoter in H1299/R273H cells, in agreement with increased transcriptional activity of the promoter, whereas RNAi-mediated repression of CXCL5 inhibited cell migration. Consistent with this, knockdown of the endogenous mutant p53 in lung cancer or melanoma cells reduced CXCL5 expression and cell migration. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA knockdown of mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced expression of a number of key targets, including several chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. Finally, CXCL5 expression was also elevated in lung tumor samples containing GOF p53, indicating relevance to human cancer. The data suggest a mechanistic link between GOF p53 proteins and chemokines in enhanced cell motility.	0
[Familial hypercholesterolemia due to a new mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene]. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC) is a genetic disorder manifest as a rise in serum cholesterol level responsible for the development ofcardiovascular diseases. To study genetic peculiarities of FHC in Kareliya. 109 patients of the 196 ones with FHC (124 families) were subjected to genetic examination. Other parameters studied included the lipid spectrum, blood glucose level, ECG, 24 hr ECG monitoring, echocardiography, triplex scanning of brachiocephalic arteries and lower limb vessels, functional tests. Simon Broom criteria were used to diagnose FHC. "Definitive" FHC was diagnosed in 136 (69.4%) patients, (probable) FHC in 30.6%. The total encoding region of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene was sequenced in 109 (55.6%) patients in parallel with the search for major mutations in the APOB and PCSK9 genes. A total of 13 mutations (p.G20R, c. 192del110/ins8, c.195-196insT, p.S206R, c925- 931del17, p.S447C, p.13981, p.L426P, L511S, c.1686del18/insT, p.L646I, p.N640N, c.2191delG) were identified in low density lipoprotein receptor gene; seven of them are reported for the first time in the world. No major mutations in the APOB and PCSK9 genes were found. The new c.2191delG (p.(Val73 1Serfs*6)) mutation is characterized and its segregation with familial dyslipidemia is shown. The present case is characterized by the absence of clinical picture of coronary heart disease and the family history complicated by cerebral basin lesion. Phenotypic manifestations of atherosclerosis in FHC with gene mutations need further studies.	4
The impact of arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid on p53 R273H-codon mutant glioblastoma. || Amino Acid Sequence Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Arsenic Trioxide Arsenicals Brain Neoplasms Cell Differentiation Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Codon Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Genes, p53 Glioblastoma Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Neoplastic Stem Cells Oxides Tretinoin || Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and demonstrates a 1-year median survival time. Codon-specific hotspot mutations of p53 result in constitutively active mutant p53, which promotes aberrant proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and cell cycle checkpoint failure in GBM. Recently identified CD133(+) cancer stem cell populations (CSC) within GBM also confer therapeutic resistance. We studied targeted therapy in a codon-specific p53 mutant (R273H) created by site-directed mutagenesis in U87MG. The effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO, 1 μM) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 10 μM), possible targeted treatments of CSCs, were investigated in U87MG neurospheres. The results showed that U87-p53(R273H) cells generated more rapid neurosphere growth than U87-p53(wt) but inhibition of neurosphere proliferation was seen with both ATO and ATRA. U87-p53(R273H) neurospheres showed resistance to differentiation into glial cells and neuronal cells with ATO and ATRA exposure. ATO was able to generate apoptosis at high doses and proliferation of U87-p53(wt) and U87-p53(R273H) cells was reduced with ATO and ATRA in a dose-dependent manner. Elevated pERK1/2 and p53 expression was seen in U87-p53(R273H) neurospheres, which could be reduced with ATO and ATRA treatment. Additionally, differential responses in pERK1/2 were seen with ATO treatment in neurospheres and non-neurosphere cells. In conclusion, codon-specific mutant p53 conferred a more aggressive phenotype to our CSC model. However, ATO and ATRA could potently suppress CSC properties in vitro and may support further clinical investigation of these agents.	0
Genetic determinants of inherited susceptibility to hypercholesterolemia - a comprehensive literature review. || Cholesterol Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Hypercholesterolemia Lipid Metabolism Metabolic Networks and Pathways Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || Hypercholesterolemia is a strong determinant of mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular diseases and a major contributor to the global disease burden. Mutations in four genes (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1) account for the majority of cases with familial hypercholesterolemia. However, a substantial proportion of adults with hypercholesterolemia do not have a mutation in any of these four genes. This indicates the probability of having other genes with a causative or contributory role in the pathogenesis of hypercholesterolemia and suggests a polygenic inheritance of this condition. Here in, we review the recent evidence of association of the genetic variants with hypercholesterolemia and the three lipid traits; total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), their biological pathways and the associated pathogenetic mechanisms. Nearly 80 genes involved in lipid metabolism (encoding structural components of lipoproteins, lipoprotein receptors and related proteins, enzymes, lipid transporters, lipid transfer proteins, and activators or inhibitors of protein function and gene transcription) with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are recognized to be associated with hypercholesterolemia and serum lipid traits in genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies were identified. In addition, genome-wide association studies in different populations have identified SNVs associated with TC, HDL-C and LDL-C in nearly 120 genes within or in the vicinity of the genes that are not known to be involved in lipid metabolism. Over 90% of the SNVs in both these groups are located outside the coding regions of the genes. These findings indicates that there might be a considerable number of unrecognized processes and mechanisms of lipid homeostasis, which when disrupted, would lead to hypercholesterolemia. Knowledge of these molecular pathways will enable the discovery of novel treatment and preventive methods as well as identify the biochemical and molecular markers for the risk prediction and early detection of this common, yet potentially debilitating condition.	4
Role of base excision repair in maintaining the genetic and epigenetic integrity of CpG sites. || 5-Methylcytosine CpG Islands DNA DNA Methylation DNA Repair Deamination Endodeoxyribonucleases Epigenesis, Genetic Humans Models, Molecular Oxidation-Reduction Protein Structure, Secondary Protein Structure, Tertiary Thymine DNA Glycosylase || Cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides is a central component of epigenetic regulation in vertebrates, and the base excision repair (BER) pathway is important for maintaining both the genetic stability and the methylation status of CpG sites. This perspective focuses on two enzymes that are of particular importance for the genetic and epigenetic integrity of CpG sites, methyl binding domain 4 (MBD4) and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). We discuss their capacity for countering C to T mutations at CpG sites, by initiating base excision repair of G · T mismatches generated by deamination of 5-methylcytosine (5mC). We also consider their role in active DNA demethylation, including pathways that are initiated by oxidation and/or deamination of 5mC.	0
GJB2 gene mutations in childhood deafness. || Child Chromosome Aberrations Cochlear Implants Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Frameshift Mutation Genes, Dominant Genes, Recessive Genetic Testing Humans Male Myosins || The frequency of childhood deafness is estimated at 1:1,000 and at least half of these cases are genetic. Recently, mutations in the GJB2 gene have been found in a great number of familial and sporadic cases of congenital deafness in Caucasians. The most common mutation (70%) is the frameshift mutation of a single guanine in position 35 (35delG). More than 20 mutations in the GJB2 gene are associated with DFNB1, a prevalent type of autosomal recessive non-syndromic neurosensory deafness. Last year we initiated a systematic screening programme to evaluate the causes of deafness in the population of prelingually deaf children who are referred to our cochlear implant programme. All of the deaf children and their parents undergo a comprehensive medical review, directed to identify causes of acquired deafness and manifestations of syndromic hearing impairment. DNA is extracted from the blood of all of the children. The technique AS-PCR (allele-specific polymerase chain reaction) is used for the identification of the mutation 35delG. Screening for other GJB2 gene mutations is carried out by single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP). Our results on the identification of DFNB1 will be presented, as well as a discussion on the implications of an aetiological diagnosis in cochlear implantation.	4

Structural insights into substrate and inhibitor binding sites in human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1. || Allosteric Regulation Allosteric Site Amino Acid Substitution Catalytic Domain Crystallography, X-Ray Drug Design Enzyme Inhibitors Humans Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase Models, Molecular Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Oximes Recombinant Proteins Substrate Specificity Sulfonamides Tryptophan || Human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (hIDO1) is an attractive cancer immunotherapeutic target owing to its role in promoting tumoral immune escape. However, drug development has been hindered by limited structural information. Here, we report the crystal structures of hIDO1 in complex with its substrate, Trp, an inhibitor, epacadostat, and/or an effector, indole ethanol (IDE). The data reveal structural features of the active site (Sa) critical for substrate activation; in addition, they disclose a new inhibitor-binding mode and a distinct small molecule binding site (Si). Structure-guided mutation of a critical residue, F270, to glycine perturbs the Si site, allowing structural determination of an inhibitory complex, where both the Sa and Si sites are occupied by Trp. The Si site offers a novel target site for allosteric inhibitors and a molecular explanation for the previously baffling substrate-inhibition behavior of the enzyme. Taken together, the data open exciting new avenues for structure-based drug design.	0
Bone resorption in syndromes of the Ras/MAPK pathway. || Absorptiometry, Photon Adolescent Adult Amino Acids Biomarkers Bone Density Bone Resorption Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Cohort Studies Collagen Costello Syndrome DNA Mutational Analysis Ectodermal Dysplasia Facies Failure to Thrive Female Genetic Testing Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Hydrolysis MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction Young Adult || Disorders of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have an overlapping skeletal phenotype (e.g. scoliosis, osteopenia). The Ras proteins regulate cell proliferation and differentiation and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) individuals have osteoclast hyperactivity and increased bone resorption as measured by urine pyridinium crosslinks [pyridinoline (Pyd) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpd)]. Pyd and Dpd are hydroxylysine-derived crosslinks of collagen found in bone and cartilage and excreted in the urine. Dpd is most abundant in bone. The aim of this study was to evaluate if other syndromes of the Ras/MAPK pathway have increased bone resorption, which may impact the skeletal phenotype. Participants were individuals with Noonan syndrome (n = 14), Costello syndrome (n = 21), and cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome (n = 14). Pyridinium crosslinks from two consecutive first morning urines were extracted after acid hydrolysis and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Three separate analyses of covariance were performed to compare Pyd, Dpd, and Dpd/Pyd ratio of each group to controls after controlling for age. Data were compared to 99 healthy controls. The Dpd and the Dpd/Pyd ratio were elevated (p < 0.0001) in all three conditions compared to controls suggesting that collagen degradation was predominantly from bone. The data suggest that the Ras/MAPK signal transduction pathway is important in bone homeostasis.	4
EGFR regulates RhoA-GTP dependent cell motility in E-cadherin mutant cells. || Animals CHO Cells Cadherins Cell Movement Cricetinae Cricetulus ErbB Receptors Germ-Line Mutation Models, Biological Mutation Mutation, Missense beta Catenin rhoA GTP-Binding Protein || Gastric cancer associated E-cadherin germline missense mutations lead to significant functional consequences, in both the structural and signalling properties of the protein. In this study, we have characterized the effect of four E-cadherin germline missense mutations (T340A, A634V, P799R and V832M) in the interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We challenged the hypothesis that E-cadherin mutations perturb its ability to bind to EGFR, leading to constitutional activation of the EGFR, triggering activation of downstream effectors. We verified that missense mutations localized in the extracellular domain of the protein (T340A and A634V) exhibited reduced stability of the EGFR/E-cadherin heterodimers in contrast to germline mutations localized at the cytoplasmatic domain of the protein (P799R and V832M). We observed that cells expressing E-cadherin extracellular mutants displayed increased levels of phosphorylated EGFR upon ligand stimulation, when compared with cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin or intracellular mutants. We showed that upon treatment of E-cadherin extracellular mutant cells with the EGFR inhibitor, the increase of RhoA activation is abrogated and accompanied by decreased migratory behaviour, supporting the idea that Rho-like proteins are EGFR downstream effectors. Our results bring new insights into the understanding of the distinct in vitro behaviours observed for E-cadherin missense mutations localized in different domains of the protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E-cadherin-dependent EGFR activation contributes to enhanced cell motility, in a mechanism involving RhoA activation.	0
Radiogenomic evaluation of lung cancer - Are there imaging characteristics associated with lung adenocarcinomas harboring BRAF mutations? || Adenocarcinoma Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Tomography, X-Ray Computed || We studied computed tomography (CT) features associated with BRAF mutated lung cancer. CT features of BRAF mutated lung cancers were compared to stage matched lesions without BRAF mutation. 47 (25%) patients with BRAF mutation and 141 (75%) without BRAF mutation were included. BRAF lesions were most frequently solid 37 (84%), spiculated 22 (50%), and peripheral 37 (84%). No feature of the primary tumor was significantly different between BRAF and non-BRAF groups. BRAF patients were more likely than KRAS patients to have pleural metastases [5 (11%) vs 0 (0%), p=0.045]. No feature of the primary tumor differentiates BRAF lesions from non-BRAF lesions.	4
Analysis of recently identified dyslipidemia alleles reveals two loci that contribute to risk for carotid artery disease. || Aged Alleles Carotid Artery Diseases Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1 Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19 Dyslipidemias Genetic Loci Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Linkage Disequilibrium Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Risk Factors || Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting high density lipoprotein (HDL) or low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels; these SNPs may contribute to the genetic basis of vascular diseases. We assessed the impact of 34 SNPs at 23 loci on dyslipidemia, key lipid sub-phenotypes, and severe carotid artery disease (CAAD) in a case-control cohort. The effects of these SNPs on HDL and LDL were consistent with those previously reported, and we provide unbiased estimates of the percent variance in HDL (3.9%) and LDL (3.3%) explained by genetic risk scores. We assessed the effects of these SNPs on HDL subfractions, apolipoprotein A-1, LDL buoyancy, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein (a) and found that rs646776 predicts apolipoprotein B level while rs2075650 predicts LDL buoyancy. Finally, we tested the role of these SNPs in conferring risk for ultrasonographically documented CAAD stenosis status. We found that two loci, chromosome 1p13.3 near CELSR2 and PSRC1 which contains rs646776, and 19q13.2 near TOMM40 and APOE which contains rs2075650, harbor risk alleles for CAAD. Our analysis of 34 SNPs contributing to dyslipidemia at 23 loci suggests that genetic variation in the 1p13.3 region may increase risk of CAAD by increasing LDL particle number, whereas variation in the 19q13.2 region may increase CAAD risk by promoting formation of smaller, denser LDL particles.	4
ctDNA dynamics: a novel indicator to track resistance in metastatic breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 therapy. || anti-HER2 therapy circulating tumor DNA dynamics metastatic breast cancer progression || Most studies utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor disease interrogated only one or a few genes and failed to develop workable criteria to inform clinical practice. We evaluated the feasibility of detecting resistance to anti-HER2 therapy by serial gene-panel ctDNA sequencing. Primary therapeutic resistance was identified in 6 out of 14 patients with events of progressive disease. For this subset comparison of pre- and post-treatment ctDNA assay results revealed that HER2 amplification concurred with disease progression (4/6, 66.7%). Mutations in TP53 (3/6, 50.0%) and genes implicated in the PI3K/mTOR pathway (3/6, 50.0%) were also dominant markers of resistance. Together, resistance to HER2 blockade should be indicated during treatment if any of the following situations applies: 1) recurrence or persistence of HER2 amplification in the blood; 2) emergence or ≥20% increase in the fraction of mutations in any of these resistance-related genes including TP53/PIK3CA/MTOR/PTEN. Compared with CT scans, dynamic ctDNA profiling utilizing pre-defined criteria was sensitive in identifying drug resistance (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 55.0%), with a concordance rate up to 82.1%. Besides, the ctDNA criteria had a discriminating role in the prognosis of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. 52 plasma samples were prospectively collected from 18 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who were treated with an oral anti-HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01937689). ctDNA was assayed by gene-panel target-capture next-generation sequencing. Longitudinal gene-panel ctDNA sequencing could be exploited to determine resistance and guide the precise administration of anti-HER2 targeted therapy in the metastatic setting.	4
Sequencing of exons 4, 5, 12 of COCH gene in patients with postlingual sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by vestibular lesion. ||  || Mutations at the DFNA9 locus on chromosome 14q12 are the third most common form of DFNA hearing loss, which is clinically characterized by late onset (in adulthood) progressive sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by vestibular dysfunction. The aim of the study was to search for COCH gene mutations (P51S, V66G, G87W, G88E, V104del, I109N, W117R, A119T, M512T, C542Y) in patients with severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by a vestibular lesion. The study was based on a group of 30 patients. Qualification criteria comprised the presence of progressive postlingual, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss with tinnitus, early age of sensorineural hearing loss onset, before the 40th year of life, and a positive family history of early onset hearing loss. All patients were diagnosed with peripheral vestibular lesions. The authors did not find P51S, V66G, G87W, G88E, V104del, I109N, W117R, A119T, M512T, or C542Y mutations in the COCH gene in the tested group (no differences were found in the nucleotide sequences of exomes 4, 5 and 12 when compared to the published cDNA sequence of the COCH gene). No cochlin mutations were found in the group of patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing impairment accompanied by a vestibular lesion. The COCH gene needs further exploration and analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations.	4

While all mutants were defective for binding to DNA at 37 ;C, each bound specifically to several cognate p53 binding sites at sub-physiological temperatures (25-33 ;C), and several mutants activated transcription from a p53-responsive promoter at 26 degrees C in transfected H1299 cells. Heating mutant p53 proteins at 37 degrees C irreversibly destroyed their ability to subsequently bind at 25 degrees C. However, several different monoclonal antibodies that each share the ability to recognize an epitope encompassing amino acids 46-55 markedly stabilized binding by mutant p53 proteins at 37 degrees C. Both intact antibody and FAb fragments allowed mutant p53 to bind to DNA. By contrast, antibodies that recognize epitopes located elsewhere within p53 stabilized mutant p53 binding significantly less effectively. Our data show that the major hot-spot p53 mutants have the intrinsic ability to bind to DNA and that a unique region within the N terminus of p53 may be critical for rescuing them from loss of binding at physiological temperatures. This suggests the possibility of developing small molecules that can stabilize mutant p53 proteins under physiological conditions.	0
A comprehensive survey of Ras mutations in cancer. || Catalytic Domain Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Codon Databases, Genetic Epigenesis, Genetic Genes, ras Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Conformation Neoplasms Point Mutation Protein Isoforms Signal Transduction ras Proteins || All mammalian cells express 3 closely related Ras proteins, termed H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras, that promote oncogenesis when they are mutationally activated at codon 12, 13, or 61. Although there is a high degree of similarity among the isoforms, K-Ras mutations are far more frequently observed in cancer, and each isoform displays preferential coupling to particular cancer types. We examined the mutational spectra of Ras isoforms curated from large-scale tumor profiling and found that each isoform exhibits surprisingly distinctive codon mutation and amino-acid substitution biases. These findings were unexpected given that these mutations occur in regions that share 100% amino-acid sequence identity among the 3 isoforms. Of importance, many of these mutational biases were not due to differences in exposure to mutagens, because the patterns were still evident when compared within specific cancer types. We discuss potential genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, as well as isoform-specific differences in protein structure and signaling, that may promote these distinct mutation patterns and differential coupling to specific cancers.	0
Clinical characteristics of a Dutch DFNA9 family with a novel COCH mutation, G87W. ||  || The present study aims to report audiological and vestibular characteristics of a Dutch DFNA9 family with a novel mutation, G87W, in the LCCL domain of COCH. From the family with the novel G87W COCH mutation audiometric data were collected and analyzed longitudinally. Results were compared with those obtained in previously identified P51S COCH mutation carriers (n = 74) and with those obtained in G88E mutation carriers. Special attention was also given to a comparison of age-related features, such as progressive hearing loss and vestibular impairment. A novel mutation (G87W) in COCH is indicative of hearing impairment and vestibular dysfunction in the present family. Pure-tone thresholds, phoneme recognition scores, and vestibular responses of the G87W mutation carriers were essentially similar to those previously established in the P51S and G88E mutation carriers. Deterioration of hearing and vestibular function in the G87W mutation carriers started at the age of 43 years. Remarkably, similar to G88E mutation carriers, the proportion of patients over 40 years of age who developed complete vestibular areflexia was significantly lower for the G87W mutation carriers than for the P51S mutation carriers. In conclusion, the phenotype associated with the novel COCH (G87W) mutation is largely similar to that associated with the P51S and G88E mutation carriers. However, subtle differences in terms of onset age and rate of progression seem to exist.	4
Molecularly targeted therapies for p53-mutant cancers. || Cell Cycle Checkpoints Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Pyrimidines TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumor suppressor p53 is lost or mutated in approximately half of human cancers. Mutant p53 not only loses its anti-tumor transcriptional activity, but also often acquires oncogenic functions to promote tumor proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. Traditional strategies have been taken to directly target p53 mutants through identifying small molecular compounds to deplete mutant p53, or to restore its tumor suppressive function. Accumulating evidence suggest that cancer cells with mutated p53 often exhibit specific functional dependencies on secondary genes or pathways to survive, providing alternative targets to indirectly treat p53-mutant cancers. Targeting these genes or pathways, critical for survival in the presence of p53 mutations, holds great promise for cancer treatment. In addition, mutant p53 often exhibits novel gain-of-functions to promote tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we review and discuss strategies targeting mutant p53, with focus on targeting the mutant p53 protein directly, and on the progress of identifying genes and pathways required in p53-mutant cells.	0
Loss of PTEN expression is an independent predictor of favourable survival in endometrial carcinomas. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Endometrial Neoplasms Female Humans Immunohistochemistry Middle Aged PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Phosphorylation Survival Analysis || We and others previously reported the prognostic significance of PTEN mutational status on favourable survival in endometrial carcinomas. Here, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN expression in immunohistochemistry is an independent prognostic marker for favourable survival in endometrial carcinomas. We conducted immunohistochemical analyses of PTEN, PIK3CA, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), and p27 in primary endometrial carcinomas from 221 patients. Mutation of PTEN was analysed further. Expression of PTEN was lost in 56 patients (25%), and PIK3CA was overexpressed in 159 patients (72%). Overexpression of PIK3CA was associated with p-Akt overexpression (P<0.001), which was in turn associated with loss of nuclear p27 expression (P=0.028). Loss of PTEN expression was found to be associated with endometrioid histology (P=0.03), and was inversely associated with the presence of lymphovascular space invasion (P=0.03). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses revealed that factors of PTEN loss, age <70, histological grade 1, early International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and absence of lymphovascular invasion were independent prognostic indicators for better overall survival (P=0.03, 0.04, 0.01, <0.001, and 0.03, respectively). The subset analysis showed a stronger tendency of PTEN loss towards favourable survival in advanced-stage (III and IV) disease than in early-stage (I and II) disease (P=0.05 vs 0.14). Moreover, our mutational analysis demonstrated that PTEN expression loss was associated with PTEN-truncating mutations (P=0.03). The current observations further support the prognostic significance of PTEN aberration on favourable outcome in endometrial carcinomas, providing useful implications for the individualised management of the disease.	4
Genetics of hearing loss in Africans: use of next generation sequencing is the best way forward. || Africa South of the Sahara African Continental Ancestry Group Connexin 30 Connexins Hearing Loss High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation || Hearing loss is the most common communication disorder affecting about 1-7/1000 births worldwide. The most affected areas are developing countries due to extensively poor health care systems. Environmental causes contribute to 50-70% of cases, specifically meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa. The other 30-50% is attributed to genetic factors. Nonsyndromic hearing loss is the most common form of hearing loss accounting for up to 70% of cases. The most common mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. The most prevalent mutations associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) are found within connexin genes such as GJB2, mostly in people of European and Asian origin. For example, the c.35delG mutation ofGJB2 is found in 70% of ARNSHL patients of European descent is rare in populations of other ethnicities. Other GJB2 mutations have been reported in various populations. The second most common mutations are found in the connexin gene, GJB6, also with a high prevalence in patients of European descent. To date more than 60 genes have been associated with ARNSHL. We previously showed that mutations in GJB2, GJB6 and GJA1 are not significant causes of ARNSHL inpatients from African descents, i.e. Cameroonians and South Africans In order to resolve ARNSHL amongst sub-Saharan African patients, additional genes would need to be explored. Currently at least 60 genes are thought to play a role in ARNSHL thus the current approach using Sanger sequencing would not be appropriate as it would be expensive and time consuming. Next Generation sequencing (NGS) provides the best alternative approach. In this review, we reported on the success of using NGSas observed in various populations and advocate for the use of NGS to resolve cases of ARNSHL in sub-Saharan African populations.	4
Prevalence of p.V37I variant of GJB2 in mild or moderate hearing loss in a pediatric population and the interpretation of its pathogenicity. || Adolescent Base Sequence Child Connexin 26 Connexins Female Gene Frequency Genetic Variation Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Pedigree || A p.V37I variant of GJB2 has been reported from subjects with moderate or slight hearing loss especially in East Asian populations. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of the p.V37I variant among such subjects and prove, epidemiologically, its pathogenic potential to cause mild hearing loss. A total of 380 subjects from 201 families with hearing loss were enrolled. From them, 103 families were selected who had autosomal recessive inheritance or sporadic occurrence of hearing loss and who were younger than 15 years old. GJB2 sequencing was carried out for the probands of all 103 families. The prevalence of the p.V37I variant was compared between the subtle, mild or moderate hearing loss (group I) and the severe or profound hearing loss (group II) groups. Where possible, a targeted next generation sequencing of 82 deafness genes was performed from the p.V37I carrier to exclude the existence of other pathogenic genes. Five (4.8%) of 103 probands were found to carry p.V37I. The carrier frequency of p.V37I among group I (18.2%) was significantly higher than that of group II (1.2%) or the reported Korean normal hearing control group (1.0%). Detection of the p.V37I variant of GJB2 in 18.2% of Koreans with mild hearing loss strongly suggests its contribution to the pathogenesis of milder hearing loss, which might justify sequencing of GJB2 from these subjects in the Korean population.	4
Prevalence of sequence variants in the RAS-mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway in pre-adolescent children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Male Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Pedigree Phenotype Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Most cases of apparently idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in children are caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes. HCM also commonly occurs as an associated feature in some patients with disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Although diagnosis of these disorders is based on typical phenotypic features, the dysmorphic manifestations can be subtle and therefore overlooked. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mutations in RAS-MAPK genes in preadolescent children with idiopathic HCM. Seventy-eight patients diagnosed with apparently nonsyndromic HCM aged ≤13 years underwent clinical and genetic evaluation. The entire protein coding sequence of 9 genes implicated in Noonan syndrome and related conditions (PTPN11, SOS1, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, RAF1, MAP2K1, and MAP2K2), together with CBL (exons 8 and 9) and SHOC2 (4A>G), were screened for mutations. Five probands (6.4%) carried novel sequence variants in SOS1 (2 individuals), BRAF, MAP2K1, and MAP2K2. Structural and molecular data suggest that these variants may have functional significance. Nine cardiac sarcomere protein genes were screened also; 2 individuals also had mutations in MYBPC. This study reports novel and potentially pathogenic sequence variants in genes of the RAS-MAPK pathway, suggesting that genetic lesions promoting signaling dysregulation through RAS contribute to disease pathogenesis or progression in children with HCM.	4
PAH mutation spectrum and correlation with PKU manifestation in north Jiangsu province population. || Child, Preschool China Female Genetic Association Studies Humans Infant Male Mutation Mutation Rate Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a common autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism and mainly results a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH). The incidence of various PAH mutations have race and ethnicity differences. We report a spectrum of PAH mutations complied from 35 PKU children who are all Chinese Han population from north Jiangsu in this study. All 13 exons and their flanking intron sequences of PAH were determined by Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencing. The relationship of genotype and phenotype was analyzed based on the sum of the arbitrary value (AV) values of the two alleles. We identified 61 mutations, with a frequency of 87.14%, among 70 alleles of 35 patients. The most prevalent mutations were R243Q (26.23%), R241C (9.84%) and V399V (8.20%). Furthermore, the consistency between prediction of the biochemical phenotype and the observed phenotype was 81.25%, with the highest consistency observed in classic PKU (87.50%). A significant correlation was found between pretreatment levels of phenylalanine and AV sum (r = -0.87, P < 0.05). Finally, our study constructs PAH mutation spectrum by next generation sequencing (NGS), and reveals that the PAH genotypes and biochemical phenotypes were significantly correlated. These offers facilitate the provision of appropriate genetic counseling for PKU patients.	1 3

Mutation analysis of the PAH gene in phenylketonuria patients from Rio de Janeiro, Southeast Brazil. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in the PAH gene. Most of the patients are compound heterozygotes, and genotype is a major factor in determining the phenotypic variability of PKU. More than 1,000 variants have been described in the PAH gene. Rio de Janeiro's population has a predominance of Iberian, followed by African and Amerindian ancestries. It is expected that most PKU variants in this Brazilian state have originated in the Iberian Peninsula. However, rare European, African or pathogenic variants that are characteristic of the admixed population of the state might also be found. A total of 102 patients were included in this study. Genomic DNA was isolated from dried blood spots. Sanger sequencing was used for PAH gene variant identification. Deletions and duplications were also screened using MLPA analysis. Haplotypes were also determined. Nine (8.8%) homozygous and 93 (91.2%) compound heterozygous patients were found. The spectrum included 37 causative mutations. Missense, nonsense, and splicing pathogenic variants corresponded to 63.7%, 2.9%, and 22.6% of the mutant alleles, respectively. Large (1.5%), and small deletions, inframe (5.4%) and with frameshift (3.9%), comprised the remainder. The most frequent pathogenic variants were: p.V388M (12.7%), p.R261Q (11.8%), IVS10-11G>A (10.3%), IVS2+5G>C (6.4%), p.S349P (6.4%), p.R252W (5.4%), p.I65T (4.4%), p.T323del (4.4%), and p.P281L (3.4%). One novel variant was detected: c.934G>T (p.G312C) [rs763115697]. The three most frequent pathogenic variants in our study (34.8% of the alleles) were also the most common in other Brazilian states, Portugal, and Spain (p.V388M, p.R261Q, IVS10-11G>A), corroborating that the Iberian Peninsula is the major source of PAH mutations in Rio de Janeiro. Pathogenic variants that have other geographical origins, such IVS2+5G>C, p.G352Vfs*48, and IVS12+1G>A were also detected. Genetic drift and founder effect may have also played a role in the mutation spectrum we observed.	1 3

Mutations in Cx30 and 31, digenic mutations as well as large deletions/duplications, are unlikely to be a major cause of hearing loss in Swiss patients with ARNHI. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a highly accurate screening method for detection of c.del(GJB6-D13S1830). The intent of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the point and digenic mutations including large deletions and duplications in the Cx26, 30, and 31 genes in a Swiss patient cohort with ARNHI and cochlear implant. The coding regions of Cx26, 30, and 31 were sequenced in 32 patients. Large deletions/duplications were assessed by MLPA. In one patient digenic heterozygous mutations involving Cx26 (c.35delG) and Cx30 (c.del(GJB6-D13S1830)) were identified. Biallelic Cx26 mutations were detected in 31%. One putative mutation (c.94C>T) was found in Cx31. MLPA analysis did not reveal any additional deletion or duplication in all three Cx genes, except for the heterozygous c.del(GJB6-D13S1830) deletion.	4
MPK-09, a small molecule inspired from bioactive styryllactone restores the wild-type function of mutant p53. || Apoptosis Blotting, Western Butyrates Cell Line, Tumor Ethers, Cyclic Flow Cytometry Fluorescent Antibody Technique Gene Deletion Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Lactones Molecular Structure Mutation Styrenes Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || In the search for more efficacious and less toxic cancer drugs, the tumor suppressor p53 protein has long been a desirable therapeutic target. In the recent past, few independent studies have demonstrated that the antitumor activity of wild-type p53 can be restored in cancer cells harboring mutant form of p53 using small molecule activators. In this study, we describe a novel small molecule MPK-09, which is selective and highly potent against allele specific p53 mutations mainly, R175H, R249S, R273H, R273C, and E285K . Except E285K, all other mutations tested are among the six "hot spot" p53 mutations reported in majority of human cancer. Furthermore, our study conclusively demonstrates that the apoptotic activity of the small molecule MPK-09 against cancer cells harboring R273C and E285K mutations is due to restoration of the wild-type conformation to the corresponding mutant form of p53.	0

Indeed, 50% of the 220 tested genes yielded detectable morphological profiles, which grouped into biologically meaningful gene clusters consistent with known functional annotation (e.g., the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade). We used novel subpopulation-based visualization methods to interpret the morphological changes for specific clusters. This unbiased morphologic map of gene function revealed TRAF2/c-REL negative regulation of YAP1/WWTR1-responsive pathways. We confirmed this discovery of functional connectivity between the NF-κB pathway and Hippo pathway effectors at the transcriptional level, thereby expanding knowledge of these two signaling pathways that critically regulate tumor initiation and progression. We make the images and raw data publicly available, providing an initial morphological map of major biological pathways for future study.	0
The analysis of three markers flanking GJB2 gene suggests a single origin of the most common 35delG mutation in the Moroccan population. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis European Continental Ancestry Group Founder Effect Genetic Markers Hearing Loss, Bilateral Homozygote Humans Incidence Minisatellite Repeats Morocco Physical Chromosome Mapping Sequence Deletion || In Caucasian populations a single mutation, 35delG, accounts for the majority of GJB2 gene mediated hearing loss, with carrier frequencies estimated between 2-4%, possibly resulting from a founder effect rather than from a mutational hot spot. In Moroccan population, the 35delG mutation accounts for 90.8% of all GJB2 mutated alleles in deaf patients with a carrier frequency of 2.65%. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the 35delG mutation has derived from a single origin in the Moroccan population. We enrolled 30 unrelated deaf patients homozygous for the 35delG mutation and 165 unrelated control individuals negative for this mutation, and genotyped three microsatellite markers flanking the GJB2 region: D13S141, D13S175 and D13S143. Data analysis revealed that the 35delG mutation is associated with particular alleles of these markers, with significant linkage disequilibrium for the 125 and 105 nucleotide long alleles of D13S141 and D13S175, and that a single specific haplotype accounts for 68% of the chromosomes carrying the 35delG mutation. The estimate age of 35delG mutation is 135 generations or approximately 2700 years old. Like in other Mediterranean populations, our results suggest that in the Moroccan population the 35delG mutation has derived from a single origin in a common founder process.	4
Clinical and genetic characterization of hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population. ||  || Breast cancer develops as a result of multiple gene mutations in combination with environmental risk factors. Causative variants in genes such as BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 have been shown to account for hereditary nature of certain breast cancers. However,other genes, such as ATM, PALB2, BRIP1, CHEK, BARD1, while lower in frequency, may also increase breast cancer risk. There are few studies examining the role of these causative variants. Our study aimed to examine the clinical and genetic characterization of hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population. We tested a panel of 27 genes implicated in breast cancer risk in 240 participants using Next-Generation Sequencing. The prevalence of genetic causative variants was determined and the association between causative variants and clinico-pathological characteristics was analyzed. Causative variant rate was 19.2% in the breast cancer (case) group and 12.5% in the high-risk group. In the case group 2.5% of patients carried BRCA1 causative variant, 7.5% BRCA2 variants, 1.7% patients had MUTYH, CHEK or PALB2 variants, and 0.8% patients carried ATM, BARD1, NBN, RAD51C or TP53 variants. In the high-risk group 5.8% women carried MUTYH causative variants, 2.5% had causative variants in ATM, 1.7% patients had variants in BRCA2 and 0.8% in BARD1, BRIP1 or CDH1. There was no significant difference in the presence of causative variants among clinical stages of breast cancer, tumor size and lymph nodes status. However, eight of the 12 BRCA1/2 causative variants were found in the TNBC group. We found increased genetic causative variants in the familial breast cancer group and in high-risk women with a family history of breast cancer. However, the variant MUTYH c.892-2A > G may not be directly associated with hereditary breast carcinoma.	4
Aberrant Apoptotic Response of Colorectal Cancer Cells to Novel Nucleoside Analogues. || Annexin A5 Apoptosis Caco-2 Cells Camptothecin Caspase 3 Caspase 8 Cell Line, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms HT29 Cells Humans Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial Mitochondria Nucleosides || Despite the increased understanding of colorectal cancer and the introduction of targeted drug therapy, the metastatic phase of the disease remains refractory to treatment. Since the deregulation of normal apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, novel nucleoside analogues were synthesized here and evaluated for their ability to induce apoptosis and cause cell death in two colorectal adeno-carcinoma cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29. Three novel nucleoside analogues assessed here showed cytotoxic activity, as measured by the MTT assay against both cell lines: the IC50 values ranged between 3 and 37 μM, with Caco-2 cells being more sensitive than HT-29 cells. Compared to camptothecin, the positive control, the nucleoside analogues were significantly less toxic to normal unstimulated leukocytes (p>0.05). Moreover, the nucleosides were able to induce apoptosis as measured by an increase in caspase 8 and caspase 3 activity above that of the control. This was additionally supported by data derived from Annexin V-FITC assays. Despite marginal changes to the mitochondrial membrane potential, all three nucleosides caused a significant increase in cytosolic cytochrome c (p>0.05), with a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome c. Morphological analysis of both cell lines showed the rapid appearance of vacuoles following exposure to two of the nucleosides, while a third caused cellular detachment, delayed cytoplasmic vacuolisation and nuclear abnormalities. Preliminary investigations, using the autophagic indicator monodansylcadaverine and chloroquine as positive control, showed that two of the nucleosides induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles. In summary, the novel nucleoside analogues showed selective cytotoxicity towards both cancer cell lines and are effective initiators of an unusual apoptotic response, demonstrating their potential to serve as structural scaffolds for more potent analogues.	0
Phenotypic Heterogeneity in a DFNA20/26 family segregating a novel ACTG1 mutation. || Actins Adolescent Adult Aged Amino Acid Sequence Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Protein Conformation Young Adult || Genetic factors play an important role in hearing loss, contributing to approximately 60% of cases of congenital hearing loss. Autosomal dominant deafness accounts for approximately 20% of cases of hereditary hearing loss. Diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance often show pleiotropy, different degrees of penetrance, and variable expressivity. A three-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment (ADNSHI) was enrolled in this study. Audiometric data and blood samples were collected from the family. In total, 129 known human deafness genes were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify the responsible gene mutation in the family. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed to exclude any other variant that cosegregated with the phenotype. The age of onset of the affected family members was the second decade of life. The condition began with high-frequency hearing impairment in all family members excluding III:2. The novel ACTG1 c.638A > G (p.K213R) mutation was found in all affected family members and was not found in the unaffected family members. A heterozygous c.638A > G mutation in ACTG1 and homozygous c.109G > A (p.V37I) mutation in GJB2 were found in III:2, who was born with hearing loss. The WES result concurred with that of targeted sequencing of known deafness genes. The novel mutation p.K213R in ACTG1 was found to be co-segregated with hearing loss and the genetic cause of ADNSHI in this family. A homozygous mutation associated with recessive inheritance only rarely co-acts with a dominant mutation to result in hearing loss in a dominant family. In such cases, the mutations in the two genes, as in ACTG1 and GJB2 in the present study, may result in a more severe phenotype. Targeted sequencing of known deafness genes is one of the best choices to identify the genetic cause in hereditary hearing loss families.	4
Audiological features of GJB2 (connexin 26) deafness. ||  || The aim of the present study was to characterize audiological profiles in patients with GJB2 deafness We screened DNA from 399 individuals with nonsyndromic deafness for mutations in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) by sequence analysis. A total of 77 (19%) of these deaf individuals were biallelic GJB2 mutations (either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations) (GJB2 deafness). Using the audiological classification criteria of genetic deafness proposed by the European Workshop on Genetic Hearing Loss, we analyzed audiograms of these patients to characterize audiological features of the GJB2 deafness. In addition, we reviewed audiological data of 411 deafness cases from the literature providing details of audiological data (including 157 with GJB2 deafness). All categories of hearing loss severity were found, with significant differences in the findings from GJB2 cases: 1 (4.5%) of 22 individuals with mild hearing loss, 10 (13.3%) of 75 with moderate loss, 14 (14.9%) of 94 with severe loss, and 52 (25%) of 208 with profound deafness (Chi-square test, 3 df, p = 0.016). 81.6% of patients with GJB2 mutations had severe to profound loss, 18.4% with mild to moderate loss (Chi-square test, p = 0.014). The 235delC mutation was always associated with profound deafness. The main audiogram shapes found were residual/sloping (72.7%) and flat (23.4%). There were no differences in the severity and audiogram shapes of the hearing impairment between homozygous and compound heterozygous GJB2 deafness (Chi-square test, p > 0.05). Our study shows that the probability of finding biallelic GJB2 mutations increases with the severity of hearing loss. Audiograms associated with GJB2 deafness were usually nonspecific. Patients with unknown causes of severe or profound hearing loss should be routinely tested for GJB2 mutations, but due to the variability in hearing loss, individuals with lesser degrees of hearing loss should not be precluded from testing.	4
Diseases associated with leaky hemichannels. ||  || Hemichannels (HCs) and gap junction channels (GJCs) formed by protein subunits called connexins (Cxs) are major pathways for intercellular communication. While HCs connect the intracellular compartment with the extracellular milieu, GJCs allow the interchange of molecules between cytoplasm of two contacting cells. Under physiological conditions, HCs are mostly closed, but they can open under certain stimuli allowing the release of autocrine and paracrine molecules. Moreover, some pathological conditions, like ischemia or other inflammation conditions, significantly increase HCs activity. In addition, some mutations in Cx genes associated with human diseases, such as deafness or cataracts, lead to the formation of more active HCs or "leaky HCs." In this article we will revise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the appearance of leaky HCs, and the consequences of their expression in different cellular systems and animal models, in seeking a common pattern or pathological mechanism of disease.	0

[A simple and reliable method for detection of the R408W mutation in exon 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in the molecular diagnosis of phenylketonuria]. || Alleles DNA Exons Female Humans Mutation Nucleic Acid Hybridization Pedigree Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis Reproducibility of Results || A new method for identification of R408W mutation common in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Russia and Eastern Europe is presented. The method is based on restriction of amplified exon 12. Amplification was achieved by PCR and was followed by restriction with StyI endonuclease. This enzyme specifically recognized allele R408W (C-T change in the position 1444 of the PAH gene) but not the normal allele. The method is easily reproduced both in DNA samples and in blood spots on the blotting paper (Gathrie cards) as well as in native cells from chorionic villi samples and amniocytes without preliminary DNA extraction. The method is very reliable and quick and has obvious advantages over other methods (ASO, ARMS) routinely used for identification of R408W mutation in the PKU high risk families.	3
An integrated diagnosis strategy for congenital myopathies. || Adult Base Sequence Biopsy DNA Mutational Analysis Exome Female Humans Male Molecular Sequence Data Muscles Muscular Diseases Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Sequence Analysis, DNA || Congenital myopathies are severe muscle disorders affecting adults as well as children in all populations. The diagnosis of congenital myopathies is constrained by strong clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Moreover, the majority of patients present with unspecific histological features, precluding purposive molecular diagnosis and demonstrating the need for an alternative and more efficient diagnostic approach. We used exome sequencing complemented by histological and ultrastructural analysis of muscle biopsies to identify the causative mutations in eight patients with clinically different skeletal muscle pathologies, ranging from a fatal neonatal myopathy to a mild and slowly progressive myopathy with adult onset. We identified RYR1 (ryanodine receptor) mutations in six patients and NEB (nebulin) mutations in two patients. We found novel missense and nonsense mutations, unraveled small insertions/deletions and confirmed their impact on splicing and mRNA/protein stability. Histological and ultrastructural findings of the muscle biopsies of the patients validated the exome sequencing results. We provide the evidence that an integrated strategy combining exome sequencing with clinical and histopathological investigations overcomes the limitations of the individual approaches to allow a fast and efficient diagnosis, accelerating the patient's access to a better healthcare and disease management. This is of particular interest for the diagnosis of congenital myopathies, which involve very large genes like RYR1 and NEB as well as genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity.	4
The G/A nucleotide change at cDNA position 2494 in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1): analysis in Italian patients. ||  || Current studies are investigating new E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mutations that may be responsible for diffuse gastric cancer susceptibility. Recently, a novel CDH1 germline variant presenting a G/A nucleotide change at cDNA position 2494 has been found in Japanese patients with familial diffuse gastric cancer. The consequent amino acid variation (Val/Met) may alter the binding activity to beta-catenin and the adhesive function of the E-cadherin protein. We have investigated its frequency in Italian cases of sporadic diffuse gastric cancer a well as in healthy controls. Peripheral blood samples were collected from consecutive patients with sporadic, diffuse gastric cancer and from healthy controls in the District of Urbino, Marche Region, Central Italy. After DNA extraction, standard techniques for molecular analyses were used to investigate the 2494 G/A germline nucleotide change in CDH1 cDNA. None of the 48 patients and 48 controls showed the G/A 2494 nucleotide change. Assuming a binomial distribution of the mutation among individuals and the absence of mutations in the 48 patients, the 95% upper bound for the underlying mutation frequency was 7.4%. The novel CDH1 nucleotide change is uncommon in Italian patients with sporadic diffuse gastric cancer. Given these results, further analyses in large population-based studies are not advisable.	4
Novel mutations in GJB6 and GJB2 in Clouston syndrome. || Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Ectodermal Dysplasia Female Humans Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Nail Diseases || Clouston syndrome (CS; also termed hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic skin disorder, characterized by alopecia, nail dystrophy, and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Mutations in the GJB6 gene, which encodes the gap junction protein connexin 30, have been shown to cause this disorder. To date, four mutations of GJB6 have been found in patients with CS: G11R, V37E, D50N and A88V. Mutations in GJA1 (V41L) and GJB2 (R127H) are also related to CS. We found a novel missense mutation, N14S, in GJB6 and the previously identified F191L mutation in GJB2 (Cx26) in a proband with CS in a Han Chinese pedigree; these mutations were not found in 200 ethnically matched nonconsanguineous Han Chinese controls.	4
13C-phenylalanine breath test and serum biopterin in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. ||  || Phenylalanine is required for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline. The rate-limiting step for phenylalanine metabolism is catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin. We aimed to detect altered phenylalanine metabolism in major psychiatric disorders using the l-[1-13C]phenylalanine breath test (13C-PBT) and serum biopterin levels. We also investigated association of PAH mutations with schizophrenia and phenylalanine metabolism.13C-phenylalanine (100 mg) was orally administered, and the breath13CO2/12CO2 ratio was monitored for 120 min in four groups: 103 patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV), 39 with bipolar disorder, 116 with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 241 healthy controls. Serum biopterin levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Mutation screening of PAH exons was performed by direct sequencing in 46 schizophrenia patients. Association analysis was performed using six tag single nucleotide polymorphisms and the PAH Arg53His mutation by TaqMan assays in 616 schizophrenia patients and 1194 healthy controls. Analyses of covariance controlling for age, sex, and body weight showed that the index for the amount of exhaled13CO2 was significantly lower in the schizophrenia group than in the other three groups (all p < 0.05). Biopterin levels in schizophrenia and MDD were significantly lower than those in controls. Biopterin levels correlated with13C-PBT indices in controls. PAH polymorphisms were not associated with schizophrenia or13C-PBT indices.13C-PBT revealed reduced phenylalanine metabolism in schizophrenia, though we obtained no evidence of involvement of PAH polymorphism. Serum biopterin levels were lower in schizophrenia and MDD, warranting further investigation.	3
Comparison of Glycomacropeptide with Phenylalanine Free-Synthetic Amino Acids in Test Meals to PKU Patients: No Significant Differences in Biomarkers, Including Plasma Phe Levels. ||  || Management of phenylketonuria (PKU) is achieved through low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet, supplemented with low-protein food and mixture of free-synthetic (FS) amino acid (AA). Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) is a natural peptide released in whey during cheese-making and does not contain Phe. Lacprodan® CGMP-20 used in this study contained a small amount of Phe due to minor presence of other proteins/peptides. The purpose of this study was to compare absorption of CGMP-20 to FSAA with the aim of evaluating short-term effects on plasma AAs as well as biomarkers related to food intake. This study included 8 patients, who had four visits and tested four drink mixtures (DM1-4), consisting of CGMP, FSAA, or a combination. Plasma blood samples were collected at baseline, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes (min) after the meal. AA profiles and ghrelin were determined 6 times, while surrogate biomarkers were determined at baseline and 240 min. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for evaluation of taste and satiety. The surrogate biomarker concentrations and VAS scores for satiety and taste were nonsignificant between the four DMs, and there were only few significant results for AA profiles (not Phe). CGMP and FSAA had the overall same nonsignificant short-term effect on biomarkers, including Phe. This combination of FSAA and CGMP is a suitable supplement for PKU patients.	1 3
Bipartite tetracysteine display requires site flexibility for ReAsH coordination. || Amino Acid Sequence Arsenicals Binding Sites Cysteine Fluorescent Dyes Green Fluorescent Proteins Oxazines Protein Binding Protein Folding Protein Structure, Tertiary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Flexibility required: We designed intramolecular bipartite tetracysteine sites in loops of p53 and the beta-sheets of EmGFP. We found that ReAsH binding preferentially favors tetracysteine sites with flexible geometries such as loops; flexibility was assessed by comparing Calpha B-factor values. This information is important for directing successful bipartite tetracysteine site designs.	0
Anchoring proteins as regulators of signaling pathways. || A Kinase Anchor Proteins Animals Arrhythmias, Cardiac Cardiomegaly Cyclic AMP Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases Enzyme Activation Heart Failure Heart Rate Humans Multiprotein Complexes Myocardial Contraction Myocardium Oxidative Stress Signal Transduction || Spatial and temporal organization of signal transduction is coordinated through the segregation of signaling enzymes in selected cellular compartments. This highly evolved regulatory mechanism ensures the activation of selected enzymes only in the vicinity of their target proteins. In this context, cAMP-responsive triggering of protein kinase A is modulated by a family of scaffold proteins referred to as A-kinase anchoring proteins. A-kinase anchoring proteins form the core of multiprotein complexes and enable simultaneous but segregated cAMP signaling events to occur in defined cellular compartments. In this review we will focus on the description of A-kinase anchoring protein function in the regulation of cardiac physiopathology.	0
Clinical utility of genetic tests for inherited hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. || Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Humans Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity || Genetic testing has become an increasingly important part of medical practice for heritable form of cardiomyopathies. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and about 50% of idiopathic dilatative cardiomyopathy are familial diseases, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.Some genotype-phenotype correlations can provide important information to target DNA analyses in specific genes. Genetic testing may clarify diagnosis and help the optimal treatment strategies for more malignant phenotypes. In addition, genetic screening of first-degree relatives can help early identification and diagnosis of individuals at greatest risk for developing cardiomyopathy, allowing to focus clinical resources on high-risk family members.This paper provides a concise overview of the genetic etiology as well as the clinical utilities and limitations of genetic testing for the heritable cardiomyopathies.	4
HSPB8 and BAG3 cooperate to promote spatial sequestration of ubiquitinated proteins and coordinate the cellular adaptive response to proteasome insufficiency. || aggresome molecular chaperones p62 SQSTM1 proteotoxic stress small HSP || BCL2-associated athanogene (BAG)-3 is viewed as a platform that would physically and functionally link distinct classes of molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein (HSP) family for the stabilization and clearance of damaged proteins. In this study, we show that HSPB8, a member of the small heat shock protein subfamily, cooperates with BAG3 to coordinate the sequestration of harmful proteins and the cellular adaptive response upon proteasome inhibition. Silencing of HSPB8, like depletion of BAG3, inhibited targeting of ubiquitinated proteins to the juxtanuclear aggresome, a mammalian system of spatial quality control. However, aggresome targeting was restored in BAG3-depleted cells by a mutant BAG3 defective in HSPB8 binding, uncoupling HSPB8 function from its binding to BAG3. Depletion of HSPB8 impaired formation of ubiquitinated microaggregates in an early phase and interfered with accurate modifications of the stress sensor p62/sequestosome (SQSTM)-1. This impairment correlated with decreased coupling of BAG3 to p62/SQSTM1 in response to stress, hindering Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (KEAP)-1 sequestration and stabilization of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf)-2, an important arm of the antioxidant defense. Notably, the myopathy-associated mutation of BAG3 (P209L), which lies within the HSPB8-binding motif, deregulated the association between BAG3 and p62/SQSTM1 and the KEAP1-Nrf2 signaling axis. Together, our findings support a so-far-unrecognized role for the HSPB8-BAG3 connection in mounting of an efficient stress response, which may be involved in BAG3-related human diseases.-Guilbert, S. M., Lambert, H., Rodrigue, M.-A., Fuchs, M., Landry, J., Lavoie, J. N.

A protein folding molecular imaging biosensor monitors the effects of drugs that restore mutant p53 structure and its downstream function in glioblastoma cells. ||  || Misfolding mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 alter its conformation, affecting the efficiency with which it binds to chromatin to regulate target gene expression and cell cycle checkpoint functions in many cancers, including glioblastoma. Small molecule drugs that recover misfolded p53 structure and function may improve chemotherapy by activating p53-mediated senescence. We constructed and optimized a split Renilla luciferase (RLUC) complementation molecular biosensor (NRLUC-p53-CRLUC) to determine small molecule-meditated folding changes in p53 protein. After initial evaluation of the biosensor in three different cells lines, we engineered endogenously p53P98L mutant (i.e. not affecting the DNA-binding domain) Ln229 glioblastoma cells, to express the biosensor containing one of four different p53 proteins: p53wt, p53Y220C, p53G245S and p53R282W. We evaluated the consequent phenotypic changes in these four variant cells as well as the parental cells after exposure to PhiKan083 and SCH529074, drugs previously reported to activate mutant p53 folding. Specifically, we measured induced RLUC complementation and consequent therapeutic response. Upon stable transduction with the p53 biosensors, we demonstrated that these originally p53P98L Ln229 cells had acquired p53 cellular phenotypes representative of each p53 protein expressed within the biosensor fusion protein. In these engineered variants we found a differential drug response when treated with doxorubicin and temozolomide, either independently or in combination with PhiKan083 or SCH529074. We thus developed a molecular imaging complementation biosensor that mimics endogenous p53 function for use in future applications to screen novel or repurposed drugs that counter the effects of misfolding mutations responsible for oncogenic structural changes in p53.	0
Vermont: a multi-perspective visual interactive platform for mutational analysis. || Amino Acid Sequence Conserved Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Humans Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Alignment Software Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || A huge amount of data about genomes and sequence variation is available and continues to grow on a large scale, which makes experimentally characterizing these mutations infeasible regarding disease association and effects on protein structure and function. Therefore, reliable computational approaches are needed to support the understanding of mutations and their impacts. Here, we present VERMONT 2.0, a visual interactive platform that combines sequence and structural parameters with interactive visualizations to make the impact of protein point mutations more understandable. We aimed to contribute a novel visual analytics oriented method to analyze and gain insight on the impact of protein point mutations. To assess the ability of VERMONT to do this, we visually examined a set of mutations that were experimentally characterized to determine if VERMONT could identify damaging mutations and why they can be considered so. VERMONT allowed us to understand mutations by interpreting position-specific structural and physicochemical properties. Additionally, we note some specific positions we believe have an impact on protein function/structure in the case of mutation.	0
Exploratory screening for Fabry's disease in young adults with cerebrovascular disorders in northern Sardinia. || Adolescent Adult Cerebrovascular Disorders Cohort Studies Fabry Disease Female Humans Italy Male Middle Aged Mutation Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || The etiologic determinants of stroke in young adults remain a diagnostic challenge in up to one-fourth of cases. Increasing evidences led to consider Fabry's disease (FD) as a possible cause to check up. We aimed at evaluating the prevalence of unrecognized FD in a cohort of patients with juvenile stroke in northern Sardinia. For this study, we enrolled 178 patients consecutively admitted to our Neurological Ward for ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, intracerebral haemorrhage, neuroradiological evidence of silent infarcts, or white matter lesions possibly related to cerebral vasculopathy at brain MRI, and cerebral venous thrombosis. The qualifying events have to occur between 18 and 55 years of age. We identified two patients with an α-galactosidase A gene variant, with a prevalence of 0.9 %. According to recent diagnostic criteria, one patient, included for the occurrence of multiple white matter lesions at brain MRI, had a diagnosis of definite FD, the other, included for ischemic stroke, had a diagnosis of uncertain FD. Our study places in a middle position among studies that found a prevalence of FD up to 4 % and others that did not find any FD patients. Our findings confirm that FD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with juvenile stroke, particularly those with a personal or familial history positive for cerebrovascular events, or evidence of combined cardiologic and/or renal impairment. All types of cerebrovascular disorders should be screened for FD, including patients with white matter lesions possibly related to cerebral vasculopathy at brain MRI.	4
Mutation analysis of key genes in RAS/RAF and PI3K/PTEN pathways in Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. ||  || The RAS/RAF and PI3K/PTEN signaling pathways play central roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. KRAS,NRAS,HRAS,BRAF,PIK3CA,PIK3R1 andPTEN are key cancer-related genes in the RAS/RAF and PI3K/PTEN signaling pathways. Genetic alterations in these genes often lead to the dysregulation of the two cascades. Little is known regarding the frequency of hotspot mutations in these critical components among Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the current study, 57 somatic hotspot mutations in 36 HCCs samples collected from Chinese patients using direct DNA sequencing method were examined. Two cases ofKRAS somatic mutations (KRAS codon 61; Gln to His) were identified among 36 HCCs (5.6%). However, no mutations were found in theNRAS,HRAS,BRAF,PIK3CA,PIK3R1 andPTEN genes. These findings indicated that point mutations in theKRAS gene, but not mutations inNRAS,HRAS,BRAF,PIK3CA,PIK3R1 andPTEN genes, at a somatic level contribute to the abnormal activation of the RAS/RAF and PI3K/PTEN pathways in HCC.	4
NDRG1 links p53 with proliferation-mediated centrosome homeostasis and genome stability. || Aneuploidy Animals Breast Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line Cell Proliferation Centrosome Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genome Heterozygote Homeostasis Homozygote Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mice Mice, Knockout Neoplasms Phenotype RNA Interference Tubulin Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumor protein 53 (TP53) tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently somatically altered gene in human cancers. Here we show expression of N-Myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is induced by p53 during physiologic low proliferative states, and mediates centrosome homeostasis, thus maintaining genome stability. When placed in physiologic low-proliferating conditions, human TP53 null cells fail to increase expression of NDRG1 compared with isogenic wild-type controls and TP53 R248W knockin cells. Overexpression and RNA interference studies demonstrate that NDRG1 regulates centrosome number and amplification. Mechanistically, NDRG1 physically associates with γ-tubulin, a key component of the centrosome, with reduced association in p53 null cells. Strikingly, TP53 homozygous loss was mutually exclusive of NDRG1 overexpression in over 96% of human cancers, supporting the broad applicability of these results. Our study elucidates a mechanism of how TP53 loss leads to abnormal centrosome numbers and genomic instability mediated by NDRG1.	0
SNaPshot reveals high mutation and carrier frequencies of 15 common hearing loss mutants in a Chinese newborn cohort. || Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group China Cohort Studies Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation || Genetic causes account for more than half of congenital hearing loss cases. The most frequent mutations found in non-syndromic hearing loss patients occur in GJB2 and SLC26A4. Mitochondrial genome mutations are also prevalent. However, the frequency of common hearing loss mutations in the Chinese population has not yet been well estimated. Here, we implemented the SNaPshot genotyping method to investigate the carrier frequency of 15 commonly reported hearing loss mutations in GJB2, SLC26A4 and the mitochondrial genome based on a cohort of 5800 neonates in China. Up to 15.9% (923/5800) of the newborns carry at least one mutant allele. The top three were GJB2-c.109G>A, GJB2-c.235delC, and SLC26A4-c.919A>G, with notably high carrier frequencies of 1/10, 1/53 and 1/62 respectively, and mt-7444G>A with 1/141 was the most frequent allele in the mitochondrial genome. In this cohort, 0.48% (28/5800) of neonates were genetically diagnosed with hearing loss, from which seven cases failed an OAE test. This is the first epidemiological study of non-syndromic hearing loss in Chinese newborns indicating a notably high carrier frequency (1 per 6.3 newborns) among these 15 mutant alleles. Our carrier frequency data also aid in effective risk assessment and genetic counseling for hearing loss patients in the Chinese population.	4
The novel mitochondrial 16S rRNA 2336T>C mutation is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mitochondrial Proteins Mutation Pedigree Phenotype RNA, Ribosomal, 16S || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disorder characterised by asymmetric thickening of septum and left ventricular wall, with a prevalence of 0.2% in the general population. To describe a novel mitochondrial DNA mutation and its association with the pathogenesis of HCM. All maternal members of a Chinese family with maternally transmitted HCM exhibited variable severity and age at onset, and were implanted permanent pacemakers due to complete atrioventricular block (AVB). Nuclear gene screening (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2 and TNNI3) was performed, and no potential pathogenic mutation was identified. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing analysis identified a novel homoplasmic 16S rRNA 2336T>C mutation. This mutation was exclusively present in maternal members and absent in non-maternal members. Conservation index by comparison to 16 other vertebrates was 94.1%. This mutation disturbs the 2336U-A2438 base pair in the stem-loop structure of 16S rRNA domain III, which is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial ribosome. Oxygen consumption rate of the lymphoblastoid cells carrying 2336T>C mutation had decreased by 37% compared with controls. A reduction in mitochondrial ATP synthesis and an increase in reactive oxidative species production were also observed. Electron microscopic analysis indicated elongated mitochondria and abnormal mitochondrial cristae shape in mutant cells. It is suggested that the 2336T>C mutation is one of pathogenic mutations of HCM. This is the first report of mitochondrial 16S rRNA 2336T>C mutation and an association with maternally inherited HCM combined with AVB. Our findings provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of HCM.	4
N-RAS mutations and susceptibility to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in human melanoma. ||  || RAS oncogene expression has been reported to affect several biological features of rodent tumours cells, including lysability by activated natural killer cells. In order to examine whether expression of mutated RAS genes in human melanoma cells alters their susceptibility to lysis by LAK cells, seven melanoma lines were assessed for the presence of Ki- and N-RAS genes bearing all possible mutations at codons 12, 13 and 61. A panel of 21 clones deriving from the metastatic lesion Me665/2, which had a Gln-->Arg substitution at codon 61 of N-RAS (N-RAS/61+), were also examined. Melanoma cells and clones were used as targets of allogeneic LAK in a 4-h 51Cr-release assay. LAK showed a higher lysis on melanoma lines and clones harbouring a mutated RAS compared with counterparts bearing no RAS mutations. In addition, LAK-mediated lysis drastically decreased on Me665/2 sublines progressively selected by exposure to LAK. This loss was paralleled by a reduction or even disappearance of N-RAS/61+ mRNA signal in Me665/2 sublines. To evaluate whether N-RAS could directly modulate LAK susceptibility to lysis, N-RAS/61+ gene was transfected in two N-RAS wild type (N-RAS/61-) 665/2 melanoma clones by a cosmid vector. In contrast to the high lysability of melanoma cells constitutively expressing the mutationally active N-RAS oncogene, N-RAS/61+ transfectants did not show a consistent high lysability by LAK, compared with some control pSV2neo transfectants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
Smad proteins bind a conserved RNA sequence to promote microRNA maturation by Drosha. || Cells, Cultured Humans Matrix Metalloproteinases, Secreted MicroRNAs Protein Binding Proteins RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional RNA-Binding Proteins Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid Ribonuclease III Smad Proteins Transforming Growth Factor beta || The signal transducers of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), the Smads, promote the expression of a subset of miRNAs by facilitating the cleavage reaction by Drosha. The mechanism that limits Smad-mediated processing to a selective group of miRNAs remained hitherto unexplored. In this study, we expand the number of TGFbeta/BMP-regulated miRNAs (T/B-miRs) to 20. Of interest, a majority of T/B-miRs contain a consensus sequence (R-SBE) within the stem region of the primary transcripts of T/B-miRs (pri-T/B-miRs). Here, we demonstrate that Smads directly bind the R-SBE. Mutation of the R-SBE abrogates TGFbeta/BMP-induced recruitment of Smads, Drosha, and DGCR8 to pri-T/B-miRs and impairs their processing, whereas introduction of R-SBE to unregulated pri-miRNAs is sufficient to recruit Smads and to allow regulation by TGFbeta/BMP. Thus, Smads are multifunctional proteins that modulate gene expression transcriptionally through DNA binding and posttranscriptionally through pri-miRNA binding and regulation of miRNA processing.	0
An individually, modified approach to desensitize infants and young children with Pompe disease, and significant reactions to alglucosidase alfa infusions. || Child Desensitization, Immunologic Enzyme Replacement Therapy Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Immunoglobulin E Infant Infusions, Intravenous Male Precision Medicine Recurrence alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease (PD) is a progressive metabolic myopathy for which the only available treatment is alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has improved ventilator-free survival, and cardiac and motor functions in patients with infantile PD. However, for an adequate response to occur, a large amount of enzymes must be infused. In some patients, this may be problematic due to infusion-associated reactions (IARs) occurring in approximately 50% of patients receiving alglucosidase alfa infusions. Whilst the majority of these reactions are mild, life threatening hypersensitivity reactions may occur in some patients. In these patients desensitization is indicated to enable continued ERT safely. Infants and young children with PD and significant infusion reactions pose unique management challenges because of their young age, limited communication skills, variable presentation and underlying cardiomyopathy. In 2 patients with PD who experienced significant ERT-related reactions: an infant (IgE positive) and a young child (IgE negative), we implemented a desensitization protocol, that started by administering a reduced dose of alglucosidase alfa (10 mg/kg weekly) instead of the standard (20 mg/kg bi-weekly) using serial micro-dilutions that were individually prepared and delivered in a highly regulated manner based on patients' clinical manifestations and tolerance. Successful desensitization was achieved in both patients, allowing them to eventually continue to receive the full dose of ERT safely. Therapeutic demands in infants and young children with PD need to be tailored according to the patient presentation, and underlying cardiac and fluid-volume status. Desensitization allowed both patients to continue alglucosidase alfa treatment at the recommended dose without prolonged interruption of therapy, or further reactions.	1
TP53 alterations in Wilms tumour represent progression events with strong intratumour heterogeneity that are closely linked but not limited to anaplasia. ||  || TP53 mutations have been associated with anaplasia in Wilms tumour, which conveys a high risk for relapse and fatal outcome. Nevertheless, TP53 alterations have been reported in no more than 60% of anaplastic tumours, and recent data have suggested their presence in tumours that do not fulfil the criteria for anaplasia, questioning the clinical utility of TP53 analysis. Therefore, we characterized the TP53 status in 84 fatal cases of Wilms tumour, irrespective of histological subtype. We identified TP53 alterations in at least 90% of fatal cases of anaplastic Wilms tumour, and even more when diffuse anaplasia was present, indicating a very strong if not absolute coupling between anaplasia and deregulation of p53 function. Unfortunately, TP53 mutations do not provide additional predictive value in anaplastic tumours since the same mutation rate was found in a cohort of non-fatal anaplastic tumours. When classified according to tumour stage, patients with stage I diffuse anaplastic tumours still had a high chance of survival (87%), but this rate dropped to 26% for stages II-IV. Thus, volume of anaplasia or possible spread may turn out to be critical parameters. Importantly, among non-anaplastic fatal tumours, 26% had TP53 alterations, indicating that TP53 screening may identify additional cases at risk. Several of these non-anaplastic tumours fulfilled some criteria for anaplasia, for example nuclear unrest, suggesting that such partial phenotypes should be under special scrutiny to enhance detection of high-risk tumours via TP53 screening. A major drawback is that these alterations are secondary changes that occur only later in tumour development, leading to striking intratumour heterogeneity that requires multiple biopsies and analysis guided by histological criteria. In conclusion, we found a very close correlation between histological signs of anaplasia and TP53 alterations. The latter may precede development of anaplasia and thereby provide diagnostic value pointing towards aggressive disease.	4
A p53/miRNA-34 axis regulates Snail1-dependent cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition. || Apoptosis Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells Humans Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 MicroRNAs Microscopy, Confocal Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasms Snail Family Transcription Factors Transcription Factors Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 beta Catenin || Snail1 is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor whose pathological expression has been linked to cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs and the induction of tissue-invasive activity, but pro-oncogenic events capable of regulating Snail1 activity remain largely uncharacterized. Herein, we demonstrate that p53 loss-of-function or mutation promotes cancer cell EMT by de-repressing Snail1 protein expression and activity. In the absence of wild-type p53 function, Snail1-dependent EMT is activated in colon, breast, and lung carcinoma cells as a consequence of a decrease in miRNA-34 levels, which suppress Snail1 activity by binding to highly conserved 3' untranslated regions in Snail1 itself as well as those of key Snail1 regulatory molecules, including β-catenin, LEF1, and Axin2. Although p53 activity can impact cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair pathways, the EMT and invasion programs initiated by p53 loss of function or mutation are completely dependent on Snail1 expression. These results identify a new link between p53, miR-34, and Snail1 in the regulation of cancer cell EMT programs.	0
[High prevalence of connexin-26 (GJB2) mutation in cochlear implant recipients]. ||  || To determine the prevalence of GJB2 gene mutations in patients undergoing cochlear implantation. We enrolled 115 cochlear implant recipients for mutation screening. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of all patients, amplified in PCR and analyzed for single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or direct sequencing to detect mutations of GJB2 gene. The result shows that the GJB2 mutations are detected in 36.5% (42/115) of the cochlear implant recipients, and especially 41% (41/100) of the non-syndromic deafness patients, only 1 inner ear malformation patient was detected with GJB2 mutations. This study found 11 different variations in the GJB2 gene. The 235delC mutation was the most prevalent mutation accounting for 18.3% (41/230) in all cochlear implant recipients and 21% (42/200) in non-syndromic deafness group. 187G > T and 230G > A mutations were novel mutation of GJB2 gene in the Chinese population. Mutations in the GJB2 gene were a major cause of deafness in cochlear implant recipients, the carrier frequency of 235delC mutation was highest.	4
Mutant and Wild-Type Tumor Suppressor p53 Induces p300 Autoacetylation. ||  || The transcriptional co-activator p300 is essential for p53 transactivation, although its precise role remains unclear. We report that p53 activates the acetyltransferase activity of p300 through the enhancement of p300 autoacetylation. Autoacetylated p300 accumulates near the transcription start sites accompanied by a similar enrichment of activating histone marks near those sites. Abrogation of p53-p300 interaction by a site-directed peptide inhibitor abolished p300-mediated histone acetylation, suggesting a crucial role played by the activation in p53-mediated gene regulation. Gain-of-function mutant p53, known to impart aggressive proliferative properties in tumor cells, also activates p300 autoacetylation. The same peptide abolished many of the gain-of-function properties of mutant p53 as well. Reversal of gain-of-function properties of mutant p53 suggests that molecules targeting the p53-p300 interface may be good candidates for anti-tumor drugs.	0
Digenic mutations involving both the BSND and GJB2 genes detected in Bartter syndrome type IV. || Bartter Syndrome Child, Preschool Chloride Channels Connexins Exons Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Homozygote Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Mutation || Bartter syndrome type IV, characterized by salt-losing nephropathies and sensorineural deafness, is caused by mutations of BSND or simultaneous mutations of both CLCNKA and CLCNKB. GJB2 is the primary causative gene for non-syndromic sensorineural deafness and associated with several syndromic sensorineural deafness. Owing to the rarity of Bartter syndrome, only a few mutations have been reported in the abovementioned causative genes. To investigate the underlying mutations in a Chinese patient with Bartter syndrome type IV, genetic analysis of BSND, CLCNKA, CLCNKB and GJB2 were performed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Finally, double homozygous mutations c.22C > T (p.Arg8Trp) and c.127G > A (Val43Ile) were detected in exon 1 of BSND. Intriguingly, compound heterozygous mutations c.235delC (p.Leu79CysfsX3) and c.109G > A (p.Val37Ile) were also revealed in exon 2 of GJB2 in the same patient. No pathogenic mutations were found in CLCNKA and CLCNKB. Our results indicated that the homozygous mutation c.22C > T was the key genetic reason for the proband, and a digenic effect of BSND and GJB2 might contributed to sensorineural deafness. To our knowledge, it was the first report showing that the GJB2 gene mutations were detected in Bartter syndrome.	4
Personalized Medicine in the Oncology Clinic: Implementation and Outcomes of the Johns Hopkins Molecular Tumor Board. ||  || Tumor genomic profiling for personalized oncology therapy is being widely applied in clinical practice even as it is being evaluated more formally in clinical trials. Given the complexities of genomic data and its application to clinical use, molecular tumor boards with diverse expertise can provide guidance to oncologists and patients seeking to implement personalized genetically targeted therapy in practice. A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board reviewed tumor molecular profiling reports from consecutive referrals at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins over a 3-year period. The tumor board weighed evidence for actionability of genomic alterations identified by molecular profiling and provided recommendations including US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug therapy, clinical trials of matched targeted therapy, off-label use of such therapy, and additional tumor or germline genetic testing. One hundred fifty-five patients were reviewed. Actionable genomic alterations were identified in 132 patients (85%). Off-label therapies were recommended in 37 patients (24%). Eleven patients were treated off-label, and 13 patients were enrolled onto clinical trials of matched targeted therapies. Median progression-free survival of patients treated with matched therapies was 5 months (95% CI, 2.9 months to not reached), and the progression-free survival probability at 6 months was 43%(95% CI, 26% to 71%). Lack of locally available clinical trials was the major limitation on clinical actionability of tumor profiling reports. The molecular tumor board recommended off-label targeted therapies for a quarter of all patients reviewed. Outcomes were heterogeneous, although 43% of patients receiving genomically matched therapy derived clinical benefit lasting at least 6 months. Until more data become available from precision oncology trials, molecular tumor boards can help guide appropriate use of tumor molecular testing to direct therapy.	4
Comparing mutation calls in fixed tumour samples between the affymetrix OncoScan® array and PCR based next-generation sequencing. || DNA Mutational Analysis High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Neoplasms Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Polymerase Chain Reaction || The importance of accurate and affordable mutation calling in fixed pathology samples is becoming increasingly important as we move into the era of personalised medicine. The Affymetrix OncoScan® Array platform is designed to produce actionable mutation calls in archival material. We compared calls made using the OncoScan platform with calls made using a custom designed PCR panel followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), in order to benchmark the sensitivity and specificity of the OncoScan calls in a large cohort of fixed tumour samples. 392 fixed, clinical samples were sequenced, encompassing 641 PCR regions, 403 putative positive calls and 1528 putative negative calls. A small number of mutations could not be validated, either due to large indels or pseudogenes impairing parts of the NGS pipeline. For the remainder, if calls were filtered according to simple quality metrics, both sensitivity and specificity for the OncoScan platform were over 98%. This applied even to samples with poorer sample quality and lower variant allele frequency (5-10%) than product claims indicated. This benchmarking study will be useful to users and potential users of this platform, who wish to compare technologies or interpret their own results.	4

Clinical features of Pompe disease. || Age of Onset Diagnosis, Differential Genetic Predisposition to Disease Glycogen Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Lysosomes Muscle Weakness Mutation Prognosis alpha-Glucosidases || Glycogen storage disease type II - also called Pompe disease or acid maltase deficiency - is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, caused by an accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome due to deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme. Pompe disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the acid α-glucosidase (GAA), located on chromosome 17q25.2-q25.3. The different disease phenotypes are related to the levels of residual GAA activity in muscles. The clinical spectrum ranging from the classical form with early onset and severe phenotype to not-classical form with later onset and milder phenotype is described.	1

In addition clinical severity and disease progression are greatly variable. We report on a family with 3 siblings characterized by an unusual adult-onset Pompe disease including dysphagia and weakness of tongue, axial and limb-girdle muscles, in association with atypical globular inclusions in muscle fibres. Our study confirms the great clinical and histological variability of adult-onset Pompe disease and further supports the need of careful evaluation of bulbar function in patients affected by this pathology.	1
Inhibiting the system xC-/glutathione axis selectively targets cancers with mutant-p53 accumulation. || Amino Acid Transport System y+ Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Glutathione Humans Lipid Peroxidation Models, Biological Mutation NF-E2-Related Factor 2 Oxidative Stress Quinuclidines Reactive Oxygen Species Stress, Physiological Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53, a critical tumour suppressor gene, is mutated in over half of all cancers resulting in mutant-p53 protein accumulation and poor patient survival. Therapeutic strategies to target mutant-p53 cancers are urgently needed. We show that accumulated mutant-p53 protein suppresses the expression of SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xC-, through binding to the master antioxidant transcription factor NRF2. This diminishes glutathione synthesis, rendering mutant-p53 tumours susceptible to oxidative damage. System xC- inhibitors specifically exploit this vulnerability to preferentially kill cancer cells with stabilized mutant-p53 protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLC7A11 expression is a novel and robust predictive biomarker for APR-246, a first-in-class mutant-p53 reactivator that also binds and depletes glutathione in tumours, triggering lipid peroxidative cell death. Importantly, system xC- antagonism strongly synergizes with APR-246 to induce apoptosis in mutant-p53 tumours. We propose a new paradigm for targeting cancers that accumulate mutant-p53 protein by inhibiting the SLC7A11-glutathione axis.	0
A novel homozygous mutation at the GAA gene in Mexicans with early-onset Pompe disease. || Cardiomegaly Fatal Outcome Founder Effect Genetic Predisposition to Disease Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Homozygote Humans Infant Male Mexico Mutation Radiography alpha-Glucosidases || Glycogen-storage disease type II, also named Pompe disease, is caused by the deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, which originates lysosomal glycogen accumulation leading to progressive neuromuscular damage. Early-onset Pompe disease shows a debilitating and frequently fulminating course. To date, more than 300 mutations have been described; the majority of them are unique to each affected individual. Most early-onset phenotypes are associated with frameshift mutations leading to a truncated alpha-glucosidase protein with loss of function. Founder effects are responsible from many cases from few highprevalence world regions. Herein we described two apparently unrelated cases affected with classical early-onset Pompe disease, both pertaining to a small region from Central Mexico (the State of San Luis Potosí), the same novel homozygous frameshift mutation at gene GAA (c.1987delC) was demonstrated in both cases. This GAA gene deletion implies a change of glutamine to serine at codon 663, and a new reading frame that ends after 33 base pairs, which leads to the translation of a truncated protein. This report contributes to widen the knowledge on the effect of pathogenic mutations in Pompe disease. Here we postulate the existence of a founder effect.	1
First report of prevalence c.IVS1+1G>A and del (GJB6-13S1854) mutations in Syrian families with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. || Connexin 30 Connexins Exons Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Male Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Sequence Deletion Syria || Mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 genes are a frequent cause of congenital non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Mutational screening has usually focused on coding region of GJB2 gene. A few studies have been conducted on the non-coding region and exon 1. c.IVS1+1G>A (a splice site mutation in GJB2 gene have been detected as disruptive mutation. Del (GJB6 D13S1830) is found in many populations, but del (GJB6 D13S1854) is reported from a few restricted countries. This study was carried out to investigate the prevalence of splice site mutation c.IVS1+1G>A and two common deletions in GJB6 gene as the genetic etiology of hearing impairment in 70 Syrian families. The frequency of the c.IVS1+1G>A mutation and two deletions were determined by PCR-RFLP and A multiplex PCR assay. Our results showed a high prevalence of IVS1+1G>A mutation (20%) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) (15.7%) in deaf families. The homozygous genotype (c.IVS1+1G>A/c.IVS1+1G>A) was observed in one family and the compound heterozygous genotypes (c.35delG/c.IVS1+1G>A) and (c.IVS1+1G>A/V153I) were observed in 7 families and one family respectively. Also, the heterozygous state (c.IVS1+1G>A/unknown) was detected in 5 families. The study of del((GJB6-D13S1854) was showed a compound heterozygous genotype del((GJB6-D13S1854)/c.IVS1+1G>A) in the same families (5 families) having heterozygous genotype of c.IVS1+1G>A mutation. Also, del(GJB6-D13S1854) is combined with c.35delG mutation in 2 families and it was observed in the heterozygous state del(GJB6-D13S1854)/unknown) in 4 families. In contrast, the del(GJB6-D13S1830) described in many population was absent in our patients. Our findings indicate to significant contribution of the splice site mutation and del(GJB6-D13S1854) in our deaf families and these mutations were important causes of hearing impairment.	4
Towards Personalized Medicine in Melanoma: Implementation of a Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing Panel. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Line, Tumor Cost-Benefit Analysis Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Odds Ratio Precision Medicine Sensitivity and Specificity || Molecular diagnostics are increasingly performed routinely in the diagnosis and management of patients with melanoma due to the development of novel therapies that target specific genetic mutations. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has enabled to sequence multiple cancer-driving genes in a single assay, with improved sensitivity in mutation detection. The main objective of this study was the design and implementation of a melanoma-specific sequencing panel, and the identification of the spectrum of somatic mutations in a series of primary melanoma samples. A custom panel was designed to cover the coding regions of 35 melanoma-related genes. Panel average coverage was 2,575.5 reads per amplicon, with 92,8% of targeted bases covered ≥500×. Deep coverage enabled sensitive discovery of mutations in as low as 0.5% mutant allele frequency. Eighty-five percent (85/100) of the melanomas had at least one somatic mutation. The most prevalent mutated genes were BRAF (50%;50/199), NRAS (15%;15/100), PREX2 (14%;14/100), GRIN2A (13%;13/100), and ERBB4 (12%;12/100). Turn-around-time and costs for NGS-based analysis was reduced in comparison to conventional molecular approaches. The results of this study demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of a custom-designed targeted NGS panel, and suggest the implementation of targeted NGS into daily routine practice.	4
p53 hot-spot mutants increase tumor vascularization via ROS-mediated activation of the HIF1/VEGF-A pathway. || Aspartic Acid Genes, p53 HCT116 Cells Humans Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit Mutation Neoplasms Reactive Oxygen Species Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A || The function of p53 tumor suppressor is often altered in various human tumors predominantly through missense-mutations resulting in accumulation of mutant proteins. We revealed that expression of p53 proteins with amino-acid substitutions at codons 175 (R175H), 248 (R248W), and 273 (R273H), representing the hot-spots of mutations in various human tumors, increased the number of vessels in HCT116 human colon carcinoma xenografts and, as a result, accelerated their growth. Stimulation of tumor angiogenesis was connected with about 2-fold increase in intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidant N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAC) decreased vessels number in tumors formed by cells with inactivated p53 and inhibited their growth. Effect of ROS on angiogenesis in tumors expressing hot-spot p53 mutants was correlated with their ability to increase a content of HIF1 transcriptional factor responsible for up-regulation of VEGF-A mRNAs.	0
Effects of oncogenic mutations and DNA response elements on the binding of p53 to p53-binding protein 2 (53BP2). || Amino Acid Sequence Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Area Under Curve Binding Sites Binding, Competitive Calorimetry Carrier Proteins Cloning, Molecular DNA Escherichia coli Fluorescein Fluorescence Polarization Fluorescent Dyes Humans Mutation Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Response Elements Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ultracentrifugation bcl-2-Associated X Protein || The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated in human cancers. Upon activation it can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. ASPP2 can specifically stimulate the apoptotic function of p53 but not cell cycle arrest, but the mechanism of enhancing the activation of pro-apoptotic genes over cell cycle arrest genes remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the binding of 53BP2 (p53-binding protein 2, the C-terminal domain of ASPP2) to p53 core domain and various mutants using biophysical techniques. We found that several p53 core domain mutations (R181E, G245S, R249S, R273H) have different effects on the binding of DNA response elements and 53BP2. Further, we investigated the existence of a ternary complex consisting of 53BP2, p53, and DNA response elements to gain insight into the specific pro-apoptotic activation of p53. We found that binding of 53BP2 and DNA to p53 is mutually exclusive in the case of GADD45, p21, Bax, and PIG3. Both pro-apoptotic and non-apoptotic response elements were competed off p53 by 53BP2 with no indication of a ternary complex.	0
Mutant p53 reactivation by small molecules makes its way to the clinic. || Animals Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Small Molecule Libraries Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in many human tumors, including common types of cancer such as colon and ovarian cancer. This illustrates the key role of p53 as trigger of cell cycle arrest or cell death upon oncogenic stress. Most TP53 mutations are missense mutations that result in single amino acid substitutions in p53 and expression of high levels of dysfunctional p53 protein. Restoration of wild type p53 function in such tumor cells will induce robust cell death and allow efficient eradication of the tumor. Therapeutic targeting of mutant p53 in tumors is a rapidly developing field at the forefront of translational cancer research. Various approaches have led to the identification of small molecules that can rescue mutant p53. These include compounds that target specific p53 mutations, including PK083 and PK5174 (Y220C mutant p53) and NSC319726 (R175H mutant p53), as well as PRIMA-1 and its analog APR-246 that affect a wider range of mutant p53 proteins. APR-246 has been tested in a Phase I/II clinical trial with promising results.	0
A versatile platform to analyze low-affinity and transient protein-protein interactions in living cells in real time. || Cell Line, Tumor Genes, Reporter Humans Luciferases, Firefly Mutation, Missense Nuclear Proteins Protein Binding Protein Interaction Mapping Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Recombinases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play central roles in orchestrating biological processes. While some PPIs are stable, many important ones are transient and hard to detect with conventional approaches. We developed ReBiL, a recombinase enhanced bimolecular luciferase complementation platform, to enable detection of weak PPIs in living cells. ReBiL readily identified challenging transient interactions between an E3 ubiquitin ligase and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. ReBiL's ability to rapidly interrogate PPIs in diverse conditions revealed that some stapled α-helical peptides, a class of PPI antagonists, induce target-independent cytosolic leakage and cytotoxicity that is antagonized by serum. These results explain the requirement for serum-free conditions to detect stapled peptide activity, and define a required parameter to evaluate for peptide antagonist approaches. ReBiL's ability to expedite PPI analysis, assess target specificity and cell permeability, and reveal off-target effects of PPI modifiers should facilitate the development of effective, cell-permeable PPI therapeutics and the elaboration of diverse biological mechanisms.	0
Keratinocytic epidermal nevi are associated with mosaic RAS mutations. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Epidermis Female Genes, ras Humans Keratinocytes Male Mosaicism Mutation Nevus Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Skin Neoplasms Young Adult || Activating RAS mutations in the germline cause rare developmental disorders such as Costello syndrome. Somatic RAS mutations are found in approximately 30% of human cancers. Keratinocytic epidermal nevi (KEN) represent benign congenital skin lesions arranged along Blaschko's lines. A subgroup of KEN is caused by hotspot oncogenic FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations in mosaicism, but the majority lack these mutations. This study screened 72 KEN for activating mutations in RAS genes and other oncogenes. Activating RAS mutations were identified in 28/72 (39%) of KEN. HRAS was the most commonly affected oncogene (86%), with the HRAS p.G13R substitution representing a new hotspot mutation. These results indicate that activating RAS somatic mutations leading to mosaicism result in benign KEN of the skin. Given the prevalence of KEN, mosaic HRAS mutations appear to be more common in patients than germline ones. These findings identify KEN as a mosaic RASopathy and lend further support to the notion that genetic mosaicism is an important contributor to disease.	4
Induction of nonapoptotic cell death by activated Ras requires inverse regulation of Rac1 and Arf6. || ADP-Ribosylation Factors Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Death Cell Line, Tumor Down-Regulation Endocytosis Endosomes Enzyme Activation Glioblastoma HEK293 Cells Humans Osteosarcoma Vacuoles rac1 GTP-Binding Protein ras Proteins || Methuosis is a unique form of nonapoptotic cell death triggered by alterations in the trafficking of clathrin-independent endosomes, ultimately leading to extreme vacuolization and rupture of the cell. Methuosis can be induced in glioblastoma cells by expression of constitutively active Ras. This study identifies the small GTPases, Rac1 and Arf6, and the Arf6 GTPase-activating protein, GIT1, as key downstream components of the signaling pathway underlying Ras-induced methuosis. The extent to which graded expression of active H-Ras(G12V) triggers cytoplasmic vacuolization correlates with the amount of endogenous Rac1 in the active GTP state. Blocking Rac1 activation with the specific Rac inhibitor, EHT 1864, or coexpression of dominant-negative Rac1(T17N), prevents the accumulation of vacuoles induced by H-Ras(G12V). Coincident with Rac1 activation, H-Ras(G12V) causes a decrease in the amount of active Arf6, a GTPase that functions in the recycling of clathrin-independent endosomes. The effect of H-Ras(G12V) on Arf6 is blocked by EHT 1864, indicating that the decrease in Arf6-GTP is directly linked to the activation of Rac1. Constitutively active Rac1(G12V) interacts with GIT1 in immunoprecipitation assays. Ablation of GIT1 by short hairpin RNA prevents the decrease in active Arf6, inhibits vacuolization, and prevents loss of cell viability in cells expressing Rac1(G12V). Together, the results suggest that perturbations of endosome morphology associated with Ras-induced methuosis are due to downstream activation of Rac1 combined with reciprocal inactivation of Arf6. The latter seems to be mediated through Rac1 stimulation of GIT1. Further insights into this pathway could suggest opportunities for the induction of methuosis in cancers that are resistant to apoptotic cell death.	0
Macrocerebellum, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and gut malrotation in a child with a 16q24.1-q24.2 contiguous gene deletion. || FBXO31 JPH3 MAP1LC3B SLC7A5 deletion syndrome macrocerebellum || Macrocerebellum is a rare condition characterized by enlargement of the cerebellum with conservation of the overall shape and cytoarchitecture. Here, we report on a child with a distinctive constellation of clinical features including macrocerebellum, epilepsy, apparent intellectual disability, dysautonomia, gut malrotation, and poor gut motility. Oligonucleotide chromosome microarray analysis identified a 16q24.1-q24.2 deletion that included four OMIM genes (FBXO31, MAP1LC3B, JPH3, and SLC7A5). Review of prior studies describing individuals with similar or overlapping16q24.1-q24.2 deletions identified no other reports of macrocerebellum. These observations highlight a potential genetic cause of this rare disorder and raise the possibility that one or more gene(s) in the 16q24.1-q24.2 interval regulate cerebellar development.	4
Mutation R273H confers p53 a stimulating effect on the IGF-1R-AKT pathway via miR-30a suppression in breast cancer. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Down-Regulation Female Humans MicroRNAs Mutation Phosphorylation Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Receptor, IGF Type 1 Signal Transduction Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is the most highly mutated tumor suppressor in human malignancies. A wide array of p53 mutations has been revealed to play pivotal roles during cancer progression, which abolish anti-tumor functions of wild type p53 but also elicit tumorigenic effects by activating a diverse subset of downstream molecules. R273H mutation of p53 has been closely implicated in human cancer. Here we report miR-30a as a novel downstream target of p53 R273H mutant, which binds to the promoter region to repress miR-30a expression. Consequently, p53 R273H mutant enhances the migratory capabilities of tumor cells that are compromised by exogenous miR-30a over-expression. Our further investigation indicates that p53 R273H mutation unleashes the inhibition effect of miR-30a on IGF-1R expression, thus leading to elevated activation of IGF-1R-AKT signaling cascade in tumor cells.	0
Pleomorphic liposarcoma: clinical observations and molecular variables. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Female Genes, p53 Humans Liposarcoma Male Middle Aged Mutation PPAR gamma Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Tissue Array Analysis || Pleomorphic liposarcoma (PLS) is a rare high-grade sarcoma that has lipoblastic differentiation. In this study, the authors evaluated PLS natural history, patient outcomes, and commonly deregulated protein biomarkers. Medical records from patients (n = 155) who had PLS from 1993 to 2010 were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent prognosticators. A PLS tissue microarray (TMA) (n = 56 patient specimens) was constructed for immunohistochemical analysis of molecular markers, and p53 gene sequencing (exons 5-9) was conducted. The average patient age was 57 years, and the patients presented with primary disease (n = 102), recurrent disease (n = 16), and metastatic disease (n = 37). Lower extremity was the most common disease site (40%), and the average tumor size was 11 cm. Complete follow-up data were available for 83 patients, and their median follow-up was 22.6 months. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 53%; and recurrent disease, unresectability, and microscopic positive margins were identified as predictors of a poor prognosis. Systemic relapse (the strongest poor prognostic determinant) developed in 35% of patients with localized PLS. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (an adipogenic marker), B-cell leukemia 2 and survivin (survival factors), vascular endothelial growth factor (an angiogenic factor), matrix metalloproteinase 2, and other biomarkers. Frequent loss of retinoblastoma protein expression and high p53 mutation rates (approximately 60%) were observed. PLS is an aggressive, metastasizing sarcoma. Identifying ubiquitous molecular events underlying PLS progression is crucial for progress in patient management and outcomes.	4
The clinical features, outcomes and genetic characteristics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with severe right ventricular hypertrophy. || Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Echocardiography Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heart Ventricles Humans Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Treatment Outcome || Severe right ventricular hypertrophy (SRVH) is a rare phenotype in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) for which limited information is available. This study was undertaken to investigate the clinical, prognostic and genetic characteristics of HCM patients with SRVH. HCM with SRVH was defined as HCM with a maximum right ventricular wall thickness ≥10 mm. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in HCM patients with SRVH. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify risk factors for cardiac death and events in HCM with SRVH. Patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ApHCM) were selected as a comparison group. The clinical features and outcomes of 34 HCM patients with SRVH and 273 ApHCM patients were compared. Compared with the ApHCM group, the HCM with SRVH group included younger patients and a higher proportion of female patients and also displayed higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models identified 2 independent predictors of cardiovascular death in HCM patients with SRVH, a New York Heart Association class ≥III (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-52.87, p = 0.019) and an age at the time of HCM diagnosis ≤18 (HR = 5.5, 95% CI: 1.24-28.36, p = 0.026). Among the 11 HCM patients with SRVH who underwent WGS, 10 (90.9%) were identified as carriers of at least one specific sarcomere gene mutation. MYH7 and TTN mutations were the most common sarcomere mutations noted in this study. Two or more HCM-related gene mutations were observed in 9 (82%) patients, and mutations in either other cardiomyopathy-related genes or ion-channel disease-related genes were found in 8 (73%) patients. HCM patients with SRVH were characterized by poor clinical outcomes and the presentation of multiple gene mutations.	4
[Spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation in the patients with phenylketonuria in Beijing area of China]. || Alleles China Genetic Association Studies Genotype Humans Infant, Newborn Introns Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic || To identify the mutation spectrum and the distribution of minihaplotypes (STR/VNTR) of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and explore the correlations between genotype and phenotype of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Beijing area of China. (1) Fifty cases with PKU were involved in this study. PKU was identified by the Neonatal Screening Center of Beijing. All 13 exons and their flanking intronic sequences of PAH gene of these patients were amplified and then subjected to SSCP analysis and direct sequencing. (2) The distribution of polymorphic locus of short tandem repeat (STR) and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) was analyzed by PCR and denaturing gel electrophoresis. (3) The correlations between genotype and phenotype were studied by analysis of the matching rate between the expected and observed phenotypes. The predicted phenotype was determined on the basis of the sum of the assigned values of the two mutant alleles. (1) A total of 34 different mutations were detected with the relative frequency of 95% among 50 PKU patients. The prevalent mutations in this study were: R243Q (20%), EX6-96A > G (11%), Y356X (9%), and V399V (7%). The next common mutations were R111X (5%), R413P (5%), R252Q (3%) and A434D (3%). Thirty-four detected mutations were distributed throughout the whole PAH gene, except exon 1, 8 and 13. Exon 7 and 11, with the mutant rate 34% and 19% respectively, seemed to be the hot mutant areas/regions of PAH gene. (2) The minihaplotypes (STR/VNTR) of 34 mutations were identified in this research. The STR and VNTR showed 8 and 3 alleles, respectively. Among them, 244 bp (44%) and 240 bp (34%) were the prevalent STR alleles. Meanwhile, the VNTR3 (83%) was the most common VNTR allele in PKU patients. (3) A better consistency (81.5%) between expected and observed phenotypes was revealed by analysis of correlation between genotype and phenotype. Especially in classic PKU, the consistency rate was up to 87.5%. (1) The frequency distribution of common PAH gene mutations in Beijing region was close to that of Tianjin and Yunnan regions, while it was different from that of Southern regions of China, such as Guangzhou, especially Taiwan. The PAH mutation with a highly heterogeneous trait was also demonstrated in this study. (2) STR and VNTR minihaplotype will prove helpful to trace the origins of PAH mutations and to analyze the genetic drift. However, the most minihaplotypes of the STR/VNTR are similar, so it is necessary to associate some other polymorphic loci with the STR/VNTR minihaplotype to analyze the different mutations. (3) The fact that a better consistency existed between phenotypes and genotype with most PKU patients suggested that the study of the genotype of PKU patients would be helpful to the individualized treatment and to genetic counseling for their families.	3
Overexpression and genetic abnormality of p53 in parathyroid adenomas. || Adenoma Aged Base Sequence Cell Nucleus Exons Female Gene Deletion Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Humans Hyperparathyroidism Immunohistochemistry Loss of Heterozygosity Male Middle Aged Parathyroid Neoplasms Point Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || To study the significance of p53 abnormality in parathyroid tumors, 32 parathyroid adenomas and 22 hyperplastic glands from 14 cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism were analysed using immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemical study revealed p53 overexpression in four parathyroid adenomas, of which two showed diffuse and one showed focal nuclear pleomorphism. Genetic analysis disclosed allelic loss in one, and a point mutation (R290H) and a polymorphism (L257 L) in another of the two other adenomas with diffuse nuclear pleomorphism. No abnormalities were discovered in the other two adenomas, although one had a R72P polymorphism in exon 4. There was no evidence of malignancy of the four tumors in either clinical or pathological terms. None of the 22 hyperplastic glands showed p53 overexpression. These results demonstrate that p53 abnormality can occur in benign parathyroid adenomas and is more prevalent in those with nuclear pleomorphism than in those without.	4
Epidemiology of Moderate Alcohol Consumption and Breast Cancer: Association or Causation? ||  || Epidemiological studies have been used to show associations between modifiable lifestyle habits and the incidence of breast cancer. Among such factors, a history of alcohol use has been reported in multiple studies and meta-analyses over the past decades. However, associative epidemiological studies that were interpreted as evidence that even moderate alcohol consumption increases breast cancer incidence have been controversial. In this review, we consider the literature on the relationship between moderate or heavy alcohol use, both in possible biological mechanisms and in variations in susceptibility due to genetic or epigenetic factors. We argue that there is a need to incorporate additional approaches to move beyond the associations that are reported in traditional epidemiological analyses and incorporate information on molecular pathologic signatures as a requirement to posit causal inferences. In particular, we point to the efforts of the transdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) to evaluate possible causal relationships, if any, of alcohol consumption and breast cancer. A wider application of the principles of MPE to this field would constitute a giant step that could enhance our understanding of breast cancer and multiple modifiable risk factors, a step that would be particularly suited to the era of "personalized medicine".	4
Greater impact of melanocortin-4 receptor deficiency on rates of growth and risk of type 2 diabetes during childhood compared with adulthood in Pima Indians. || Adolescent Adult Body Mass Index Child Child Development Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Growth and Development Humans Indians, North American Male Middle Aged Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Risk Factors Young Adult || Features of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency have been observed to be more pronounced in childhood. Longitudinal data from a population-based study were used to separate the phenotypic effects of MC4R deficiency during childhood and adulthood. The MC4R exon was sequenced in 6,760 individuals of predominantly Pima Indian heritage, and discovered mutations were functionally assessed in vitro. Effects on BMI, height, and slope of BMI change were assessed during childhood (ages 5-20 years) and adulthood (ages 20-45 years). Six mutations affecting MC4R function, including three that may be private to Pima Indians, were found in 159 individuals (2.4%). The slope of BMI increase was greater in individuals carrying an MC4R mutation compared with noncarriers during childhood but not during adulthood. The final adult height obtained was higher in individuals with MC4R deficiency. There was an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes in individuals with a defective MC4R during childhood and adulthood, but this was only independent of BMI in childhood. The greater rates of body mass accumulation and risk of type 2 diabetes before the age of 20 years in individuals with MC4R deficiency indicate that the effects of these mutations are more apparent during the active growth of childhood.	4
[Identification of mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and exon 5 novel mutation Y166X(C-->G) in Yunnan]. ||  || To identify the mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in Yunnan so as to enhance the gene diagnosis of classical phenylketonuria (PKU) in that south-western province of China. Exons 4,5,6,7,10,11 and 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase(PAH) were analyzed in 13/14 children affected with classical PKU from Yunnan by using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP),PCR-ASO dot blot hybridization,allele specific polymerase chain reaction(ASPCR) and PCR-direct sequencing. Five missense mutations, i.e. R243Q. (5/26), Y204C(3/28), G247V(1/26),R413P(2/28) and T418P(1/28);three nonsense mutations,i.e. Y166X(C-->G)(2/26),W326X(1/28) and Y356X(2/26);and one silent mutation(V399V)(2/26) were identified. The nonsense mutation Y166X(C-->G) should be a novel mutation as compared with the PAH Mutation Database. Five kinds of popular PAH gene mutation (R243Q,Y204C,V399V,Y356X and R413P) identified in the people of Yunnan are similar to those in the northern people, but such characteristic is different from that in the southern people. This finding will enhance the efficacy in gene diagnosis of PKU and will be of reference value for studies of population and regional difference in the pattern of PAH mutation distribution.	3
Mutation screening in genes known to be responsible for Retinitis Pigmentosa in 98 Small Han Chinese Families. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group China Exome Female Genes, X-Linked Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Retinitis Pigmentosa Whole Exome Sequencing || Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is highly heterogeneous in both clinical and genetic fields. Accurate mutation screening is very beneficial in improving clinical diagnosis and gene-specific treatment of RP patients. The reason for the difficulties in genetic diagnosis of RP is that the ethnic-specific mutation databases that contain both clinical and genetic information are largely insufficient. In this study, we recruited 98 small Han Chinese families clinically diagnosed as RP, including of 22 dominant, 19 recessive, 52 sporadic, and five X-linked. We then used whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis to detect mutations in the genes known for RP in 101 samples from these 98 families. In total, we identified 57 potential pathogenic mutations in 40 of the 98 (41%) families in 22 known RP genes, including 45 novel mutations. We detected mutations in 13 of the 22 (59%) typical autosomal dominant families, 8 of the 19 (42%) typical autosomal recessive families, 16 of the 52 (31%) sporadic small families, and four of the five (80%) X-linked families. Our results extended the mutation spectrum of known RP genes in Han Chinese, thus making a contribution to RP gene diagnosis and the pathogenetic study of RP genes.	4
Connexin-26 mutations in sporadic and inherited sensorineural deafness. || Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Linkage Genotype Humans Italy Male Mutation Spain || Hearing impairment affects one infant in 1000 and 4% of people aged younger than 45 years. Congenital deafness is inherited or apparently sporadic. We have shown previously that DFNB1 on chromosome 13 is a major locus for recessive deafness in about 80% of Mediterranean families and that the connexin-26 gene gap junction protein beta2 (GJB2) is mutated in DFNB1 families. We investigated mutations in the GJB2 gene in familial and sporadic cases of deafness. We obtained DNA samples from 82 families from Italy and Spain with recessive non-syndromic deafness and from 54 unrelated participants with apparently sporadic congenital deafness. We analysed the coding region of the GJB2 gene for mutations. We also tested 280 unrelated people from the general populations of Italy and Spain for the frameshift mutation 35delG. 49% of participants with recessive deafness and 37% of sporadic cases had mutations in the GJB2 gene. The 35delG mutation accounted for 85% of GJB2 mutations, six other mutations accounted for 6% of alleles, and no changes in the coding region of GJB2 were detected in 9% of DFNB1 alleles. The carrier frequency of mutation 35delG among people from the general population was one in 31 (95% CI one in 19 to one in 87). Mutations in the GJB2 gene are a major cause of inherited and apparently sporadic congenital deafness. Mutation 35delG is the most common mutation for sensorineural deafness. Identification of 35delG and other mutations in the GJB2 gene should facilitate diagnosis and counselling for the most common genetic form of deafness.	4
miR-27a-3p suppresses tumor metastasis and VM by down-regulating VE-cadherin expression and inhibiting EMT: an essential role for Twist-1 in HCC. || 3' Untranslated Regions Animals Antigens, CD Biological Mimicry Blotting, Western Cadherins Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Line, Tumor Down-Regulation Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HEK293 Cells Hep G2 Cells Humans Liver Neoplasms Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Nude MicroRNAs Microscopy, Fluorescence Neoplasm Metastasis Neovascularization, Pathologic Nuclear Proteins Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Transplantation, Heterologous Twist-Related Protein 1 || Twist-1 and miRNAs have been reported to be associated with tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. However, the relationship between Twist-1 and miRNAs and the function of miRNAs remain largely undefined. We aimed to reveal the Twist-1-related miRNA expression profile and to determine whether Twist-1 functions in tumor metastasis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) by regulating miRNA expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Results showed that the expression of miR-27a-3p was consistently down-regulated in HCC cell lines and tissue samples displaying high expression of Twist-1. Both loss- and gain-of-function assays revealed suppressive effects of miR-27a-3p. Low miR-27a-3p expression was significantly associated with early metastasis in HCC. Subsequent investigations revealed that miR-27a-3p mediated the inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additional experiments showed that VE-cadherin is a direct target of miR-27a-3p and further demonstrated the critical role of miR-27a-3p in suppressing tumor metastasis and VM. Twist-1 up-regulation in HepG2 cells resulted in the differential expression of 18 miRNAs. Among them, miR-27a-3p deregulation contributed to VM and metastasis. The miR-27a-3p-mediated down-regulation of VE-cadherin and inhibition of EMT may be essential for Twist-1 to induce tumor metastasis and VM. Our findings highlight the importance of miR-27a-3p and suggest a promising new strategy for anti-HCC therapy.	0
A case report of successful diagnosis of a pulmonary nodule by a survey of oncogenic mutations; primary lung carcinoma or pulmonary metastasis? ||  || The number of patients diagnosed with solid carcinomas is increasing, and the most common site of metastasis is the lungs. It is often difficult to make a differential diagnosis between primary lung carcinoma and metastatic lung tumor in using histological examination and by determining their immunohistological status. A 64-years-old man presented with dyspnea with chest computed tomography (CT) findings of a pulmonary tumor, and afterwards suffered from a sudden bowel hemorrhaged due to colorectal carcinoma. The histological diagnosis of a pulmonary tumor was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Both Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and Cytokeratin20 (CK20) were immunohistologically negative. Of the some oncogenic mutations investigated, a neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogen homolog (NRAS) codon13 G13D mutation was detected in both the colorectal carcinoma and the pulmonary tumor tissue samples. Based on the result, the pulmonary tumor was diagnosed as a metastasis derived from colorectal carcinoma. Recently, examination of the oncogenes of solid carcinomas has been clinically investigated in primary lung caricnoma and in colorectal carcinomas. The clinical advantage of the oncogenic mutation survey is to identify the site, and the type, of amino acid change in detail. This case is a rare successful case of a survey of the oncogenes for giving a differential diagnosis. A survey of the oncogenic genes is very useful to make a differential diagnosis between primary lung carcinoma and metastatic lung tumor.	4
Mitochondrial localization and regulation of BRAFV600E in thyroid cancer: a clinically used RAF inhibitor is unable to block the mitochondrial activities of BRAFV600E. || Animals Apoptosis Benzenesulfonates Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cells, Cultured Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Fluorescent Antibody Technique Humans Mice Mice, Transgenic Mitochondria Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mutation Niacinamide Phenylurea Compounds Phosphorylation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Pyridines Sorafenib Subcellular Fractions Thyroid Gland Thyroid Neoplasms || The oncogenic BRAF(V600E) mutation results in an active structural conformation characterized by greatly elevated ERK activity. However, additional cellular effects caused by subcellular action of BRAF(V600E) remain to be identified. To explore these effects, differences in the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant BRAF in thyroid cancer were investigated. A significant proportion of endogenous and exogenous BRAF(V600E), but not wild-type BRAF, was detected in the mitochondrial fraction, similar to other BRAF mutants including BRAF(V600D), BRAF(V600K), BRAF(V600R), and BRAF(G469A), which showed elevated kinase activity and mitochondrial localization. Induced expression of BRAF(V600E) suppressed the apoptotic responses against staurosporine and TNFα/cycloheximide. Interestingly, the mitochondrial localization and antiapoptotic activities of BRAF(V600E) were unaffected by sorafenib and U0126 suppression of MAPK kinase (MEK) and ERK activities. Similarly, although the RAF inhibitor sorafenib effectively inhibited MEK/ERK activation, it did not block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E). In addition, inducible expression of BRAF(V600E) increased the glucose uptake rate and decreased O(2) consumption, suggesting that BRAF(V600E) reduces mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a signature feature of cancer cells. Again, these metabolic alterations resulted by BRAF(V600E) expression were not affected by the treatment of thyroid cells by sorafenib. Therefore, RAF and MEK inhibitors are unable to block the antiapoptotic activity of BRAF(V600E) or correct the high glucose uptake rate and glycolytic activity and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation induced by BRAF(V600E). The mitochondrial localization observed in oncogenic BRAF mutants might be related to their altered responses to apoptotic stimuli and characteristic metabolic phenotypes found in thyroid cancer. The inability of MEK and RAF inhibitors, U0126 and sorafenib, respectively, to block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E) has additional therapeutic implications for BRAF(V600E)-positive thyroid cancers.	0
Chronic low dose UV exposure and p53 mutation: tilting the odds in early epidermal preneoplasia? || Animals Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation Epidermis Humans Mutation Precancerous Conditions Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ultraviolet Rays || This review addresses how mutation of the TP53 gene (p53) and ultraviolet light alter the behavior of normal progenitor cells in early epidermal preneoplasia. Cancer is thought to evolve from single mutant cells, which expand into clones and ultimately into tumors. While the mutations in malignant lesions have been studied intensively, less is known about the earliest stages of preneoplasia, and how environmental factors may contribute to drive expansion of mutant cell clones. Here we review the evidence that ultraviolet radiation not only creates new mutations but drives the exponential growth of the numerous p53 mutant clones found in chronically exposed epidermis. Published data is reconciled with a new paradigm of epidermal homeostasis which gives insights into the behavior of mutant cells. We also consider the reasons why so few mutant cells progress into tumors and discuss the implications of these findings for cancer prevention.	0
Targeted next-generation sequencing of cancer genes dissects the molecular profiles of intraductal papillary neoplasms of the pancreas. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma, Papillary DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Middle Aged Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Mutation Neoplasm Grading Neoplasms, Cystic, Mucinous, and Serous Pancreatic Neoplasms Phenotype Retrospective Studies || Intraductal neoplasms are important precursors to invasive pancreatic cancer and provide an opportunity to detect and treat pancreatic neoplasia before an invasive carcinoma develops. The diagnostic evaluation of these lesions is challenging, as diagnostic imaging and cytological sampling do not provide accurate information on lesion classification, the grade of dysplasia or the presence of invasion. Moreover, the molecular driver gene mutations of these precursor lesions have yet to be fully characterized. Fifty-two intraductal papillary neoplasms, including 48 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and four intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasms (ITPNs), were subjected to the mutation assessment in 51 cancer-associated genes, using ion torrent semiconductor-based next-generation sequencing. P16 and Smad4 immunohistochemistry was performed on 34 IPMNs and 17 IPMN-associated carcinomas. At least one somatic mutation was observed in 46/48 (96%) IPMNs; 29 (60%) had multiple gene alterations. GNAS and/or KRAS mutations were found in 44/48 (92%) of IPMNs. GNAS was mutated in 38/48 (79%) IPMNs, KRAS in 24/48 (50%) and these mutations coexisted in 18/48 (37.5%) of IPMNs. RNF43 was the third most commonly mutated gene and was always associated with GNAS and/or KRAS mutations, as were virtually all the low-frequency mutations found in other genes. Mutations in TP53 and BRAF genes (10% and 6%) were only observed in high-grade IPMNs. P16 was lost in 7/34 IPMNs and 9/17 IPMN-associated carcinomas; Smad4 was lost in 1/34 IPMNs and 5/17 IPMN-associated carcinomas. In contrast to IPMNs, only one of four ITPNs had detectable driver gene (GNAS and NRAS) mutations. Deep sequencing DNA from seven cyst fluid aspirates identified 10 of the 13 mutations detected in their associated IPMN.

Prediction and visualization data for the interpretation of sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric DNA variants found in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ||  || Genomic technologies are redefining the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships and over the past decade, many bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict functional consequences of single nucleotide variants. This article presents the data from a comprehensive computational workflow adopted to assess the biomedical impact of the DNA variants resulting from the experimental study "Molecular analysis of sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric genes in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy" (Bottillo et al., 2016) [1]. Several different independently methods were employed to predict the functional consequences of alleles that result in amino acid substitutions, to study the effect of some DNA variants over the splicing process and to investigate the impact of a sequence variant with respect to the evolutionary conservation.	4
Thyroid hormones derivatives reduce proliferation and induce cell death and DNA damage in ovarian cancer. ||  || Ovarian cancer is a highly aggressive disease and novel treatments are required. Thyroid hormones binding to αvβ3 integrin produced growth-promoting activities in ovarian cancer and we hypothesized that natural thyroid hormone derivatives may antagonize these actions. The effect of three antagonists, tetraiodoacetic acid (tetrac), triiodothyroacetic acid (triac) and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), on cell proliferation, cell death and DNA damage was studied in two ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3 and A2780), normal hamster ovary control cells (CHOK1) and αvβ3-deficient or transfected HEK293 cells. A differential inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in ovarian cancer cells compared to CHOK1. In OVCAR3, an induction of cell cycle regulators was further shown. Apoptosis was confirmed (annexin-PI, SubG1/cell-cycle, apoptotic genes, caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage) and was reversed by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Induction in apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) was observed, suggesting a parallel caspase-independent mechanism. Integrin-involvement in triac/T1AM apoptotic action was shown in αvβ3-transfected HEK293 cells. Lastly, in ovarian cancer models, key proteins that coordinate recognition of DNA damage, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and PARP-1, were induced. To conclude, the cytotoxic potential of thyroid hormone derivatives, tetrac, triac and T1AM, in ovarian cancer may provide a much-needed novel therapeutic approach.	0
The study of pH-dependent stability shows that the TPLH-mediated hydrogen-bonding network is important for the conformation and stability of human gankyrin. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Humans Hydrogen Bonding Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Mice Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Protein Conformation Protein Stability Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Sequence Homology, Amino Acid || Ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins possess a distinctive modular and repetitive architecture, and their global folds are maintained by short-range interactions in terms of the primary sequence. In this work, we extended our previous study on the highly conserved TPLH tetrapeptide and investigated the impact of a solvent-exposed histidine residue on the pH-dependent stability of gankyrin, providing further insight into the contribution of the TPLH motif to the tertiary fold of AR proteins. Consisting of seven ARs, gankyrin has five histidine residues in TPLH motifs or its variants, all of which adopt a H(ε2)-tautermeric form and are shielded from solvent. By truncating the C-terminal ankyrin repeat (AR7), we exposed H177 in the (174)TPLH(177) of AR6 (the second C-terminal AR) to an aqueous environment. We showed that this truncated gankyrin mutant, namely, Gank(1-201), was well-folded at a neutral pH with a slightly lower stability with respect to gankyrin wild type (WT). However, unlike gankyrin WT, the stability of Gank(1-201) was markedly decreased together with a loss of conformation at a pH slightly below 6.0. It was rationalized that the protonation of the H177 imidazole ring triggered the disruption of the TPLH-mediated hydrogen-bonding network, which in turn led to the loss of conformation and stability. These results together with the work on Q210H mutant nicely explain that the C-terminal AR7 has a (207)TPLQ(210) variant and are in support of the notion that a string of TPLH/variant, which may arguably act like a zip lock to the elongated AR proteins via intra-/inter-repeat hydrogen-bonding, is important in maintaining the tertiary fold. Additionally, we made rational mutagenesis to introduce extra surface charge on AR7 of gankyrin and demonstrated that G214E and I219D mutations increased the stability of gankyrin while the function remained intact. Taken together, our results indicate that the TPLH-mediated hydrogen-bonding network is important for the conformation and stability of human gankyrin, and the C-terminal AR contributes to the conformational stability of gankyrin (AR proteins in general) through shielding this TPLH network from solvent as well as making the surface area more accessible to solvent.	0
Investigation and prediction of the severity of p53 mutants using parameters from structural calculations. || Algorithms Breast Neoplasms Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Female Humans Models, Molecular Mutation Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Protein Conformation Severity of Illness Index Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || A method has been developed to predict the effects of mutations in the p53 cancer suppressor gene. The new method uses novel parameters combined with previously established parameters. The most important parameter is the stability measure of the mutated structure calculated using molecular modelling. For each mutant, a severity score is reported, which can be used for classification into deleterious and nondeleterious. Both structural features and sequence properties are taken into account. The method has a prediction accuracy of 77% on all mutants and 88% on breast cancer mutations affecting WAF1 promoter binding. When compared with earlier methods, using the same dataset, our method clearly performs better. As a result of the severity score calculated for every mutant, valuable knowledge can be gained regarding p53, a protein that is believed to be involved in over 50% of all human cancers.	0

Unique spectrum of GJB2 mutations in Mexico. || Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Deafness Gene Deletion Gene Frequency Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Mexico Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic || The aim of this study was to elucidate the involvement of mutations in three relatively common deafness genes in Mexican individuals with non-syndromic hearing loss. We sequenced GJB2 for mutations, screened for two deletions involving GJB6, del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854), and for the m.1555A>G mutation in the MTRNR1 gene in 76 (71 simplex and 5 multiplex) unrelated Mexican probands with prelingual non-syndromic hearing loss. Samples were obtained from the Department of Genetics at Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitacion in Mexico City. Eight previously reported pathogenic variants and two polymorphic variants in GJB2 were identified. The two screened GJB6 deletions and the m.1555A>G mutation were not detected. Eight cases (10.6%) were found to have bi-allelic mutations in GJB2 and six (7.9%) were found to have a monoallelic GJB2 mutation. Of the six monoallelic mutations, one (p.R184Q) was a previously reported autosomal dominant variant. The most frequent pathological allele detected in this population was the c.35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene. The p.V27I polymorphic variant was also detected, with an allele frequency of 0.24. All eight probands with GJB2 mutations had symmetric profound deafness, whereas patients without GJB2 mutations had moderate, severe or profound hearing loss. This study shows that GJB2 mutations are an important cause of prelingual deafness in the Mexican population.	4
Recent Advances in the Molecular Genetics of Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in South Asian Descendants. ||  || The South Asian population, numbered at 1.8 billion, is estimated to comprise around 20% of the global population and 1% of the American population, and has one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease. While South Asians show increased classical risk factors for developing heart failure, the role of population-specific genetic risk factors has not yet been examined for this group. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the major cardiac genetic disorders among South Asians, leading to contractile dysfunction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. This disease displays autosomal dominant inheritance, and it is associated with a large number of variants in both sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric proteins. The South Asians, a population with large ethnic diversity, potentially carries region-specific polymorphisms. There is high variability in disease penetrance and phenotypic expression of variants associated with HCM. Thus, extensive studies are required to decipher pathogenicity and the physiological mechanisms of these variants, as well as the contribution of modifier genes and environmental factors to disease phenotypes. Conducting genotype-phenotype correlation studies will lead to improved understanding of HCM and, consequently, improved treatment options for this high-risk population. The objective of this review is to report the history of cardiovascular disease and HCM in South Asians, present previously published pathogenic variants, and introduce current efforts to study HCM using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, next-generation sequencing, and gene editing technologies. The authors ultimately hope that this review will stimulate further research, drive novel discoveries, and contribute to the development of personalized medicine with the aim of expanding therapeutic strategies for HCM.	4
Variants on the promoter region of PTEN affect breast cancer progression and patient survival. || Breast Neoplasms Cluster Analysis Disease Progression Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans PTEN Phosphohydrolase Polymorphism, Genetic Prognosis Promoter Regions, Genetic Survival Analysis || The PTEN gene, a regulator of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt oncogenic pathway, is mutated in various cancers and its expression has been associated with tumor progression in a dose-dependent fashion. We investigated the effect of germline variation in the promoter region of the PTEN gene on clinical characteristics and survival in breast cancer. We screened the promoter region of the PTEN gene for germline variation in 330 familial breast cancer cases and further determined the genotypes of three detected PTEN promoter polymorphisms -903GA, -975GC, and -1026CA in a total of 2,412 breast cancer patients to evaluate the effects of the variants on tumor characteristics and disease outcome. We compared the gene expression profiles in breast cancers of 10 variant carriers and 10 matched non-carriers and performed further survival analyses based on the differentially expressed genes. All three promoter variants associated with worse prognosis. The Cox's regression hazard ratio for 10-year breast cancer specific survival in multivariate analysis was 2.01 (95% CI 1.17 to 3.46) P = 0.0119, and for 5-year breast cancer death or distant metastasis free survival 1.79 (95% CI 1.03 to 3.11) P = 0.0381 for the variant carriers, indicating PTEN promoter variants as an independent prognostic factor. The breast tumors from the promoter variant carriers exhibited a similar gene expression signature of 160 differentially expressed genes compared to matched non-carrier tumors. The signature further stratified patients into two groups with different recurrence free survival in independent breast cancer gene expression data sets. Inherited variation in the PTEN promoter region affects the tumor progression and gene expression profile in breast cancer. Further studies are warranted to establish PTEN promoter variants as clinical markers for prognosis in breast cancer.	4
Pathogenic Mutations in Cancer-Predisposing Genes: A Survey of 300 Patients with Whole-Genome Sequencing and Lifetime Electronic Health Records. || Electronic Health Records Genes, Neoplasm Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome, Human Humans Mutation Neoplasms Sequence Analysis, DNA || It is unclear whether and how whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data can be used to implement genomic medicine. Our objective is to retrospectively evaluate whether WGS can facilitate improving prevention and care for patients with susceptibility to cancer syndromes. We analyzed genetic mutations in 60 autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition genes in 300 deceased patients with WGS data and nearly complete long-term (over 30 years) medical records. To infer biological insights from massive amounts of WGS data and comprehensive clinical data in a short period of time, we developed an in-house analysis pipeline within the SeqHBase software framework to quickly identify pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The clinical data of the patients who carried pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants were further reviewed to assess their clinical conditions using their lifetime EHRs. Among the 300 participants, 5 (1.7%) carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 5 cancer-predisposing genes: one in APC, BRCA1, BRCA2, NF1, and TP53 each. When assessing the clinical data, each of the 5 patients had one or more different types of cancers, fully consistent with their genetic profiles. Among these 5 patients, 2 died due to cancer while the others had multiple disorders later in their lifetimes; however, they may have benefited from early diagnosis and treatment for healthier lives, had the patients had genetic testing in their earlier lifetimes. We demonstrated a case study where the discovery of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations from population-wide WGS correlates with clinical outcome. The use of WGS may have clinical impacts to improve healthcare delivery.	4
Rapid detection of the R408W and I65T mutations in phenylketonuria by glycosylase mediated polymorphism detection. ||  || Mutation detection methods based upon chemical or enzymatic cleavage of DNA offer excellent detection efficiencies coupled with high throughput and low unit cost. We describe the application of the novel technique of Glycosylase Mediated Polymorphism Detection (GMPD) to the detection of two of the most common mutations of the PAH gene in the Irish population that cause phenylketonuria (PKU), R408W and I65T, which occur at relative frequencies of 41.0% and 10.4% respectively. GMPD assays for R408W and I65T were developed permitting fluorescent detection of cleavage products on the ALFexpresstrade mark automated DNA sequencer. The method was validated by screening a panel of PKU patients whose mutant genotypes had previously been characterised by standard methods. It also proved possible to perform multiplex detection of the two mutations by co-electrophoresis of GMPD products. GMPD is a rapid and robust method for the detection of the R408W and I65T mutations, whose key advantage lies in its use of a pair of enzymes with high cleavage efficiency to detect a number of mutations as compared to the use of individual digestions with a range of specific restriction endonuclease enzymes.

Phenotypic variability of patients homozygous for the GJB2 mutation 35delG cannot be explained by the influence of one major modifier gene. || Connexin 26 Connexins Genetic Variation Genome-Wide Association Study Hearing Loss Homozygote Humans Mutation Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || Hereditary hearing loss (HL) is a very heterogeneous trait, with 46 gene identifications for non-syndromic HL. Mutations in GJB2 cause up to half of all cases of severe-to-profound congenital autosomal recessive non-syndromic HL, with 35delG being the most frequent mutation in Caucasians. Although a genotype-phenotype correlation has been established for most GJB2 genotypes, the HL of 35delG homozygous patients is mild to profound. We hypothesise that this phenotypic variability is at least partly caused by the influence of modifier genes. By performing a whole-genome association (WGA) study on 35delG homozygotes, we sought to identify modifier genes. The association study was performed by comparing the genotypes of mild/moderate cases and profound cases. The first analysis included a pooling-based WGA study of a first set of 255 samples by using both the Illumina 550K and Affymetrix 500K chips. This analysis resulted in a ranking of all analysed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) according to their P-values. The top 250 most significantly associated SNPs were genotyped individually in the same sample set. All 192 SNPs that still had significant P-values were genotyped in a second independent set of 297 samples for replication. The significant P-values were replicated in nine SNPs, with combined P-values between 3 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-4). This study suggests that the phenotypic variability in 35delG homozygous patients cannot be explained by the effect of one major modifier gene. Significantly associated SNPs may reflect a small modifying effect on the phenotype. Increasing the power of the study will be of greatest importance to confirm these results.	1

Repression of Wnt/β-catenin response elements by p63 (TP63). || Base Sequence Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors Binding Sites Catenins Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Silencing Humans Matrix Metalloproteinase 7 Protein Phosphatase 2 Response Elements Transcription Factor 4 Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins Wnt Proteins Wnt Signaling Pathway || Submitted: TP63 (p63), a member of the tumor suppressor TP53 (p53) gene family, is expressed in keratinocyte stem cells and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas to maintain cellular potential for growth and differentiation. Controversially, activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by p63 (Patturajan M. et al., 2002, Cancer Cells) and inhibition of the target gene expression (Drewelus I. et al., 2010, Cell Cycle) have been reported. Upon p63 RNA-silencing in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines, a few Wnt target gene expression substantially increased, while several target genes moderately decreased. Although ΔNp63α, the most abundant isoform of p63, appeared to interact with protein phosphatase PP2A, neither GSK-3β phosphorylation nor β-catenin nuclear localization was altered by the loss of p63. As reported earlier, ΔNp63α enhanced β-catenin-dependent luc gene expression from pGL3-OT having 3 artificial Wnt response elements (WREs). However, this activation was detectable only in HEK293 cells examined so far, and involved a p53 family-related sequence 5' to the WREs. In Wnt3-expressing SAOS-2 cells, ΔNp63α rather strongly inhibited transcription of pGL3-OT. Importantly, ΔNp63α repressed WREs isolated from the regulatory regions of MMP7. ΔNp63α-TCF4 association occurred in their soluble forms in the nucleus. Furthermore, p63 and TCF4 coexisted at a WRE of MMP7 on the chromatin, where β-catenin recruitment was attenuated. The combined results indicate that ΔNp63α serves as a repressor that regulates β-catenin-mediated gene expression.	0
[Homozygous and compound heterozygous RYR1 mutations. New findings on prevalence and penetrance of malignant hyperthermia]. || Adolescent Adult Aged Alleles Child DNA Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Malignant Hyperthermia Middle Aged Mutation Penetrance Prevalence Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel Young Adult || Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a life-threatening, acute pharmacogenetic disorder mostly due to heterozygous mutations in the ryanodin receptor 1 (RYR1) gene. Diagnosis is generally confirmed by the in vitro contracture test (IVCT). In this study the genotype-phenotype correlation was analyzed and the presumed prevalence of MH is discussed. After the diagnosis of MH susceptibility by the IVCT DNA samples of 44 patients were analyzed for mutations in the RYR1 gene using the polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. For genotype-phenotype correlation, the mutation analysis data were compared with the IVCT data. Out of the 44 patients tested 13 were identified with a heterozygous mutation, 1 patient with a homozygous mutation (c.1840C>T) and 1 patient with compound heterozygous mutations (c.1840C>T and c.6487C>T). The two patients with two mutated alleles showed a stronger response in the IVCT compared to those with only one mutated allele. Patients with one RYR1 mutation displayed significantly higher contractures in the IVCT than patients without RYR1 mutations. In the two patients described the presence of two mutated RYR1 alleles seemed to have an additive effect on the functional restriction of the (RYR1 receptor and to lead to a stronger response both in the IVCT and with regard to clinical signs. The patients with no detected RYR1 mutations possibly have a RYR1 mutation with smaller effects outside the hot spot regions tested and/or false positive IVCT results. The data from a small patient group indicate a substantially higher prevalence of MH with a correspondingly lower penetrance in the German population than previously assumed.	4
High-throughput sequencing screen reveals novel, transforming RAS mutations in myeloid leukemia patients. || Animals Bone Marrow Cells Cell Line Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Fibroblasts Genetic Testing Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Point Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction || Transforming mutations in NRAS and KRAS are thought to play a causative role in the development of numerous cancers, including myeloid malignancies. Although mutations at amino acids 12, 13, or 61 account for the majority of oncogenic Ras variants, we hypothesized that less frequent mutations at alternate residues may account for disease in some patients with cancer of unexplained genetic etiology. To search for additional, novel RAS mutations, we sequenced all coding exons in NRAS, KRAS, and HRAS in 329 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 32 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients, and 96 healthy individuals. We detected 4 "noncanonical" point mutations in 7 patients: N-Ras(G60E), K-Ras(V14I), K-Ras(T74P), and K-Ras(A146T). All 4 Ras mutants exhibited oncogenic properties in comparison with wild-type Ras in biochemical and functional assays. The presence of transforming RAS mutations outside of positions 12, 13, and 61 reveals that alternate mechanisms of transformation by RAS may be overlooked in screens designed to detect only the most common RAS mutations. Our results suggest that RAS mutations may play a greater role in leukemogenesis than currently believed and indicate that high-throughput screening for mutant RAS alleles in cancer should include analysis of the entire RAS coding region.	0
Searching for the relationship between the parameters of metabolic syndrome and the rs17782313 (T>C) polymorphism of the MC4R gene in postmenopausal women. || Aged Body Mass Index Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Logistic Models Metabolic Syndrome Middle Aged Odds Ratio Poland Polymorphism, Genetic Postmenopause Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 || Metabolic syndrome (MS) is widespread in the human population, and its incidence is continuously increasing, generating serious health problems. The purpose of this study was to find the relationship between the parameters of MS and the melanocortin type 4 receptor (MC4R) gene polymorphism in postmenopausal women. The study involved 344 healthy Polish women, who had their last menstrual cycle 1 year ago or earlier. The study included blood analysis, survey, and body measurements. The mean age was 58.5±6.6 years. An increased body mass index was observed in 65.7% and abdominal obesity in 80.3% of the study population. MS was diagnosed in 40.7% of all participants, including 39.3% of women with the T/T genotype and 44.7% of those with the C/X genotype (χ2 test;P>0.05). A logistic regression model showed that the probability of MS was higher in patients with the C/X genotype (odds ratio =1.25) (χ2 test;P>0.05). The study concluded that MS is a very common condition among postmenopausal women. The C/X genotype of theMC4R gene seems to predispose postmenopausal women to developing some MS symptoms.	4
Connexin 26 gene mutations in non-syndromic hearing loss among Kuwaiti patients. || Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Consanguinity Cross-Sectional Studies Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Infant Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction || To study connexin 26 (Cx26) gene mutations among autosomal recessive non-syndromal hearing loss in Kuwaiti patients and evaluate their effect on phenotypes. This cross sectional study included 100 patients aged between 6 months and 18 years, who were referred to the Sheikh Salem Al-Ali Centre for audiology and speech evaluation of autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss confirmed by clinico-genetic evaluation and a battery of diagnostic tests. Gene profiling and sequencing were performed to detect the presence and nature of Cx26 mutation. Of the 100 patients, mutation of Cx26 gene was detected in 15 patients (15%) of which 9 (60%) cases were heterozygous and 6 cases (40%) were homozygous. Eighty per cent of the 15 Cx26 positive cases resulted from the 35delG mutation. Among the heterozygous cases, 6 (66.6%) were positive for 35delG. All 6 homozygous patients were positive for the 35delG mutation. A significant correlation was found between genetic findings (p = 0.013) and family history (p = 0.029), as well as the onset (p = 0.015), course (p = 0.033), degree and configuration of hearing loss (p = 0.001). Among the selected Kuwaiti population sample, the Cx26 gene mutation was responsible for 15% of autosomal recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. We recommend that screening for Cx26 gene mutation be considered in the screening strategy of patients with non-syndromic childhood hearing loss for counselling and management purposes. .	4
SP600125 has a remarkable anticancer potential against undifferentiated thyroid cancer through selective action on ROCK and p53 pathways. || Anthracenes Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Histone Deacetylase 6 Histone Deacetylases Humans Protein Kinase Inhibitors Signal Transduction Thyroid Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 rho-Associated Kinases || Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide.The majority of thyroid cancer cases are well differentiated with favorable outcome. However, undifferentiated thyroid cancers are one of the most lethal human malignancies because of their invasiveness, metastatization and refractoriness even to the most recently developed therapies.In this study we show for the first time a significant hyperactivation of ROCK/HDAC6 pathway in thyroid cancer tissues, and its negative correlation with p53 DNA binding ability.We demonstrate that a small compound, SP600125 (SP), is able to induce cell death selectively in undifferentiated thyroid cancer cell lines by specifically acting on the pathogenic pathways of cancer development. In detail, SP acts on the ROCK/HDAC6 pathway involved in dedifferentiation and invasiveness of undifferentiated human cancers, by restoring its physiological activity level. As main consequence, cancer cell migration is inhibited and, at the same time, cell death is induced through the mitotic catastrophe. Moreover, SP exerts a preferential action on the mutant p53 by increasing its DNA binding ability. In TP53-mutant cells that survive mitotic catastrophe this process results in p21 induction and eventually lead to premature senescence. In conclusion, SP has been proved to be able to simultaneously block cell replication and migration, the two main processes involved in cancer development and dissemination, making it an ideal candidate for developing new drugs against anaplastic thyroid cancer.	0
Variation in PCSK9, low LDL cholesterol, and risk of peripheral arterial disease. || Cholesterol, LDL Cohort Studies Ethnic Groups Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Humans Male Middle Aged Peripheral Vascular Diseases Prevalence Proportional Hazards Models Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Risk Risk Factors Serine Endopeptidases || We hypothesized that variants in PCSK9 that lower LDL cholesterol levels are associated with reduced prevalence and incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study assessed risk factors and PCSK9 variants Y142X and C679X (relevant to blacks) and R46L (relevant to whites) in a cohort of 45-64-year olds in 1987-1989 (n=13,634). Prevalent PAD (n=619 cases) was defined by an ankle-brachial index <0.9 or a history of leg claudication. Incident PAD (n=895) was identified from 1987 to 1998 by the same PAD criteria or a PAD hospitalization. As expected, greater LDL cholesterol was a risk factor for prevalent and incident PAD. 2.4% of blacks and 3.1% of whites were carriers of one of the race-specific PCSK9 variants. Carriers had lower prevalence of PAD compared with non-carriers (2.3% vs. 4.6%). The corresponding age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of PAD was 0.47 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.92). In contrast with the cross-sectional findings, there was no association between PCSK9 variants and incident PAD (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.57)). Our study provides mixed evidence that variation in PCSK9 may contribute to genetic risk of PAD.	4
Clinical characteristics of patients with unicoronal synostosis and mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3: a preliminary report. ||  || Clinical teaching dictates that isolated unicoronal synostosis is sporadic in occurrence and is possibly related to intrauterine constraint. Despite this, isolated reports document a familial occurrence. It has previously been recognized that there may be a familial pattern of inheritance. Recently, mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) have been implicated in several syndromic craniosynostoses. At the authors' institution, mutations in FGFR3, located at chromosome 4p16, have been found to cause coronal synostosis. Two cases of unicoronal synostosis were found to have the same Pro250Arg missense mutation in FGFR3. This finding suggested that all patients with a diagnosis of unicoronal synostosis be screened for the FGFR3 mutation. Between January and December of 1996, patients with a diagnosis of plagiocephaly at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were evaluated for the FGFR3 mutation. Thirty-seven patients with unicoronal synostosis had mutational studies. Two additional patients were known to have the FGFR3 mutation at the onset of the study. Of the 37 patients screened, four were found to have the FGFR3 mutation, for a total of six patients with both unicoronal synostosis and the FGFR3 mutation. All patients with unicoronal synostosis were evaluated for facial dysmorphology and operative outcome. The six patients with the FGFR3 mutation had more severe cranial dysmorphology and were more likely to need surgical revision than those without the FGFR3 mutation. The occurrence of the FGFR3 mutation among patients with unicoronal synostosis provides evidence for a genetic basis of certain forms of plagiocephaly. The clinical, radiologic, and molecular findings will be an important addition to the surgical management and counseling of patients with unicoronal synostosis.	4
Hepatoblastoma and heart transplantation in a patient with cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. || Abnormalities, Multiple Child, Preschool Face Fatal Outcome Heart Defects, Congenital Heart Transplantation Hepatoblastoma Humans Liver Neoplasms MAP Kinase Kinase 1 Male Mutation Skin Abnormalities Syndrome || Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFC) and Costello syndrome (CS) are disorders with an overlapping spectrum of congenital anomalies. Mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway have recently been reported in both of these syndromes, with HRAS mutations characteristic for CS and BRAF and MEK1/2 mutations for CFC. We report on a 3-year-old boy who underwent a cardiac transplant at age 8 months for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; he was subsequently suspected to have CS. At age 35 months he presented with an intra-cardiac mass that was diagnosed as metastatic hepatoblastoma. Although hepatoblastoma is not known to have an increased frequency in immunocompromised patients, questions were raised as whether the post-transplant immuno-suppressive therapy played a role in tumor development. The patient died shortly thereafter and his post-mortem DNA analysis revealed a MEK1 mutation (Y130C) previously reported in CFC. While CS is associated with increased cancer risk, only a single case of leukemia has been reported in a patient with CFC, making this the first case of a solid tumor reported in a patient with CFC.	4

Probing CRLs in prostate cancer cells revealed a remarkable plasticity of cells with TMPRSS2-ERG translocation. CRL suppression by chemical inhibition or knockdown of RING component RBX1 led to reversible G0/G1 cell cycle arrest that prevented cell apoptosis. Conversely, complete blocking of CRLs at a higher inhibitor dose-induced cytotoxicity that was amplified by knockdown of CRL regulator Cand1. We analyzed cell signaling to understand how varying degrees of CRL inhibition translated to distinct cell fates. Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic cell signaling pathways and transcriptional activities were affected, with pro-metastatic Wnt/β-catenin as the most upregulated. Suppression of the NF-κB pathway contributed to anti-apoptotic effect, and androgen receptor (AR) and ERG played decisive, though opposite, roles: AR was involved in protective quiescence, whereas ERG promoted apoptosis. These data define AR-ERG interaction as a key plasticity and survival determinant in prostate cancer and suggest supplementary treatments that may overcome drug resistance mechanisms regulated by AR-ERG interaction.	0
Molecular study in Brazilian cochlear implant recipients. || Brazil Cochlear Implantation Cochlear Implants Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Hearing Loss Humans Mutation || The most common form of non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (NSRD) is caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene. Recently, a deletion truncating the GJB6 gene, called del(GJB6-D13S1,830) has also been described normally accompanying mutations in another allele of the GJB2 gene. Among all the mutations described to date, 35delG in the GJB2 gene is the most common. Preliminary data suggest that pathologic changes due to GJB2 mutations do not affect the spiral ganglion cells, which are the site of stimulation of the cochlear implant. Besides, the survival of the spiral ganglion cells is believed to be an important determinant of the outcome after surgery. Therefore, we have studied 49 non-syndromic deaf patients with unknown etiologies in order to determine the prevalence of GJB2 and GJB6 gene mutations in patients undergoing cochlear implantation surgery. Also, the molecular studies were performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing. As a result, we found 19 individuals with GJB2 mutation including one new mutation (K168R), one patient homozygous for the del(GJB6-D13S1,830). These results establish that genetic screening can provide an etiologic diagnosis, and may help with prognosis after cochlear implantation, as has been hypothesized in previous studies.	4
Novel oncogene amplifications in tumors from a family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. || Child Choroid Plexus Neoplasms Comparative Genomic Hybridization Female Gene Amplification Gene Dosage Germ-Line Mutation Humans Immunohistochemistry In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Loss of Heterozygosity Male Medulloblastoma Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Pedigree Rhabdoid Tumor Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) represents an inherited tumor syndrome that is typically caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene TP53. TP53 dysfunction secondarily disturbs the genetic integrity of the cell. Here, we report a family with LFS harboring a germline TP53 mutation (R248W) located in the functional domain of the protein that binds to the minor groove of the DNA. In this family, tumors of the central nervous system were diagnosed as primary malignancies in all carriers of the mutation. The index patient developed an anaplastic medulloblastoma with unusual genomic profile exhibiting six distinct high-level genomic amplifications, two of them targeting the MYCN and GLI2 genes, respectively. In an extrarenal rhabdoid tumor from the same patient, we found a novel high-level amplification of the MYC oncogene. The father of this patient was diagnosed with myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO degrees I), whereas a brother died from an early relapse of a choroid plexus carcinoma. The analysis of this LFS familiy thus revealed novel oncogene amplifications as different second hits that are likely to also play a role in the pathogenesis of their sporadic counterparts.	4
Electronic health record phenotype in subjects with genetic variants associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: a study of 30,716 subjects with exome sequencing. || Adult Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia Cohort Studies Electronic Health Records Exome Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Variation Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged Phenotype Prevalence Sequence Analysis, DNA || PurposeArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart disease. Clinical follow-up of incidental findings in ARVC-associated genes is recommended. We aimed to determine the prevalence of disease thus ascertained.MethodsIndividuals (n = 30,716) underwent exome sequencing. Variants in PKP2, DSG2, DSC2, DSP, JUP, TMEM43, or TGFβ3 that were database-listed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic were identified and evidence-reviewed. For subjects with putative loss-of-function (pLOF) variants or variants of uncertain significance (VUS), electronic health records (EHR) were reviewed for ARVC diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes.ResultsEighteen subjects had pLOF variants; none of these had an EHR diagnosis of ARVC. Of 14 patients with an electrocardiogram, one had a minor diagnostic criterion; the rest were normal. A total of 184 subjects had VUS, none of whom had an ARVC diagnosis. The proportion of subjects with VUS with major (4%) or minor (13%) electrocardiogram diagnostic criteria did not differ from that of variant-negative controls. ICD-9 codes showed no difference in defibrillator use, electrophysiologic abnormalities or nonischemic cardiomyopathies in patients with pLOF or VUSs compared with controls.ConclusionpLOF variants in an unselected cohort were not associated with ARVC phenotypes based on EHR review. The negative predictive value of EHR review remains uncertain.	4

Increased in vivo amyloid-β42 production, exchange, and loss in presenilin mutation carriers. || Adult Alzheimer Disease Amyloid Amyloid beta-Peptides Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Positron-Emission Tomography Presenilins || Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hypothesized to be caused by an overproduction or reduced clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) caused by mutations in the presenilin (PSEN) gene have been postulated to result from increased production of Aβ42 compared to Aβ40 in the central nervous system (CNS). This has been demonstrated in rodent models of ADAD but not in human mutation carriers. We used compartmental modeling of stable isotope labeling kinetic (SILK) studies in human carriers of PSEN mutations and related noncarriers to evaluate the pathophysiological effects of PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations on the production and turnover of Aβ isoforms. We compared these findings by mutation status and amount of fibrillar amyloid deposition as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using the amyloid tracer Pittsburgh compound B (PIB). CNS Aβ42 to Aβ40 production rates were 24% higher in mutation carriers compared to noncarriers, and this was independent of fibrillar amyloid deposits quantified by PET PIB imaging. The fractional turnover rate of soluble Aβ42 relative to Aβ40 was 65% faster in mutation carriers and correlated with amyloid deposition, consistent with increased deposition of Aβ42 into plaques, leading to reduced recovery of Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Reversible exchange of Aβ42 peptides with preexisting unlabeled peptide was observed in the presence of plaques. These findings support the hypothesis that Aβ42 is overproduced in the CNS of humans with PSEN mutations that cause AD, and demonstrate that soluble Aβ42 turnover and exchange processes are altered in the presence of amyloid plaques, causing a reduction in Aβ42 concentrations in the CSF.	4
Divergent effects of central melanocortin signalling on fat and sucrose preference in humans. || Body Weight Dietary Fats Dietary Sugars Eating Feeding Behavior Food Preferences Humans Melanocortins Neurons Obesity Point Mutation Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Signal Transduction Sucrose || Melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R)-expressing neurons modulate food intake and preference in rodents but their role in human food preference is unknown. Here we show that compared with lean and weight-matched controls, MC4R deficient individuals exhibited a markedly increased preference for high fat, but a significantly reduced preference for high sucrose food. These effects mirror those in Mc4r null rodents and provide evidence for a central molecular circuit influencing human macronutrient preference.	4
CREBBP knockdown enhances RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling in Ras pathway mutated acute lymphoblastic leukemia but does not modulate chemotherapeutic response. || Acetylation Animals Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols CREB-Binding Protein Cell Line, Tumor Disease Models, Animal Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic Gene Knockdown Techniques Histones Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Mice Mice, Knockout Mutation Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Receptors, Glucocorticoid Substrate Specificity Treatment Outcome ras Proteins || Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in young people and new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcome. Recent studies have shown that heterozygous inactivating mutations in the histone acetyl transferase, CREBBP, are particularly frequent in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and associated with a hyperdiploid karyotype andKRAS mutations. To study the functional impact ofCREBBP haploinsufficiency in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, RNA interference was used to knock down expression of CREBBP in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and various primagraft acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We demonstrate that attenuation of CREBBP results in reduced acetylation of histone 3 lysine 18, but has no significant impact on cAMP-dependent target gene expression. Impaired induction of glucocorticoid receptor targets was only seen in 1 of 4 CREBBP knockdown models, and there was no significant difference in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, sensitivity to other acute lymphoblastic leukemia chemotherapeutics or histone deacetylase inhibitors. Importantly, we show that CREBBP directly acetylates KRAS and that CREBBP knockdown enhances signaling of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in Ras pathway mutated acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, which are still sensitive to MEK inhibitors. Thus, CREBBP mutations might assist in enhancing oncogenic RAS signaling in acute lymphoblastic leukemia but do not alter response to MEK inhibitors.	0
Effects of currently prescribed LDL-C-lowering drugs on PCSK9 and implications for the next generation of LDL-C-lowering agents. || Animals Anticholesteremic Agents Azetidines Cholesterol, LDL Ezetimibe Fenofibrate Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Hypercholesterolemia Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Serine Endopeptidases || During the past decade, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been identified as a key regulator of serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. PCSK9 is secreted by the liver into the plasma and binds the hepatic LDL receptor, causing its subsequent degradation. In humans, gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause a form of familial hypercholesterolemia that manifests with dramatically increased serum levels of LDL-C, while loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with significantly decreased LDL-C and cardiovascular risk. Initial studies in animals and cultured cells demonstrated that statins increased PCSK9 mRNA expression, resulting in many research groups exploring the effect of statins on PCSK9 levels in humans. We first reported that statins increased human PCSK9 circulating protein levels. Additional researchers subsequently confirmed these observations, further prompting many laboratories including our own to examine the effect of other lipid lowering medications on PCSK9 levels. Our observation that fenofibrate (200 mg/day) significantly increased PCSK9 levels was confirmed by another laboratory, and an additional group demonstrated that ezetimibe also increased PCSK9 levels. It has become clear that the major classes of commonly prescribed lipid-lowering medications increase serum PCSK9 levels. These observations almost certainly explain why these agents are not more effective in lowering LDL-C and suggest that efforts should be made toward the development of new LDL-C lowering medications that either do not increase circulating PCSK9 levels or work through decreasing or inhibiting PCSK9.	4
[Mutation analysis of the PAH gene in patients with phenylketonuria in Gansu province]. || Adult Base Sequence China Exons Female Humans Infant Introns Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || To characterize the mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in patients with phenylketonuria in Gansu province. Mutations of the PAH gene were detected in exons 3, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 with flaking introns of PAH gene by PCR and DNA sequencing. Mutations were identified in 45/58 alleles (detection rate: 96.4%), in total of 18 variants. Among them IVS12+5G>C was a novel mutation. The most frequent mutations were R243Q (22.7%), V399V (12.1%), EX6-96A>G (5.2%), R413P (5.2%) and IVS4-1G>A (5.2%), followed by Y356X (3.4%), R111X (3.4%) and INS7+2T>A (3.4%). The mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in patients with phenylketonuria in Gansu province were similar to that in other areas of China, with obvious difference in mutation rate of some mutations.	3
High incidence of GJB2 mutations during screening of newborns for hearing loss in Austria. || Austria Connexin 26 Connexins Female Hearing Disorders Humans Incidence Infant, Newborn Male Mass Screening Neonatal Screening Point Mutation || The aim of the present study was to evaluate gap junction protein beta2 (GJB2) genetic testing within a national neonate screening program for hearing loss (HL) in a European population. Neonatal cases of nonsyndromic HL (N = 21) were identified by postpartal otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and brain stem electric response audiometry (BERA) analysis. GJB2 testing was performed by direct sequencing. Mutations in GJB2 were found in 15 of 21 children (71.4%) identified by neonatal audiological screening. The 35delG mutation in GJB2 was found homozygous in 10 cases (47.6%) and also as a clear cause of HL as the heterozygous alterations 35delG/del311-324 and 35delG/L90P. In a single case, L90P/R143Q was also identified as a cause of HL. In 3 HL cases that were not identifiable during initial OAE testing, homozygous 35delG and 35delG/R184P defined the genetic basis for HL in 2 cases, whereas one case had wild-type GJB2. Our findings of the high mutation rate in the Austrian population, especially in neonates identified during the newborn screening program, confirm the importance of screening for mutations in GJB2.	4
Drug-screening and genomic analyses of HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines reveal predictors for treatment response. ||  || Approximately 15%-20% of all diagnosed breast cancers are characterized by amplified and overexpressed HER2 (= ErbB2). These breast cancers are aggressive and have a poor prognosis. Although improvements in treatment have been achieved after the introduction of trastuzumab and lapatinib, many patients do not benefit from these drugs. Therefore, in-depth understanding of the mechanisms behind the treatment responses is essential to find alternative therapeutic strategies. Thirteen HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines were screened with 22 commercially available compounds, mainly targeting proteins in the ErbB2-signaling pathway, and molecular mechanisms related to treatment sensitivity were sought. Cell viability was measured, and treatment responses between the cell lines were compared. To search for response predictors and genomic and transcriptomic profiling, PIK3CA mutations andPTEN status were explored and molecular features associated with drug sensitivity sought. The cell lines were divided into three groups according to the growth-retarding effect induced by trastuzumab and lapatinib. Interestingly, two cell lines insensitive to trastuzumab (KPL4 and SUM190PT) showed sensitivity to an Akt1/2 kinase inhibitor. These cell lines had mutation in PIK3CA and loss ofPTEN, suggesting an activated and druggable Akt-signaling pathway. Expression levels of five genes (CDC42,MAPK8,PLCG1,PTK6, andPAK6) were suggested as predictors for the Akt1/2 kinase-inhibitor response. Targeting the Akt-signaling pathway shows promise in cell lines that do not respond to trastuzumab. In addition, our results indicate that several molecular features determine the growth-retarding effects induced by the drugs, suggesting that parameters other than HER2 amplification/expression should be included as markers for therapy decisions.	0
Utilization of amplicon-based targeted sequencing panel for the massively parallel sequencing of sporadic hearing impairment patients from Saudi Arabia. || Adolescent Adult Cadherins Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool DNA Databases, Genetic Female Genotype Hearing Loss High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Membrane Proteins Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Reproducibility of Results Saudi Arabia Young Adult || Hearing Impairment (HI) can have genetic or environmental causes and in some cases, an interplay of both. Genetic causes are difficult to determine as mutations in more than 90 genes have been shown recently to be responsible for HI. Providing a genetic diagnostic test for HI is therefore a challenge especially for ethnic groups where GJB2 mutations are shown to be rare. Here we show the design and implementation of an amplicon-based targeted sequencing panel that allows the simultaneous sequencing of 87 HI genes. Mutations identified included known pathogenic mutations and novel variants with unknown significance. The diagnostic rate of this panel is 28 % when only pathogenic variants were reported. However, an additional 28 % harbored recurrent combinations of novel or rare single nucleotide variants in the OTOF or PCDH15 genes. Such combinations were not identified in healthy individuals. Targeted sequencing approach is a very useful strategy for the identification of mutations affecting the HI genes because of its relatively fast turn-around time and cost effectiveness compared to whole-exome sequencing. Further novel or rare variants could be identified by implementing a large-scale screening of HI using our panel which will eventual lead to a higher diagnostic rate.	4
[Detection of KRAS gene mutation and its clinical significance in colorectal adenocarcinoma]. ||  || To explore the clinical significance of KRAS mutation detection in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were obtained from 440 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. The genomic DNA was extracted. Mutations of exon 2 of KRAS gene were examined by PCR and direct sequencing. Somatic mutations of KRAS gene were identified in 146 cases, with the mutation rate of 33.2% (146/440). Among these 146 patients, KRAS mutation involved codon 12 in 118 patients, including 35G > A (Gly12Asp, 62 cases), 35G > T (Gly12Val, 35 cases), 34G > T (Gly12Cys, 9 cases), 34G > A (Gly12Ser, 6 cases), 35G > C (Gly12Ala, 5 cases), and 34G > C (Gly12Arg, 1 case); in 27 patients the mutation involved codon 13, including 38G > A (Gly13Asp, 25 cases), 38G > C (Gly13 Val, 1 case) and 37G > T (Gly13 Cys, 1 case); and in one patient, the mutation involved codon 14 with 40G > A (Val14Ile). The status of KRAS or codon 12 mutations in colorectal adenocarcinoma was related to patients' gender (P = 0.021 and P = 0.030, respectively), and this significant correlation to females was conserved in clinical stage III (P = 0.007 and P = 0.003, respectively), but not in stages I, II, and IV. The status of KRAS or codon 12 mutations was also related to tumor stage. Between stage II and stage IV, the mutation rate of KRAS and codon 12 showed significant difference (P = 0.028 and 0.034, respectively). Between stage III and stage IV, only the codon 12 mutation rate showed significant difference (P = 0.011). Codon 13 mutation was not related to tumor stage. About one third of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma have KRAS gene mutation, which might be related to patients' gender; and could be consistently detected by PCR and direct sequencing.	4
Understanding the dynamics of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric α-synuclein structures in water. ||  || Human α-synuclein (αS) is an intrinsically disordered protein associated with Parkinson's disease. Molecular mechanisms of corruptive misfolding and aggregation of αS resulting in the disease, as well as the structure and other properties of the corresponding oligomers are not entirely understood yet, preventing the development of efficient therapies. In this study, we investigate the folding dynamics of initially unfolded hypothetical αS constructs in water using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We also employ the novel essential collective dynamics method to analyze the results obtained from the simulations. Our comparative analysis of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric αS models reveals pronounced differences in their structure and stability, emphasizing the importance of small oligomers, particularly dimers, in the process of misfolding.	0
LC-MS/MS multiplex analysis of lysosphingolipids in plasma and amniotic fluid: A novel tool for the screening of sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C disease. || Adult Biomarkers Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Fabry Disease Female Humans Infant, Newborn Male Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C Prenatal Diagnosis Sensitivity and Specificity Sphingolipids Tandem Mass Spectrometry || The biological diagnosis of sphingolipidoses currently relies on the measurement of specific enzymatic activities and/or genetic studies. Lysosphingolipids have recently emerged as potential biomarkers of sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C in plasma. We developed a sensitive and specific method enabling the simultaneous quantification of lysosphingolipids by LC-MS/MS: lysoglobotriaosylceramide for Fabry disease, lysohexosylceramide (i.e. lysoglucosylceramide and/or lysogalactosylceramide) for Gaucher and Krabbe diseases, lysosphingomyelin and its carboxylated analogue lysosphingomyelin-509 for Niemann-Pick type A or B, and C diseases, lysoGM1 ganglioside for GM1gangliosidosis and lysoGM2 ganglioside for GM2 gangliosidosis. The diagnostic performances were validated in plasma samples analysing a large series of patients affected with sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C disease (n = 98), other inborn errors of metabolism (n = 23), and controls (n = 228). The multiplex measurement of lysosphingolipids allowed the screening of Fabry (including female patients and late-onset variants), Gaucher and infantile Krabbe, Niemann-Pick type A/B and C diseases with high sensitivity and specificity. LysoGM1 and LysoGM2 were elevated in most of the patients affected with GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis respectively. In amniotic fluid supernatant from pregnancies presenting non-immune hydrops fetalis (n = 77, including previously diagnosed Gaucher (n = 5), GM1 gangliosidosis (n = 4) and galactosialidosis (n = 4) fetuses) and from normal pregnancies (n = 15), a specific and dramatic increase of lysohexosylceramide was observed only in the Gaucher amniotic fluid samples. This multiplex assay which allows the simultaneous measurement of lysosphingolipids in plasma modifies the diagnostic strategy of sphingolipidoses and Niemann-Pick type C. Furthermore, in pregnancies presenting non-immune hydrops fetalis, lysohexosylceramide measurement in amniotic fluid offers a rapid screening of fetal Gaucher disease without waiting for glucocerebrosidase activity measurement in cultured amniocytes.	4
Analysis of a Finnish family confirms RHBDF2 mutations as the underlying factor in tylosis with esophageal cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carrier Proteins Esophageal Neoplasms Female Finland Humans Keratoderma, Palmoplantar, Diffuse Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree || Tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC) is a rare familial cancer syndrome inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner and characterized by esophageal cancer susceptibility and hyperkeratotic skin lesions. Two heterozygous missense mutations in the RHBDF2 gene were recently reported to be associated with TOC in three families: a p.Ile186Thr mutation was found in families from the UK and the US and a p.Pro189Leu mutation was detected in a German TOC family. We aimed to validate these novel results in an independent material by screening RHBDF2 in a previously unreported Finnish TOC family. We identified a new missense mutation, p.Asp188Asn, segregating with TOC in the Finnish family, and interestingly the detected mutation alters a codon located between the two previously reported mutation sites. Thus, we confirmed RHBDF2 mutations as the underlying cause of the TOC syndrome and our results suggest that the TOC associated mutations might be specific for this particular site in the RHBDF2 gene. These results enable the genetic counseling and diagnostic mutation screening of the members of TOC families.	4
Emerging Non-Canonical Functions and Regulation by p53: p53 and Stemness. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Humans Neoplastic Stem Cells Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Since its discovery nearly 40 years ago, p53 has ascended to the forefront of investigated genes and proteins across diverse research disciplines and is recognized most exclusively for its role in cancer as a tumor suppressor. Levine and Oren (2009) reviewed the evolution of p53 detailing the significant discoveries of each decade since its first report in 1979. In this review, we will highlight the emerging non-canonical functions and regulation of p53 in stem cells. We will focus on general themes shared among p53's functions in non-malignant stem cells and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and the influence of p53 on the microenvironment and CSC niche. We will also examine p53 gain of function (GOF) roles in stemness. Mutant p53 (mutp53) GOFs that lead to survival, drug resistance and colonization are reviewed in the context of the acquisition of advantageous transformation processes, such as differentiation and dedifferentiation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem cell senescence and quiescence. Finally, we will conclude with therapeutic strategies that restore wild-type p53 (wtp53) function in cancer and CSCs, including RING finger E3 ligases and CSC maintenance. The mechanisms by whichwtp53 andmutp53 influence stemness in non-malignant stem cells and CSCs or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are poorly understood thus far. Further elucidation of p53's effects on stemness could lead to novel therapeutic strategies in cancer research.	0
Clinical and molecular characterization of 112 single-center patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1. || Adolescent Adult Age Factors Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1 Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Italy Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Neurofibromatosis 1 Prevalence Prognosis Retrospective Studies Risk Assessment Sex Factors Young Adult || The aim of this retrospective study was to define clinical and molecular characteristics of a large sample of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients, as well as to evaluate mutational spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation. NF1 is a relatively common neurogenetic disorder (1:2500-1:3000 individuals). It is caused by mutations of the NF1 gene on chromosome 17ql1.2, with autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and wide phenotypical variability. Café-au-lait spots (CALs), cutaneous and/or subcutaneous neurofibromas (CNFs/SCNFs), skinfold freckling, skeletal abnormalities, Lisch nodules of the iris and increased risk of learning and intellectual disabilities, as well as tumors of the nervous system and other organs are its main clinical features. The preliminary group collected 168 subjects with clinical suspicion of NF1. They were evaluated following the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria for NF1, revised by Gutmann et al. 1997, integrated for 67 of them by molecular testing. According to these references, 112 of 168 patients were diagnosed as NF1. The sample was characterized by an equal sex ratio (57 males, 55 females) and age distribution ranging from 10 days to 60 years of age (mean age, 13 years). A wide spectrum of clinical features has been observed in our patients. Mutational analysis resulted positive in 51 cases (76%). Twenty-four mutations detected in our cohort have not been reported to date. This study may contribute to a better definition of genotypic and phenotypic features of NF1 patients, with respect to further insights into the clinical characterization of the disease. In addition, an amplification of the spectrum of mutations in the NF1 gene has been documented.	4
A termination mutant prevalent in Norwegian haplotype 7 phenylketonuria genes. || Adolescent Adult Base Sequence Blotting, Southern Child Child, Preschool Female Genes Haplotypes Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Norway Pedigree Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Restriction Mapping || RFLPs in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene locus were determined in 47 Norwegian nuclear families that had at least one child with phenylketonuria (PKU). The PKU haplotype distribution differed somewhat from that of other European populations. Mutant haplotype 7 is relatively rare in other populations but constituted 20% of all mutant haplotypes in Norway. In 14 of the 17 mutant haplotypes 7, a previously unreported deletion of the BamHI restriction site in exon 7 of the PAH gene was observed. The abrogation of the BamHI site was shown to be due to a G-to-T transversion, changing Gly 272 to Ter 272 in exon 7 of the gene, thus directly identifying the PKU mutation. Unlike the families of the other PKU patients, the families with this mutation clustered along the southeastern coast of Norway, suggesting a founder effect for this mutation.	3

Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples collected from 46 children and their parents (110 cases). All the children received the CI. Their parents had normal auditory phenotype. PCR was performed and the products were sequenced by automated DNA sequencer to detect the hot spots of mutations. The detection rates of GJB2 235delC (13.0%) and 109G>A (24.0%) mutations were significantly higher than other mutations. SLC26A was the secondary major mutation (13.0%). We found out that no patient carried the mitochondrial 12S rRNA mutations. Leukoencephalopathy, hyperbilirubinemia and hypoxic-ischemic injure were disclosed in 7 patients (15.2%). The rate of mutations in parents was 36.0% (23/64). There had no difference between Han and other racial minorities (P>0.05). The CI recipients in Yunnan with a high frequency of 235 delC and 109 G>A mutation, IVS7-2A>G (6.5%) is also a common mutation related hearing loss; aminoglycoside antibiotics may not be the main reason which induced congenital deaf in CI children; environment facts was suggested to contribute another important cause. The hot-spots gene screening for the C1 children could offer an accurate genetic counseling for early diagnosis and treatment, it also provide evidences for the clinical analysis between mutations and curative effect.	4
Differential effects of PCSK9 variants on risk of coronary disease and ischaemic stroke. ||  || PCSK9 genetic variants that have large effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD) have prompted the development of therapeutic PCSK9-inhibition. However, there is limited evidence that PCSK9 variants are associated with ischaemic stroke (IS). Associations of the loss-of-function PCSK9 genetic variant (rs11591147; R46L), and five additional PCSK9 variants, with IS and IS subtypes (cardioembolic, large vessel, and small vessel) were estimated in a meta-analysis involving 10 307 IS cases and 19 326 controls of European ancestry. They were then compared with the associations of these variants with LDL-C levels (in up to 172 970 individuals) and CHD (in up to 60 801 CHD cases and 123 504 controls). The rs11591147 T allele was associated with 0.5 mmol/L lower LDL-C level (P = 9 × 10-143) and 23% lower CHD risk [odds ratio (OR): 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-0.87, P = 7 × 10-6]. However, it was not associated with risk of IS (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.84-1.28, P = 0.74) or IS subtypes. Information from additional PCSK9 variants also indicated consistently weaker effects on IS than on CHD. PCSK9 genetic variants that confer life-long lower PCSK9 and LDL-C levels appear to have significantly weaker, if any, associations with risk of IS than with risk of CHD. By contrast, similar proportional reductions in risks of IS and CHD have been observed in randomized trials of therapeutic PCSK9-inhibition. These findings have implications for our understanding of when Mendelian randomization can be relied upon to predict the effects of therapeutic interventions.	4
Correlation analysis of phenotype and genotype of GJB2 in patients with non-syndromic hearing loss in China. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexins Female Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Phenotype Young Adult || Disease-associated mutations in GJB2 gene are one of the major reasons that can cause non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL). GJB2 gene deafness has various clinical phenotypes. This study aims to analyze characteristics and relationships of clinical phenotypes through analyzing 1481 NSHL cases and 190 GJB2 deafness patients (with dual gene mutations). All the patients diagnosed as deaf disease molecular diagnostics were obtained from the people's liberation army general hospital from March 2007 to March 2011. The accession number of GJB2 was NM_004004 in GenBank, and sequence alignment and annotation were performed using GeneTool software. In NSHL patients, mutated allele frequency in GJB2 was 20.57%, and the preponderant type was c.235delC (11.84%) followed by c.109G>A (3.75%). Mutation rate of double allelic gene was 16.18%, including 8.43% of homozygous mutation rate and 7.75% of recombination heterozygosis mutation. Moreover, auditory threshold of GJB2 biallelic marker was associated with ages of onset, while no significant correlation was detected with disease time and whether the inner ear malformation. Similar clinical phenotype could be detected between patients with c.109G>A dual gene mutation and dual gene mutation. However, in the aspect of hearing impairment, the phenomenon of pathopoiesia caused by mutation of c.109G>A was poorer than the other mutations, and even near those patients without pathogenic mutations. Our study further shows the definite relationship of clinical phenotype and genotype in GJB2 gene correlated deafness, and these results can provide basis for revealing pathogenesis, gene diagnosis and consult of deafness. The level of evidence in the study is level 4 (case series).	4
Whole exome sequencing of urachal adenocarcinoma reveals recurrent NF1 mutations. || Adenocarcinoma Aged, 80 and over Female Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1 Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neurofibromin 1 Urinary Bladder Neoplasms Whole Exome Sequencing Young Adult || Urachal adenocarcinoma is a rare bladder malignancy arising from the urachal remnant. Given its rarity and the lack of knowledge about its genetic characteristics, optimal management of this cancer is not well defined. Practice patterns vary and outcomes remain poor. In order to identify the genomic underpinnings of this malignancy, we performed whole exome sequencing using seven tumor/normal pairs of formalin fixed archival specimens. We identified recurrent evidence of MAP-kinase pathway activation as three patients had neurofibromin 1 (NF1) mutations, with one of these patients also harboring an oncogenic KRAS G13D mutation. We also observed recurrent evidence of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation as three patients had oncogenic mutations in APC or RNF43. In addition, somatic copy number analysis revealed focal chromosome 12p amplifications in three samples, resembling findings from testicular germ cell tumors. We describe the genomic landscape of this malignancy in our institutional cohort and propose investigation of the therapeutic potential for MAP-K pathway inhibition in the subset of patients who show evidence of its activation.	4
Human Pompe disease-induced pluripotent stem cells for pathogenesis modeling, drug testing and disease marker identification. || Adenine Animals Base Sequence Biomarkers Carnitine Cell Differentiation Drug Monitoring Fibroblasts Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Mice Models, Biological Molecular Sequence Data Myocytes, Cardiac alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene, which encodes GAA. Although enzyme replacement therapy has recently improved patient survival greatly, the results in skeletal muscles and for advanced disease are still not satisfactory. Here, we report the derivation of Pompe disease-induced pluripotent stem cells (PomD-iPSCs) from two patients with different GAA mutations and their potential for pathogenesis modeling, drug testing and disease marker identification. PomD-iPSCs maintained pluripotent features and had low GAA activity and high glycogen content. Cardiomyocyte-like cells (CMLCs) differentiated from PomD-iPSCs recapitulated the hallmark Pompe disease pathophysiological phenotypes, including high levels of glycogen and multiple ultrastructural aberrances. Drug rescue assessment showed that exposure of PomD-iPSC-derived CMLCs to recombinant human GAA reversed the major pathologic phenotypes. Furthermore, l-carnitine treatment reduced defective cellular respiration in the diseased cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis, we identified glycogen metabolism, lysosome and mitochondria-related marker genes whose expression robustly correlated with the therapeutic effect of drug treatment in PomD-iPSC-derived CMLCs. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PomD-iPSCs are a promising in vitro disease model for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for Pompe disease.	1
Dermatological phenotype in Costello syndrome: consequences of Ras dysregulation in development. || Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Child Child, Preschool Costello Syndrome Cross-Sectional Studies Female Foot Dermatoses Genes, ras Hair Diseases Hand Dermatoses Humans Infant Male Papilloma Phenotype Pigmentation Disorders Skin Diseases Skin Neoplasms Young Adult || The RASopathies are a class of human genetic syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes that encode protein components of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Costello syndrome (CS) is a RASopathy caused by mutations in the HRAS gene, a key regulator of signal transduction. To quantify the specific cutaneous phenotype observed in 46 individuals with Costello syndrome with confirmed HRAS mutations. This was a cross-sectional study. Dermatological surveys were designed by the authors and were completed by parents of mutation-positive individuals with CS at the Costello Syndrome Family Network (CSFN) conferences in 2007 and 2009. Dermatological examinations were performed by the authors at the CSFN conferences. Cutaneous papillomas were reported in 33 of the 46 (72%) participants, with age of onset ranging from infancy to 22years. Individuals with CS are more likely than patients with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC) to present with cutaneous papillomas (72% vs. 5%, P<0·001) and palmoplantar keratoderma (76% vs. 36%, P<0·001). Individuals with CS are less likely than individuals with CFC to present with sparse or absent eyebrows (9% vs. 90%, P<0·001) or keratosis pilaris (33% vs. 80%, P=0·001). This study also identified that loose, redundant skin on the hands and feet, 'stippled' dermatoglyphs (pachydermatoglyphia) on the fingertips (eight of 26, 31%) and acanthosis nigricans (17 of 46, 37%) are frequent features of CS. While there is significant phenotypic overlap among syndromes of the Ras/MAPK pathway, individuals with CS are more likely than individuals with CFC syndrome to present with cutaneous papillomas, palmoplantar keratoderma and full eyebrows, and are less likely to present with ulerythema ophryogenes, keratosis pilaris or multiple naevi. The dermatological features of CS, a Ras dysregulation syndrome, share many features with cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes. This may provide further insight into the role of Ras signalling in cutaneous paraneoplastic syndromes.	4

Mutation analysis of TMC1 identifies four new mutations and suggests an additional deafness gene at loci DFNA36 and DFNB7/11. || DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Exons Family Gene Dosage Genetic Linkage Hearing Loss Humans Membrane Proteins Mutation || Hearing loss is the most frequent sensorineural disorder affecting 1 in 1000 newborns. In more than half of these babies, the hearing loss is inherited. Hereditary hearing loss is a very heterogeneous trait with about 100 gene localizations and 44 gene identifications for non-syndromic hearing loss. Transmembrane channel-like gene 1 (TMC1) has been identified as the disease-causing gene for autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss at the DFNA36 and DFNB7/11 loci, respectively. To date, 2 dominant and 18 recessive TMC1 mutations have been reported as the cause of hearing loss in 34 families. In this report, we describe linkage to DFNA36 and DFNB7/11 in 1 family with dominant and 10 families with recessive non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. In addition, mutation analysis of TMC1 was performed in 51 familial Turkish patients with autosomal recessive hearing loss. TMC1 mutations were identified in seven of the families segregating recessive hearing loss. The pathogenic variants we found included two known mutations, c.100C>T and c.1165C>T, and four new mutations, c.2350C>T, c.776+1G>A, c.767delT and c.1166G>A. The absence of TMC1 mutations in the remaining six linked families implies the presence of mutations outside the coding region of this gene or alternatively at least one additional deafness-causing gene in this region. The analysis of copy number variations in TMC1 as well as DNA sequencing of 15 additional candidate genes did not reveal any proven pathogenic changes, leaving both hypotheses open.	4
The RASopathies. || Animals Congenital Abnormalities Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Neoplasms ras Proteins || The RASopathies are a clinically defined group of medical genetic syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components or regulators of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. These disorders include neurofibromatosis type 1, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Legius syndrome. Because of the common underlying Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation, the RASopathies exhibit numerous overlapping phenotypic features. The Ras/MAPK pathway plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle and cellular growth, differentiation, and senescence, all of which are critical to normal development. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The Ras/MAPK pathway has been well studied in cancer and is an attractive target for small-molecule inhibition to treat various malignancies. The use of these molecules to ameliorate developmental defects in the RASopathies is under consideration.	0
Association between minihaplotypes and mutations at the PAH locus in Polish hyperphenylalaninemic patients. ||  || Hereditary hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a disorder of amino acid metabolism and results from an insufficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). HPA phenotypes form a spectrum ranging from classical phenylketonuria (PKU) to mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). The phenotypic diversity reflects heterogeneity at the molecular level, and more than 320 different mutations in the PAH gene are known to date. The association of 3 mutations (R408W, IVS10 and A403V) common in different European populations with a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and short tandem repeat sites (minihaplotype) in the PAH gene was examined in a group of Polish PKU and MHP patients. Additionally, minihaplotypes were established for another 16 mutations. The presented data support the hypothesis that the R408W/VNTR3/STR238 allele originated among pre-Indo-Europeans on the territory in present-day Lithuania and Belarus. Mutation IVS10nt-11g-->a (IVS10) is strongly associated with VNTR7/STR250 minihaplotype and is possibly of Mediterranean origin.	1 3
Mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and prenatal diagnosis of phenylketonuria in Shaanxi, China. || Amniotic Fluid Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child, Preschool China DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Counseling Genetic Testing Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Neonatal Screening Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis || This study aims to investigate the spectrum and frequency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations and the power to prenatally diagnose phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Shaanxi, China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing analyses were performed to examine the PAH gene in 33 PKU patients and seven amniotic fluid samples. Thirty-four pathogenic variants were indicated in all 63 alleles, in which two probands carried three variants. Pedigree analysis suggested that the [c.158G>A([p.R53H)][IVS7+2T>A] mutation was located at the same chromatid. However, there was a controversial viewpoint that thought the c.158G>A(p.R53H) variant was a polymorphism in the Chinese. We also found one novel indel mutation and identified the c.59_60delAGinsCC mutation of the PAH gene for the very first time. The spectrum of the PAH mutations in Shaanxi Province were similar to that among China's population. Based on the results of PAH gene analysis, we further performed prenatal genetic diagnoses for seven PKU families. All foetuses were definitively diagnosed, and their parents were provided with genetic counselling. PAH gene analysis is a crucial method for PKU diagnosis and prenatal genetic prognosis, even though many uncommon mutations would affect the analysis and diagnosis of genetic abnormalities.	3
Low LDL cholesterol, <i>PCSK9</i> and <i>HMGCR</i> genetic variation, and risk of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Mendelian randomisation study. ||  || <b>Objective</b> To test the hypothesis that low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol due to genetic variation in the genes responsible for LDL cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis(<i>PCSK9</i> and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (<i>HMGCR</i>), respectively) is associated with a high risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, any dementia, and Parkinson's disease in the general population.<b>Design</b> Mendelian randomisation study.<b>Setting</b> Copenhagen General Population Study and Copenhagen City Heart Study.<b>Participants</b> 111 194 individuals from the Danish general population.<b>Main outcome measures</b> Risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, all dementia, and Parkinson's disease.<b>Results</b> In observational analyses, the multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio for Parkinson's disease in participants with an LDL cholesterol level <1.8 mmol/L versus ≥4.0 mmol/L was 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.79), whereas the corresponding hazard ratios for Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or any dementia did not differ from 1.0. <i>PCSK9</i> and <i>HMGCR</i> variants combined were associated with a 9.3% lower LDL cholesterol level. In genetic, causal analyses adjusted for age, sex, and year of birth, the risk ratios for a lifelong 1 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol level were 0.57 (0.27 to 1.17) for Alzheimer's disease, 0.81 (0.34 to 1.89) for vascular dementia, 0.66 (0.34 to 1.26) for any dementia, and 1.02 (0.26 to 4.00) for Parkinson's disease. Summary level data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project using Egger Mendelian randomisation analysis gave a risk ratio for Alzheimer's disease of 0.24 (0.02 to 2.79) for 26 <i>PCSK9</i> and <i>HMGCR</i> variants, and of 0.64 (0.52 to 0.79) for 380 variants of LDL cholesterol level lowering.<b>Conclusion</b> Low LDL cholesterol levels due to <i>PCSK9</i> and <i>HMGCR</i> variants had no causal effect on high risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, any dementia, or Parkinson's disease; however, low LDL cholesterol levels may have a causal effect in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease.	4
Phenotypic analyses and mutation screening of the SLC26A4 and FOXI1 genes in 101 Taiwanese families with bilateral nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (DFNB4) or Pendred syndrome. ||  || Recessive mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are responsible for nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and Pendred syndrome. However, in some affected families, only 1 or 0 mutated allele can be identified, as well as no clear correlation between SLC26A4 genotypes and clinical phenotypes, hampering the accuracy of genetic counseling. To elucidate the genetic composition of nonsyndromic EVA and Pendred syndrome, we screened related genomic fragments, including the SLC26A4 coding regions, the SLC26A4 promoter and the FOXI1 transcription factor gene, in 101 Taiwanese families, and analyzed their phenotypic and genotypic results. Mutation screening in the SLC26A4 coding regions by direct sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction detected 2 mutations in 63 (62%) families, 1 mutation in 24 (24%) families and no mutation in 14 (14%) families. The radiological findings, the presence of goiters and the audiological results were not different among probands (i.e. index cases of the families) with different SLC26A4 genotypes. Specifically, probands heterozygous for SLC26A4 mutations demonstrated clinical features indistinguishable from those of probands with 2 mutated alleles, implicating that there might be undetected mutations. However, except for a variant (c.-2554G>A of SLC26A4) with possible pathological consequences, no definite mutation was detected after extensive screening in the SLC26A4 promoter and FOXI1. In other words, in most Taiwanese families nonsyndromic EVA or Pendred syndrome might not result from aberrance in the transcriptional control of SLC26A4 by FOXI1. Meanwhile, exploration of undetected mutations in the SLC26A4 noncoding regions revealed 9 divergent haplotypes among the 21 no-mutation-detected SLC26A4 alleles of the c.919-2A>G heterozygotes, indicating that there might be no common and predominant mutations in the SLC26A4 introns.	1
Identification of a genetic cause for isolated unilateral coronal synostosis: a unique mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. || Craniosynostoses Female Fibroblast Growth Factors Genes, Dominant Humans Male Mutation Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor || To determine whether the autosomal dominant fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) Pro250Arg mutation causes anterior plagiocephaly, patients with either apparently sporadic unicoronal synostosis (N = 37) or other forms of anterior plagiocephaly (N = 10) were studied for this mutation. Of 37 patients with unicoronal synostosis, 4 tested positive for the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3, and 33 were negative for this mutation. In three mutation positive patients with full parental studies, a parent with an extremely mild phenotype was found to carry the same mutation. None of the 6 patients with nonsynostotic plagiocephaly and none of the 4 patients with additional suture synostosis had the FGFR3 mutation. Because it is impossible to predict the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation status based on clinical examination alone, all patients with unicoronal synostosis should be tested for it. To assess their recurrence risk, all parents of mutation positive patients should be tested regardless of their clinical findings, because the phenotype can be extremely variable and without craniosynostosis.	4
Apocrine-eccrine carcinomas: molecular and immunohistochemical analyses. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Apocrine Glands Carcinoma Eccrine Glands ErbB Receptors Female Humans Immunohistochemistry In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Male Middle Aged Receptor, ErbB-2 Young Adult || Apocrine-eccrine carcinomas are rare and associated with poor prognosis. Currently there is no uniform treatment guideline. Chemotherapeutic drugs that selectively target cancer-promoting pathways may complement conventional therapeutic approaches. However, studies on genetic alterations and EGFR and Her2 status of apocrine-eccrine carcinomas are few in number. In addition, hormonal studies have not been comprehensive and performed only on certain subsets of apocrine-eccrine carcinomas. To investigate whether apocrine-eccrine carcinomas express hormonal receptors or possess activation of oncogenic pathways that can be targeted by available chemotherapeutic agent we performed immunohistochemistry for AR, PR, ER, EGFR, and HER2 expression; fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for EGFR and ERBB2 gene amplification; and molecular analyses for recurrent mutations in 15 cancer genes including AKT-1, EGFR, PIK3CA, and TP53 on 54 cases of apocrine-eccrine carcinomas. They include 10 apocrine carcinomas, 7 eccrine carcinomas, 9 aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinomas, 10 hidradenocarcinomas, 11 porocarcinomas, 1 adenoid cystic carcinoma, 4 malignant chondroid syringomas, 1 malignant spiradenoma, and 1 malignant cylindroma. AR, ER, PR, EGFR and HER2 expression was seen in 36% (19/53), 27% (14/51), 16% (8/51), 85% (44/52) and 12% (6/52), respectively. Polysomy or trisomy of EGFR was detected by FISH in 30% (14/46). Mutations of AKT-1, PIK3CA, and TP53 were detected in 1, 3, and 7 cases, respectively (11/47, 23%). Additional investigation regarding the potential treatment of rare cases of apocrine-eccrine carcinomas with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors, currently in clinical testing, may be of clinical interest.	4
Mutational profiling can identify laryngeal dysplasia at risk of progression to invasive carcinoma. ||  || Early diagnosis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) at the stage of dysplasia could greatly improve the outcome of affected patients. For the first time we compared the mutational landscape of non-progressing dysplasia (NPD; n = 42) with progressing dysplasia (PD; n = 24), along with patient-matched LSCC biopsies; a total of 90 samples. Using targeted next-generation sequencing identified non-synonymous mutations in six genes (PIK3CA, FGFR3, TP53, JAK3, MET, FBXW7), and mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing and/or qPCR. Analysis was extended in silico to 530 head and neck (HNSCC) cases using TCGA data. Mutations in PIK3CA and FGFR3 were detected in PD and LSCC cases, as well as other HNSCC cases, but absent in NPD cases. In contrast, mutations in JAK3, MET and FBXW7 were found in NPD cases but not PD, LSCC or other HNSCC cases. TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene in both PD and NPD cases. With the exception of R248W, mutations were mutually exclusive. Moreover, five of seven PD mutations were located in motif H2 of p53, whereas none of the NPD mutations were. In summary, we propose that the mutational profile of laryngeal dysplasia has utility for the early detection of patients at risk of progression.	4
p53 regulates biosynthesis through direct inactivation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Dimerization Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Glucose Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Humans Lipids Neoplasms Oxidative Stress Pentose Phosphate Pathway Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cancer cells consume large quantities of glucose and primarily use glycolysis for ATP production, even in the presence of adequate oxygen. This metabolic signature (aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect) enables cancer cells to direct glucose to biosynthesis, supporting their rapid growth and proliferation. However, both causes of the Warburg effect and its connection to biosynthesis are not well understood. Here we show that the tumour suppressor p53, the most frequently mutated gene in human tumours, inhibits the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Through the PPP, p53 suppresses glucose consumption, NADPH production and biosynthesis. The p53 protein binds to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, and prevents the formation of the active dimer. Tumour-associated p53 mutants lack the G6PD-inhibitory activity. Therefore, enhanced PPP glucose flux due to p53 inactivation may increase glucose consumption and direct glucose towards biosynthesis in tumour cells.	0
Normal passive viscoelasticity but abnormal myofibrillar force generation in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Biomechanical Phenomena Calcium Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Elasticity Humans Isometric Contraction Kinetics Myocytes, Cardiac Myofibrils Sarcomeres Stress, Physiological Viscosity || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, increased ventricular stiffness and impaired diastolic filling. We investigated to what extent myocardial functional defects can be explained by alterations in the passive and active properties of human cardiac myofibrils. Skinned ventricular myocytes were prepared from patients with obstructive HCM (two patients with MYBPC3 mutations, one with a MYH7 mutation, and three with no mutation in either gene) and from four donors. Passive stiffness, viscous properties, and titin isoform expression were similar in HCM myocytes and donor myocytes. Maximal Ca(2+)-activated force was much lower in HCM myocytes (14 ± 1 kN/m(2)) than in donor myocytes (23 ± 3 kN/m(2); P<0.01), though cross-bridge kinetics (k(tr)) during maximal Ca(2)(+) activation were 10% faster in HCM myocytes. Myofibrillar Ca(2)(+) sensitivity in HCM myocytes (pCa(50)=6.40 ± 0.05) was higher than for donor myocytes (pCa(50)=6.09 ± 0.02; P<0.001) and was associated with reduced phosphorylation of troponin-I (ser-23/24) and MyBP-C (ser-282) in HCM myocytes. These characteristics were common to all six HCM patients and may therefore represent a secondary consequence of the known and unknown underlying genetic variants. Some HCM patients did however exhibit an altered relationship between force and cross-bridge kinetics at submaximal Ca(2+) concentrations, which may reflect the primary mutation. We conclude that the passive viscoelastic properties of the myocytes are unlikely to account for the increased stiffness of the HCM ventricle. However, the low maximum Ca(2+)-activated force and high Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilaments are likely to contribute substantially to any systolic and diastolic dysfunction, respectively, in hearts of HCM patients.	4
Mutational profiling reveals PIK3CA mutations in gallbladder carcinoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Bile Duct Neoplasms Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic Carcinoma Cholangiocarcinoma Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gallbladder Neoplasms Genes, ras Humans Liver Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Validation Studies as Topic || The genetics of advanced biliary tract cancers (BTC), which encompass intra- and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas as well as gallbladder carcinomas, are heterogeneous and remain to be fully defined. To better characterize mutations in established known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes we tested a mass spectrometric based platform to interrogate common cancer associated mutations across a panel of 77 formalin fixed paraffin embedded archived BTC cases. Mutations among three genes, KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA were confirmed in this cohort. Activating mutations in PIK3CA were identified exclusively in GBC (4/32, 12.5%). KRAS mutations were identified in 3 (13%) intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 1 (33%) perihillar cholangiocarcinoma but were not identified in gallbladder carcinomas and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of activating mutations in PIK3CA specifically in GBC has clinical implications in both the diagnosis of this cancer type, as well as the potential utility of targeted therapies such as PI3 kinase inhibitors.	4
Differential involvement of E2A-corepressor interactions in distinct leukemogenic pathways. || Amino Acids Animals Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors Carcinogenesis Cell Line, Tumor Co-Repressor Proteins Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HEK293 Cells Homeodomain Proteins Humans Leukemia Mice NIH 3T3 Cells Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein Transcriptional Activation || E2A is a member of the E-protein family of transcription factors. Previous studies have reported context-dependent regulation of E2A-dependent transcription. For example, whereas the E2A portion of the E2A-Pbx1 leukemia fusion protein mediates robust transcriptional activation in t(1;19) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the transcriptional activity of wild-type E2A is silenced by high levels of corepressors, such as the AML1-ETO fusion protein in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia and ETO-2 in hematopoietic cells. Here, we show that, unlike the HEB E-protein, the activation domain 1 (AD1) of E2A has specifically reduced corepressor interaction due to E2A-specific amino acid changes in the p300/CBP and ETO target motif. Replacing E2A-AD1 with HEB-AD1 abolished the ability of E2A-Pbx1 to activate target genes and to induce cell transformation. On the other hand, the weak E2A-AD1-corepressor interaction imposes a critical importance on another ETO-interacting domain, downstream ETO-interacting sequence (DES), for corepressor-mediated repression. Deletion of DES abrogates silencing of E2A activity by AML1-ETO in t(8;21) leukemia cells or by ETO-2 in normal hematopoietic cells. Our results reveal an E2A-specific mechanism important for its context-dependent activation and repression function, and provide the first evidence for the differential involvement of E2A-corepressor interactions in distinct leukemogenic pathways.	0
Vimentin regulates differentiation switch via modulation of keratin 14 levels and their expression together correlates with poor prognosis in oral cancer patients. || Animals Cell Differentiation Cell Line, Tumor Down-Regulation Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Keratin-14 Keratin-5 Male Mice Mouth Neoplasms Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Prognosis Receptors, Notch Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins Vimentin || Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein, predominantly expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin, although its aberrant expression is seen in many carcinomas during epithelial mesenchymal transition. In cancer, vimentin expression is associated with the transition from a more differentiated epithelial phenotype to a dedifferentiated state. In view of the perceived role of keratins (Ks) as regulators of differentiation in epithelia, it was important to understand whether vimentin modulates differentiation through the reprogramming of keratins, in transformed cells. To address this, vimentin was stably downregulated in oral cancer derived cells. Further, global keratin profiling was performed after high salt keratin extraction. K5/K14 pair was found to be significantly downregulated, both at protein and mRNA levels upon vimentin downregulation. The previous study from our laboratory has shown a role of the K5/K14 pair in proliferation and differentiation of squamous epithelial cells. Vimentin depleted cells showed an increase in the differentiation state, marked by an increase in the levels of differentiation specific markers K1, involucrin, filaggrin and loricrin while its proliferation status remained unchanged. Rescue experiments with the K5/K14 pair overexpressed in vimentin knockdown background resulted in decreased differentiation state. ΔNp63 emerged as one of the indirect targets of vimentin, through which it modulates the expression levels of K5/K14. Further, immunohistochemistry showed a significant correlation between high vimentin-K14 expression and recurrence/poor survival in oral cancer patients. Thus, in conclusion, vimentin regulates the differentiation switch via modulation of K5/K14 expression. Moreover, vimentin-K14 together may prove to be the novel markers for the prognostication of human oral cancer.	0
The reactive tumor microenvironment: MUC1 signaling directly reprograms transcription of CTGF. || Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Connective Tissue Growth Factor Extracellular Matrix Gene Expression Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Immunoblotting Mucin-1 Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Pancreatic Neoplasms Phosphorylation Promoter Regions, Genetic Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Signal Transduction Transcription, Genetic || The MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (MUC1.CT) conducts signals from spatial and extracellular cues (growth factor and cytokine stimulation) to evoke a reprogramming of the cellular transcriptional profile. Specific phosphorylated forms of the MUC1.CT achieve this function by differentially associating with transcription factors and redirecting their transcriptional regulatory capabilities at specific gene regulatory elements. The specificity of interaction between MUC1.CT and several transcription factors is dictated by the phosphorylation pattern of the 18 potential phosphorylation motifs within the MUC1.CT. To better appreciate the scope of differential gene expression triggered by MUC1.CT activation, we performed microarray gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-chip promoter analysis and identified the genome-wide transcriptional targets of MUC1.CT signaling in pancreatic cancer. On a global scale, MUC1.CT preferentially targets genes related to invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis, suggesting that MUC1.CT signaling contributes to establishing a reactive tumor microenvironment during tumor progression to metastatic disease. We examined in detail the molecular mechanisms of MUC1.CT signaling that induces the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2), a potent mediator of ECM remodeling and angiogenesis. We demonstrate a robust induction of CTGF synthesis and secretion in response to serum factors that is enabled only when MUC1 is highly expressed. We demonstrate the requirement of phosphorylation at distinct tyrosine motifs within the MUC1.CT for MUC1-induced CTGF expression and demonstrate a phosphorylation-specific localization of MUC1.CT to the CTGF promoter. We found that MUC1 reorganizes transcription factor occupancy of genomic regions upstream of the CTGF gene, directing β-catenin and mutant p53 to CTGF gene regulatory elements to promote CTGF expression and destabilizing the interaction at these regions of the transcriptional repressor, c-Jun. With this example we illustrate the capacity of MUC1.CT to mediate transcription factor activity in a context-dependent manner to achieve wide spread and robust changes in gene expression and facilitate creation of the reactive tumor microenvironment.	0
[Analysis on correlation between GJB2 mutations and congenital malformations of inner ear]. || Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Ear, Inner Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Infant Male Mutation Retrospective Studies || To analyze the correlation between GJB2 mutations and congenital malformations of inner ear in pediatric patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Peripheral blood samples were collected from 77 pediatric patients with congenital malformations of inner ear. Two control groups were set up, which were control group 1 that contained 80 pediatric patients with congenital SNHL without inner ear malformations, and control group 2 that contained 100 cases with normal hearing, retrospectively. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood; direct sequencing was used to detect GJB2 mutations. GJB2 was normal in 31 patients. GJB2 mutations were detected in 12 patients while the polymorphism of GJB2 was present in 34 patients. The homozygous mutations of 235delC was in 1 patient, the heterozygous carriers of 235delC in 4 patients, the heterozygous carriers of p. V37I in 7 patients in which the heterozygous carriers of p. R184Q with autosomal dominant hereditary in 1 patients. In control group 1, normal GJB2 was detected in 17 patients, GJB2 mutation in 29 patients, polymorphism in 34 patients. In control group 2, normal GJB2 was detected in 18 patients, GJB2 mutation in 12 patients, polymorphism in 70 patients. When the distribution of GJB2 genotypes was compared with phenotypes, significant difference was found (P < 0.01) between inner ear malformations and control group 1, but was not (P > 0.05) between inner ear malformations and control group 2. GJB2 Mutations are not correlated with congenital inner ear malformations. However, GJB2 Mutations are correlated with congenital SNHL that is not caused by congenital malformations of inner ear.	4

Here we aimed to validate the occurrence, phenotype and clinicopathological characteristics of RHOA mutant GCs in an independent Central European GC cohort consisting of 415 patients. The RHOA genotype (exon 2 and 3) was correlated with various genotypic, phenotypic and clinicopathological patient characteristics. Sixteen (3.9%) tumours had a RHOA mutation including four hitherto unreported mutations, that is, p.G17Efs*24, p.V24F, p.T37A and p.L69R. RHOA mutation was more prevalent in women (5.4% vs 2.8%), distal GCs (4.5% vs 2.4%), in poorly differentiated GCs (G3/G4; 4.8% vs 1.1%), T1/T2 tumours (6.2% vs 3.1%) and lacked distant metastases. Nine RHOA mutant GCs had a diffuse, four an intestinal, two an unclassified and one a mixed Laurén phenotype. KRAS and RHOA mutations were mutually exclusive. A single case showed both a RHOA and a PIK3CA mutation. No significant difference was found in the overall survival between RHOA mutant and wildtype GCs. Our study confirms the occurrence and clinicopathological characteristics of RHOA hotspot mutations in an independent patient cohort. However, we found no evidence for a prognostic or growth advantageous effect of RHOA mutations in GC.	4
Hypothesis and theory: mechanical instabilities and non-uniformities in hereditary sarcomere myopathies. ||  || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), due to point mutations in genes for sarcomere proteins such as myosin, occurs in 1/500 people and is the most common cause of sudden death in young individuals. Similar mutations in skeletal muscle, e.g., in the MYH7 gene for slow myosin found in both the cardiac ventricle and slow skeletal muscle, may also cause severe disease but the severity and the morphological changes are often different. In HCM, the modified protein function leads, over years to decades, to secondary remodeling with substantial morphological changes, such as hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and extensive fibrosis associated with severe functional deterioration. Despite intense studies, it is unclear how the moderate mutation-induced changes in protein function cause the long-term effects. In hypertrophy of the heart due to pressure overload (e.g., hypertension), mechanical stress in the myocyte is believed to be major initiating stimulus for activation of relevant cell signaling cascades. Here it is considered how expression of mutated proteins, such as myosin or regulatory proteins, could have similar consequences through one or both of the following mechanisms: (1) contractile instabilities within each sarcomere (with more than one stable velocity for a given load), (2) different tension generating capacities of cells in series. These mechanisms would have the potential to cause increased tension and/or stretch of certain cells during parts of the cardiac cycle. Modeling studies are used to illustrate these ideas and experimental tests are proposed. The applicability of similar ideas to skeletal muscle is also postulated, and differences between heart and skeletal muscle are discussed.	4
Genetic risk for malignant hyperthermia in non-anesthesia-induced myopathies. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Anesthesia Case-Control Studies Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Male Malignant Hyperthermia Middle Aged Muscular Diseases Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Risk Factors Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel || Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic, autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of skeletal muscle triggered by volatile anesthetics and infrequently by extreme exertion and heat exposure. MH has variable penetrance with an incidence ranging from 1 in 5000 to 1 in 50,000-100,000 anesthesias. Mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene, RYR1, are found in 50-70% of cases. We hypothesized that a portion of patients with drug-induced muscle diseases, unrelated to anesthesia, such as severe statin myopathy, have underlying genetic liability that may include RYR1 gene mutations. DNA samples were collected from 885 patients in 4 groups: severe statin myopathy (n=197), mild statin myopathy (n=163), statin-tolerant controls (n=133), and non-drug-induced myopathies of unknown etiology characterized by exercise-induced muscle pain and weakness (n=392). Samples were screened for 105 mutations and variants in 26 genes associated with 7 categories of muscle disease including 34 mutations and variants in the RYR1 gene. Disease-causing mutations or variants in RYR1 were present in 3 severe statin myopathy cases, 1 mild statin myopathy case, 8 patients with non-drug-induced myopathy, and none in controls. These results suggest that disease-causing mutations and certain variants in the RYR1 gene may contribute to underlying genetic risk for non-anesthesia-induced myopathies and should be included in genetic susceptibility screening in patients with severe statin myopathy and in patients with non-statin-induced myopathies of unknown etiology.	4
Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor SU9516 increases sensitivity of colorectal carcinoma cells Caco-2 but not HT29 to BH3 mimetic ABT-737. ||  || Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) that represents one of the major causes for cancer-related death in humans is often associated with over-expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family. The aim of presented study was to determine the effect of ABT-737 inhibitor of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w as well as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) inhibitor SU9516 alone and in combination with ABT-737 on survival of colorectal cell lines HT29 and Caco-2. We have shown that both Caco-2 and HT29 cells that are relatively resistant to ABT-737 are also partially sensitive to SU9516, which increased sensitivity of Caco-2 but not HT29 cells to ABT-737. Increased sensitivity of Caco-2 cells to ABT-737 after addition of SU9516 correlated well with SU9516-induced decrease of Mcl-1 expression while we have not observed downregulation of Mcl-1 after the treatment of HT29 cells with SU9516. Instead of this, we have shown that treatment of HT29 cells with SU9516 is associated with decreased expression of tumour suppressor protein p53. Our findings provide a rationale for clinical use of Bcl-2 family inhibitors in combination with CDK2 inhibitors for treatment of Mcl-1-dependent colorectal tumours associated with expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w proteins. In addition, we have shown potential of CDK2 inhibitors for treatment of tumours expressing R273H mutant p53.	0
Characteristics of lung cancers harboring NRAS mutations. || Adenocarcinoma Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Benzimidazoles Cell Line, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Lung Neoplasms Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Pyridones Pyrimidinones ras Proteins || We sought to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer harboring NRAS mutations. We used preclinical models to identify targeted therapies likely to be of benefit against NRAS-mutant lung cancer cells. We reviewed clinical data from patients whose lung cancers were identified at six institutions or reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) to harbor NRAS mutations. Six NRAS-mutant cell lines were screened for sensitivity against inhibitors of multiple kinases (i.e., EGFR, ALK, MET, IGF-1R, BRAF, PI3K, and MEK). Among 4,562 patients with lung cancers tested, NRAS mutations were present in 30 (0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.45%-0.94%); 28 of these had no other driver mutations. 83% had adenocarcinoma histology with no significant differences in gender. While 95% of patients were former or current smokers, smoking-related G:C>T:A transversions were significantly less frequent in NRAS-mutated lung tumors than KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC; NRAS: 13% (4/30), KRAS: 66% (1772/2733), P < 0.00000001]. Five of 6 NRAS-mutant cell lines were sensitive to the MEK inhibitors, selumetinib and trametinib, but not to other inhibitors tested. NRAS mutations define a distinct subset of lung cancers (∼1%) with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Although NRAS mutations are more common in current/former smokers, the types of mutations are not those classically associated with smoking.	4
Multiple gene sequencing for risk assessment in patients with early-onset or familial breast cancer. || Adult Age of Onset Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Female Genes, Tumor Suppressor Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Germ-Line Mutation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Prognosis RNA, Messenger Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Risk Assessment || Since BRCA mutations are only responsible for 10-20% of cases of breast cancer in patients with early-onset or a family history and since next-generation sequencing technology allows the simultaneous sequencing of a large number of target genes, testing for multiple cancer-predisposing genes is now being considered, but its significance in clinical practice remains unclear. We then developed a sequencing panel containing 68 genes that had cancer risk association for patients with early-onset or familial breast cancer. A total of 133 patients were enrolled and 30 (22.6%) were found to carry germline deleterious mutations, 9 in BRCA1, 11 in BRCA2, 2 in RAD50, 2 in TP53 and one each in ATM, BRIP1, FANCI, MSH2, MUTYH, and RAD51C. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was associated with the highest mutation rate (45.5%, p = 0.025). Seven of the 9 BRCA1 mutations and the single FANCI mutation were in the TNBC group; 9 of the 11 BRCA2, 1 of the 2 RAD50 as well as BRIP1, MSH2, MUTYH, and RAD51C mutations were in the hormone receptor (HR)(+)Her2(-) group, and the other RAD50, ATM, and TP53 mutations were in the HR(+)Her2(+) group. Mutation carriers were considered as high-risk to develop malignancy and advised to receive cancer screening. Screening protocols of non-BRCA genes were based on their biologic functions; for example, patients carrying RAD51C mutation received a screening protocol similar to that for BRCA, since BRCA and RAD51C are both involved in homologous recombination. In conclusion, we consider that multiple gene sequencing in cancer risk assessment is clinically valuable.	4
Autism in Phenylketonuria Patients: From Clinical Presentation to Molecular Defects. || Adolescent Age Factors Algeria Autistic Disorder Child Child, Preschool Exons Family Female Gene Frequency Humans Male Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Prognosis Psychiatric Status Rating Scales Tunisia || Autism has been reported in untreated patients with phenylketonuria. The authors aimed to explore autism in 15 Tunisian and 4 Algerian phenylketonuria patients, and report their clinical, biochemical and molecular peculiarities. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised were used for the diagnosis of autism. Five exons of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (7, 6, 10, 11, and 5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced. Among these patients, 15 were suffering from autism at the time of evaluation. Six mutations were identified: p.E280K, p.G352Vfs, IVS10nt11, p.I224T, p.R261Q, and p.R252W. There was no correlation between autism and mutations affecting the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, but the age of diet onset was the determining factor in autistic symptoms' evolution.	3
Structural and functional implications of p53 missense cancer mutations. ||  || Most human cancers contain mutations in the transcription factor p53 and majority of these are missense and located in the DNA binding core domain. In this study, the stabilities of all core domain missense mutations are predicted and are used to infer their likely inactivation mechanisms. Overall, 47.0% non-PRO/GLY mutants are stable (DeltaDeltaG < 1.0 kT) and 36.3% mutants are unstable (DeltaDeltaG > 3.0 kT), 12.2% mutants are with 1.0 kT < DeltaDeltaG < 3.0 kT. Only 4.5% mutants are with no conclusive predictions. Certain types of either stable or unstable mutations are found not to depend on their local structures. Y, I, C, V, F and W (W, R and F) are the most common residues before (after) mutation in unstable mutants. Q, N, K, D, A, S and T (I, T, L and V) are the most common residues before (after) mutation in stable mutants. The stability correlations with sequence, structure, and molecular contacts are also analyzed. No direct correlation between secondary structure and stability is apparent, but a strong correlation between solvent exposure and stability is noticeable. Our correlation analysis shows that loss of protein-protein contacts may be an alternative cause for p53 inactivation. Correlation with clinical data shows that loss of stability and loss of DNA contacts are the two main inactivation mechanisms. Finally, correlation with functional data shows that most mutations which retain functions are stable, and most mutations that gain functions are unstable, indicating destabilized and deformed p53 proteins are more likely to find new binding partners.PACS codes: 87.14.E-	0
Mutant TP53 G245C and R273H promote cellular malignancy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 DNA Mutational Analysis Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53 gene mutations occur in more than 50% of human cancers and the vast majority of these mutations in human cancers are missense mutations, which broadly occur in DNA binding domain (DBD) (Amino acids 102-292) and mainly reside in six "hotspot" residues. TP53 G245C and R273H point mutations are two of the most frequent mutations in tumors and have been verified in several different cancers. In the previous study of the whole genome sequencing (WGS), we found some mutations of TP53 DBD in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) clinical samples. We focused on two high-frequent mutations TP53 p.G245C and TP53 p.R273H and investigated their oncogenic roles in ESCC cell lines, p53-defective cell lines H1299 and HCT116 p53-/-. MTS and colony formation assays showed that mutant TP53 G245C and R273H increased cell vitality and proliferation. Flow cytometry results revealed inhibition of ultraviolet radiation (UV)- and ionizing radiation (IR)- induced apoptosis and disruption of TP53-mediated cell cycle arrest after UV, IR and Nocodazole treatment. Transwell assays indicated that mutant TP53 G245C and R273H enhanced cell migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, western blot revealed that they were able to suppress the expression of TP53 downstream genes in the process of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by UV, which suggests that these two mutations can influence apoptosis and growth arrest might be due, at least in part, to down-regulate the expression of P21, GADD45α and PARP. These results indicate that mutant TP53 G245C and R273H can lead to more aggressive phenotypes and enhance cancer cell malignancy, which further uncover TP53 function in carcinogenesis and might be useful in clinical diagnosis and therapy of TP53 mutant cancers.	0
Targeted next-generation sequencing of deafness genes in hearing-impaired individuals uncovers informative mutations. || Adolescent Adult Audiometry Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Deafness Family Health Female Gene Deletion Gene Dosage Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Homozygote Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Pedigree Sequence Analysis, DNA Treatment Outcome Young Adult || Targeted next-generation sequencing provides a remarkable opportunity to identify variants in known disease genes, particularly in extremely heterogeneous disorders such as nonsyndromic hearing loss. The present study attempts to shed light on the complexity of hearing impairment. Using one of two next-generation sequencing panels containing either 80 or 129 deafness genes, we screened 30 individuals with nonsyndromic hearing loss (from 23 unrelated families) and analyzed 9 normal-hearing controls. Overall, we found an average of 3.7 variants (in 80 genes) with deleterious prediction outcome, including a number of novel variants, in individuals with nonsyndromic hearing loss and 1.4 in controls. By next-generation sequencing alone, 12 of 23 (52%) probands were diagnosed with monogenic forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss; one individual displayed a DNA sequence mutation together with a microdeletion. Two (9%) probands have Usher syndrome. In the undiagnosed individuals (10/23; 43%) we detected a significant enrichment of potentially pathogenic variants as compared to controls. Next-generation sequencing combined with microarrays provides the diagnosis for approximately half of the GJB2 mutation-negative individuals. Usher syndrome was found to be more frequent in the study cohort than anticipated. The conditions in a proportion of individuals with nonsyndromic hearing loss, particularly in the undiagnosed group, may have been caused or modified by an accumulation of unfavorable variants across multiple genes.	4
Δ40p53α suppresses tumor cell proliferation and induces cellular senescence in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. || Base Sequence Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Proliferation Cellular Senescence Clone Cells G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Gene Deletion Gene Knockdown Techniques Hep G2 Cells Humans Liver Neoplasms Models, Biological Mutant Proteins Phenotype Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Splice variants of certain genes impact on genetic biodiversity in mammals. The tumor suppressor TP53 gene (encoding p53) plays an important role in the regulation of tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Δ40p53α is a naturally occurring p53 isoform that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain, yet little is known about the role of Δ40p53α in the development of HCC. Here, we first report on the role of Δ40p53α in HCC cell lines. In the TP53+/Δ40 cell clones, clonogenic activity and cell survival dramatically decreased, whereas the percentage of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive cells and p21 (also known as WAF1, CIP1 and CDKN1A) expression significantly increased. These observations were clearly attenuated in the TP53+/Δ40 cell clones after Δ40p53α knockdown. In addition, exogenous Δ40p53 expression significantly suppressed cell growth in HCC cells with wild-type TP53, and in those that were mutant or null for TP53 Notably, Δ40p53α-induced tumor suppressor activity was markedly attenuated in cells expressing the hot-spot mutant Δ40p53α-R175H, which lacks the transcription factor activity of p53. Moreover, Δ40p53α expression was associated with increased full-length p53 protein expression. These findings enhance the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC and show that Δ40p53α acts as an important tumor suppressor in HCC cells.	0
Novel connexin 30 and connexin 26 mutational spectrum in patients with progressive sensorineural hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation || Mutations in the gap junction protein beta-2 gene ('GJB2') are known to be responsible for mild to profound congenital and late-onset hearing loss. This study aimed to investigate the molecular basis of progressive hearing loss compared with non-progressive hearing loss. Following clinical otorhinolaryngological evaluation, a genetic analysis was performed in a cohort of 72 patients with progressive sensorineural hearing loss. Pathological genotypes were established in 16 patients (22.2 per cent). Six different gap junction protein beta-2 gene mutations were detected in 15 patients, with the c.35delG mutation responsible for 56 per cent of the mutated alleles. A novel gap junction protein beta-6 gene ('GJB6') mutation (p.Met203Val) was observed in one patient with mild progressive hearing loss. Analyses of gap junction protein beta-2 and -6 genes revealed that similar pathological genotypes, occurring with similar frequencies, were responsible for progressive hearing loss, compared with reported genotypes for non-progressive hearing loss patients. Thus, genotype cannot be used to differentiate non-progressive from progressive hearing loss cases; in this study, patients both with and without an established pathological genotype had a similar clinical course.	4
Targeting of the MAPK and AKT pathways in conjunctival melanoma shows potential synergy. || AKT MAPK conjunctival melanoma kinase inhibitor nevus || Conjunctival melanoma (CM) is a rare but lethal form of cancer. Similar to cutaneous melanoma, CM frequently carries activating mutations in <i>BRAF</i> and <i>NRAS</i>. We studied whether CM as well as conjunctival benign and premalignant melanocytic lesions express targets in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways, and whether specific inhibitors can suppress CM growth <i>in vitro</i>. 131 conjunctival lesions obtained from 129 patients were collected. The presence of <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation and expression of phosphorylated (p)-ERK and p-AKT were assessed by immunohistochemistry. We studied cell proliferation, phosphorylation, cell cycling and apoptosis in three CM cell lines using two BRAF inhibitors (Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib), a MEK inhibitor (MEK162) and an AKT inhibitor (MK2206). The <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation was present in 19% of nevi and 26% of melanomas, but not in primary acquired melanosis (PAM). Nuclear and cytoplasmic p-ERK and p-AKT were expressed in all conjunctival lesions. Both BRAF inhibitors suppressed growth of both <i>BRAF</i> mutant CM cell lines, but only one induced cell death. MEK162 and MK2206 inhibited proliferation of CM cells in a dose-dependent manner, and the combination of these two drugs led to synergistic growth inhibition and cell death in all CM cell lines. ERK and AKT are constitutively activated in conjunctival nevi, PAM and melanoma. While BRAF inhibitors prohibited cell growth, they were not always cytotoxic. Combining MEK and AKT inhibitors led to more growth inhibition and cell death in CM cells. The combination may benefit patients suffering from metastatic conjunctival melanoma.	0
Patient and observer reported outcome measures to evaluate health-related quality of life in inherited metabolic diseases: a scoping review. ||  || Health-related Quality of Life (HrQoL) is a multidimensional measure, which has gained clinical and social relevance. Implementation of a patient-centred approach to both clinical research and care settings, has increased the recognition of patient and/or observer reported outcome measures (PROMs or ObsROMs) as informative and reliable tools for HrQoL assessment. Inherited Metabolic Diseases (IMDs) are a group of heterogeneous conditions with phenotypes ranging from mild to severe and mostly lacking effective therapies. Consequently, HrQoL evaluation is particularly relevant. We aimed to: (1) identify patient and/or caregiver-reported HrQoL instruments used among IMDs; (2) identify the main results of the application of each HrQoL tool and (3) evaluate the main limitations of HrQoL instruments and study design/methodology in IMDs. A scoping review was conducted using methods outlined by Arksey and O'Malley. Additionally, we critically analysed each article to identify the HrQoL study drawbacks. Of the 1954 studies identified, 131 addressed HrQoL of IMDs patients using PROMs and/or ObsROMs, both in observational or interventional studies. In total, we identified 32 HrQoL instruments destined to self- or proxy-completion; only 2% were disease-specific. Multiple tools (both generic and disease-specific) proved to be responsive to changes in HrQoL; the SF-36 and PedsQL questionnaires were the most frequently used in the adult and pediatric populations, respectively. Furthermore, proxy data often demonstrated to be a reliable approach complementing self-reported HrQoL scores. Nevertheless, numerous limitations were identified especially due to the rarity of these conditions. HrQoL is still not frequently assessed in IMDs. However, our results show successful examples of the use of patient-reported HrQoL instruments in this field. The importance of HrQoL measurement for clinical research and therapy development, incites to further research in HrQoL PROMs' and ObsROMs' creation and validation in IMDs.	4

The aim of this study was to shed more light on the mutational spectrum of pediatric AF, comparing it with its adult counterpart, with a view to identifying biomarkers for use as prognostic factors or new potential therapeutic targets. CTNNB1, APC, AKT1, BRAF TP53, and RET Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) with the 50-gene Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 were performed on formalin-fixed samples from 28 pediatric and 33 adult AFs. The prognostic value of CTNNB1, AKT1, and BRAF mutations in pediatric AF patients was investigated. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and statistical comparisons were drawn using the log-rank test. In addition to the CTNNB1 mutation (64%), pediatric AF showed AKT1 (31%), BRAF (19%), and TP53 (9%) mutations, whereas only the CTNNB1 mutation was found in adult AF. The polymorphism Q472H VEGFR was identified in both pediatric (56%) and adult (40%) AF. Our results indicate that the mutational spectrum of pediatric AF is more complex than that of adult AF, with multiple gene mutations involving not only CTNNB1 but also AKT1 and BRAF. This intriguing finding may have clinical implications and warrants further investigations.	4
Unravelling the Complexity of Inherited Retinal Dystrophies Molecular Testing: Added Value of Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Eye Proteins Female Genetic Counseling Genotype High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pathology, Molecular Pedigree Retinal Dystrophies Retinitis Pigmentosa Young Adult || To assess the clinical utility of targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for the diagnosis of Inherited Retinal Dystrophies (IRDs), a total of 109 subjects were enrolled in the study, including 88 IRD affected probands and 21 healthy relatives. Clinical diagnoses included Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), Stargardt Disease (STGD), Best Macular Dystrophy (BMD), Usher Syndrome (USH), and other IRDs with undefined clinical diagnosis. Participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination followed by genetic counseling. A custom AmpliSeq™ panel of 72 IRD-related genes was designed for the analysis and tested using Ion semiconductor Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Potential disease-causing mutations were identified in 59.1% of probands, comprising mutations in 16 genes. The highest diagnostic yields were achieved for BMD, LCA, USH, and STGD patients, whereas RP confirmed its high genetic heterogeneity. Causative mutations were identified in 17.6% of probands with undefined diagnosis. Revision of the initial diagnosis was performed for 9.6% of genetically diagnosed patients. This study demonstrates that NGS represents a comprehensive cost-effective approach for IRDs molecular diagnosis. The identification of the genetic alterations underlying the phenotype enabled the clinicians to achieve a more accurate diagnosis. The results emphasize the importance of molecular diagnosis coupled with clinic information to unravel the extensive phenotypic heterogeneity of these diseases.	4
Enzyme activities of α-glucosidase in Japanese neonates with pseudodeficiency alleles. ||  || Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are caused by defective enzyme activities in lysosomes, characterized by the accumulation of sphingolipids, glycolipids, oligosaccharides, mucopolysaccharides, the oxidation products of cholesterol, and other biological substances. A growing number of clinical studies have suggested the enhanced efficacy of existing therapies, including enzyme replacement therapy, which is effective when it is initiated during the presymptomatic period. Thus, the identification of disease-affected individuals by newborn screening has been considered an effective platform. Previous studies have suggested that the discrimination of infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) requires multi-step examination of GAA enzyme activity using the fluorometric technique. In sharp contrast, the MS/MS-based technique can identify the population of IOPD and the pseudodeficiency alleles of the GAA enzyme [Liao HC et al. Clin Chem (2017) in press; doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2016.269027]. To determine whether MS/MS-based assay can identify these two populations in Japanese neonates, we first performed a validation study of this assay using flow-injection analysis (FIA)-MS/MS and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS followed by examination of GAA enzyme activity in our population. By minimizing the effect of substrate-derived in-source decomposition products, the activities of 6 LSD enzymes were quantified in FIA-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS. The mean value of GAA activity with IOPD, pseudodeficiency alleles, and healthy controls by FIA-MS/MS were 1.0 ± 0.3 μmol/h/L (max, 1.3; min, 0.7; median, 1.2; n = 3), 2.7 ± 0.7 μmol/h/L (max, 4.5; min, 1.5; median, 2.5;n = 19), and 12.9 ± 5.4 μmol/h/L (max, 29.6; min, 2.5; median, 11.0;n = 83), respectively. These results suggest that the population of GAA with pseudodeficiency alleles has approximately 20% of GAA enzyme activity compared to controls, providing the preliminary evidence to estimate the cut-off values in the Japanese population using this technique.	1
Whole-genome sequencing of bladder cancers reveals somatic CDKN1A mutations and clinicopathological associations with mutation burden. || Base Sequence Cadherins Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Genetic Variation Genome Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Neoplasm Grading Sequence Analysis, DNA Urinary Bladder Neoplasms || Bladder cancers are a leading cause of death from malignancy. Molecular markers might predict disease progression and behaviour more accurately than the available prognostic factors. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to identify somatic mutations and chromosomal changes in 14 bladder cancers of different grades and stages. As well as detecting the known bladder cancer driver mutations, we report the identification of recurrent protein-inactivating mutations in CDKN1A and FAT1. The former are not mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations or MDM2 amplification, showing that CDKN1A dysfunction is not simply an alternative mechanism for p53 pathway inactivation. We find strong positive associations between higher tumour stage/grade and greater clonal diversity, the number of somatic mutations and the burden of copy number changes. In principle, the identification of sub-clones with greater diversity and/or mutation burden within early-stage or low-grade tumours could identify lesions with a high risk of invasive progression.	4
Modeling of miRNA and drug action in the EGFR signaling pathway. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Computer Simulation ErbB Receptors Humans Kinetics MicroRNAs Models, Biological Signal Transduction || MicroRNAs have gained significant interest due to their widespread occurrence and diverse functions as regulatory molecules, which are essential for cell division, growth, development and apoptosis in eukaryotes. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is one of the best investigated cellular signaling pathways regulating important cellular processes and its deregulation is associated with severe diseases, such as cancer. In this study, we introduce a systems biological model of the EGFR signaling pathway integrating validated miRNA-target information according to diverse studies, in order to demonstrate essential roles of miRNA within this pathway. The model consists of 1241 reactions and contains 241 miRNAs. We analyze the impact of 100 specific miRNA inhibitors (anit-miRNAs) on this pathway and propose that the embedded miRNA-network can help to identify new drug targets of the EGFR signaling pathway and thereby support the development of new therapeutic strategies against cancer.	0
Morphologic and molecular study of lung cancers associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other pulmonary fibroses. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Female Humans Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Pulmonary Fibrosis Retrospective Studies || Primitive lung cancers developed on lung fibroses are both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Their incidence may increase with new more efficient lung fibrosis treatments. Our aim was to describe a cohort of lung cancers associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other lung fibrotic disorders (non-IPF), and to characterize their molecular alterations using immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-one cancer samples were collected from 2001 to 2016 in two French reference centers for pulmonary fibrosis - 18 for IPF group and 13 for non-IPF group. NGS was performed using an ampliseq panel to analyze hotspots and targeted regions in 22 cancer-associated genes. ALK, ROS1 and PD-L1 expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent histologic subtype in the IPF group (44%), adenocarcinoma was the most frequent subtype in the non-IPF group (62%). Forty-one mutations in 13 genes and one EGFR amplification were identified in 25 samples. Two samples had no mutation in the selected panel. Mutations were identified in TP53 (n = 20), MET (n = 4), BRAF (n = 3), FGFR3, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11 (n = 2), SMAD4, CTNNB1, DDR2, ERBB4, FBXW7 and KRAS (n = 1) genes. No ALK and ROS1 expressions were identified. PD-L1 was expressed in 10 cases (62%) with only one (6%) case >50%. This extensive characterization of lung fibrosis-associated cancers evidenced molecular alterations which could represent either potential therapeutic targets either clues to the pathophysiology of these particular tumors. These findings support the relevance of large molecular characterization of every lung fibrosis-associated cancer.	4

Small molecule inhibitors of RAS-effector protein interactions derived using an intracellular antibody fragment. || Antibodies Binding Sites, Antibody Biomarkers Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Crystallography, X-Ray HEK293 Cells Humans Immunoglobulin Fragments Mutation Protein Binding Protein Domains Recombinant Proteins Signal Transduction Small Molecule Libraries Surface Plasmon Resonance ras Proteins || Targeting specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is an attractive concept for drug development, but hard to implement since intracellular antibodies do not penetrate cells and most small-molecule drugs are considered unsuitable for PPI inhibition. A potential solution to these problems is to select intracellular antibody fragments to block PPIs, use these antibody fragments for target validation in disease models and finally derive small molecules overlapping the antibody-binding site. Here, we explore this strategy using an anti-mutant RAS antibody fragment as a competitor in a small-molecule library screen for identifying RAS-binding compounds. The initial hits are optimized by structure-based design, resulting in potent RAS-binding compounds that interact with RAS inside the cells, prevent RAS-effector interactions and inhibit endogenous RAS-dependent signalling. Our results may aid RAS-dependent cancer drug development and demonstrate a general concept for developing small compounds to replace intracellular antibody fragments, enabling rational drug development to target validated PPIs.	0
Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutations in melanoma frequently co-occur with NRAS mutations. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Skin Neoplasms || Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is a metabolic enzyme that converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. IDH1 mutations are associated with the accumulation of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which acts as an epigenetic modifier, and the development of multiple malignancies. From May 2013 to June 2017, 252 melanoma samples from 214 patients with advanced or distant metastatic disease were tested for somatic mutations with the 50-gene AmpliSeq version 2 Cancer Hotspot Panel. Two hundred and twenty-six samples were sequenced successfully from 206 patients with 26 samples being characterised as quantity not sufficient. Melanomas from 10 separate patients (4.9%) were positive for IDH1 R132C (nine) or R132S (one). In six cases, the tumours also had a co-existing NRAS mutation (p.Q61R, Q61L and Q61K in two patients each) (P = 0.0044), whereas three patients had BRAF non-V600E mutations (V600K, V600G and V600R). Two cases had a TP53 variant, two cases an ATM variant, one a CDKN2A variant and one had an APC variant. The patients' ages ranged from 45 to 82 years (mean = 65.3, median = 65 years) and three of 10 patients were female (M:F ratio = 2:3). Three patients were stage 3 and seven were stage 4. Two are deceased, five are alive with stable disease (four on pembrolizumab) and three have no evidence of disease. IDH mutations may define a unique subset of melanoma patients who are eligible for IDH1 targeted therapies or combined therapies, such as MEK inhibitors when there is co-existing NRAS mutations, or immunotherapy.	4
Contribution of the PALB2 c.2323C>T [p.Q775X] founder mutation in well-defined breast and/or ovarian cancer families and unselected ovarian cancer cases of French Canadian descent. || Adult Aged Base Sequence Breast Neoplasms Canada European Continental Ancestry Group Family Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Female Founder Effect Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Heterozygote Humans Middle Aged Nuclear Proteins Ovarian Neoplasms Pedigree Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The PALB2 c.2323C>T [p.Q775X] mutation has been reported in at least three breast cancer families and breast cancer cases of French Canadian descent and this has been attributed to common ancestors. The number of mutation-positive cases reported varied based on criteria of ascertainment of index cases tested. Although inherited PALB2 mutations are associated with increased risks of developing breast cancer, risk to ovarian cancer has not been fully explored in this demographically unique population. We screened the PALB2 p.Q775X variant in 71 families with at least three cases of breast cancer (n=48) or breast and ovarian cancers (n=23) that have previously been found negative for at least the most common BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations reported in the French Canadian population and in 491 women of French Canadian descent who had invasive ovarian cancer and/or low malignant potential tumors of the major histopathological subtypes. We identified a PALB2 p.Q775X carrier in a breast cancer family, who had invasive ductal breast carcinomas at 39 and 42 years of age. We also identified a PALB2 p.Q775X carrier who had papillary serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma at age 58 among the 238 serous subtype ovarian cancer cases investigated, who also had breast cancer at age 52. Our findings, taken together with previous reports, support adding PALB2 c.2323C>T p.Q775X to the list of cancer susceptibility genes for which founder mutations have been identified in the French Canadian population.	4
Unilateral and bilateral expression of a quantitative trait: asymmetry and symmetry in coronal craniosynostosis. || Child Craniosynostoses Female Humans Male Skull Tomography, X-Ray Computed || Bilateral symmetry in vertebrates is imperfect and mild asymmetries are found in normal growth and development. However, abnormal development is often characterized by strong asymmetries. Coronal craniosynostosis, defined here as consisting of premature suture closure and a characteristic skull shape, is a complex trait. The premature fusion of the coronal suture can occur unilaterally associated with skull asymmetry (anterior plagiocephaly) or bilaterally associated with a symmetric but brachycephalic skull. We investigated the relationship between coronal craniosynostosis and skull bilateral symmetry. Three-dimensional landmark coordinates were recorded on preoperative computed tomography images of children diagnosed with coronal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (N = 40) and that of unaffected individuals (N = 20) and analyzed by geometric morphometrics. Our results showed that the fusion pattern of the coronal suture is similar across individuals and types of coronal craniosynostosis. Shape analysis showed that skulls of bilateral coronal craniosynostosis (BCS) and unaffected individuals display low degrees of asymmetry, whereas right and left unilateral coronal craniosynostosis (UCS) skulls are asymmetric and mirror images of one another. When premature fusion of the coronal suture (without taking into account cranial dysmorphology) is scored as a qualitative trait, the expected relationship between trait frequency and trait unilateral expression (i.e. negative correlation) is confirmed. Overall, we interpret our results as evidence that the same biological processes operate on the two sides in BCS skulls and on the affected side in UCS skulls, and that coronal craniosynostosis is a quantitative trait exhibiting a phenotypic continuum with BCS displaying more intense shape changes than UCS.	4
Genomic markers of panitumumab resistance including ERBB2/ HER2 in a phase II study of KRAS wild-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). || Aged Antibodies, Monoclonal Antineoplastic Agents Colorectal Neoplasms Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Genomics Humans Male Panitumumab Prospective Studies Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Receptor, ErbB-2 || A prospective study was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with resistance to panitumumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients with previously treated, codon 12/13 KRAS wt, mCRC were prospectively administered panitumumab 6 mg/kg IV q2weeks. Of 34 panitumumab-treated patients, 11 (32%) had progressive disease at 8 weeks and were classified as non-responders. A Nanostring nCounter-based assay identified a 5-gene expression signature (ERBB2, MLPH, IRX3, MYRF, and KLK6) associated with panitumumab resistance (P = 0.001). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization determined that the HER2 (ERBB2) protein was overexpressed in 4/11 non-responding and 0/21 responding cases (P = 0.035). Two non-responding tumors had ERBB2 gene amplification only, and one demonstrated both ERBB2 amplification and mutation. A non-codon 12/13 KRAS mutation occurred in one panitumumab-resistant patient and was mutually exclusive with ERBB2/HER2 abnormalities. This study identifies a 5-gene signature associated with non-response to single agent panitumumab, including a subgroup of non-responders with evidence of aberrant ERBB2/HER2 signaling. KRAS wt tumors resistant to EGFRi may be identified by gene signature analysis, and the HER2 pathway plays an important role in resistance to therapy.	4
The Relationship between TP53 Gene Status and Carboxylesterase 2 Expression in Human Colorectal Cancer. || Carboxylesterase Cell Line, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms Down-Regulation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells Humans Mutation Sequence Analysis, DNA Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Irinotecan (CPT-11) is an anticancer prodrug that is activated by the carboxylesterase CES2 and has been approved for the treatment of many types of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. Recent studies with cell lines show that CES2 expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53. However, clinical evidence for this regulatory mechanism in cancer is lacking. In this study, we examined the relationship between TP53 gene status and CES2 expression in human colorectal cancer. Most colorectal cancer specimens (70%; 26 of 37) showed lower CES2 mRNA levels (≥1.5-fold lower) than the adjacent normal tissue, and only 30% (12 of 37) showed similar (<1.5-fold lower) or higher CES2 mRNA levels. However,TP53 gene sequencing revealed no relationship between CES2 downregulation andTP53 mutational status. Moreover, while colorectal cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 exhibited p53-dependent upregulation of CES2, PRIMA-1MET, a drug that restores the transcriptional activity of mutant p53, failed to upregulate CES2 expression in cells withTP53 missense mutations. These results, taken together, suggest that CES2 mRNA expression is decreased in human colorectal cancer independently of p53.	0
Mutant p53 regulates Dicer through p63-dependent and -independent mechanisms to promote an invasive phenotype. || Cell Line, Tumor DEAD-box RNA Helicases Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasms Ribonuclease III Transcription Factors Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The control and processing of microRNAs (miRs) is critical in the regulation of all cellular responses. Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in the expression of certain miRs, or an overall decrease in miR processing through the partial depletion of Dicer, can promote enhanced metastatic potential. We show here that Dicer depletion can promote the invasive behavior of cells that is reflected in enhanced recycling and activation of the growth factor receptors Met and EGF receptor. These responses are also seen in response to the expression of tumor-derived mutant p53s, and we show that mutant p53 can down-regulate Dicer expression through both direct inhibition of the TAp63-mediated transcriptional activation of Dicer and a TAp63-independent control of Dicer protein expression. Our results delineate a clear relationship between mutant p53, TAp63, and Dicer that might contribute to the metastatic function of mutant p53 but, interestingly, also reveal TAp63-independent functions of mutant p53 in controlling Dicer activity.	0
Clinical, pathological, and molecular analyses of cardiovascular abnormalities in Costello syndrome: a Ras/MAPK pathway syndrome. || Adolescent Adult Cardiovascular Abnormalities Child Child, Preschool Costello Syndrome Female Genetic Association Studies Humans Infant Infant, Newborn MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Postmortem Changes Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Young Adult ras Proteins || Cardiovascular abnormalities are important features of Costello syndrome and other Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes ("RASopathies"). We conducted clinical, pathological and molecular analyses of 146 patients with an HRAS mutation including 61 enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study and 85 from the literature. In our study, the most common (84%) HRAS mutation was p.G12S. A congenital heart defect (CHD) was present in 27 of 61 patients (44%), usually non-progressive valvar pulmonary stenosis. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), typically subaortic septal hypertrophy, was noted in 37 (61%), and 5 also had a CHD (14% of those with HCM). HCM was chronic or progressive in 14 (37%), stabilized in 10 (27%), and resolved in 5 (15%) patients with HCM; follow-up data was not available in 8 (22%). Atrial tachycardia occurred in 29 (48%). Valvar pulmonary stenosis rarely progressed and atrial septal defect was uncommon. Among those with HCM, the likelihood of progressing or remaining stable was similar (37%, 41% respectively). The observation of myocardial fiber disarray in 7 of 10 (70%) genotyped specimens with Costello syndrome is consistent with sarcomeric dysfunction. Multifocal atrial tachycardia may be distinctive for Costello syndrome. Potentially serious atrial tachycardia may present in the fetus, and may continue or worsen in about one-fourth of those with arrhythmia, but is generally self-limited in the remaining three-fourths of patients. Physicians should be aware of the potential for rapid development of severe HCM in infants with Costello syndrome, and the need for cardiovascular surveillance into adulthood as the natural history continues to be delineated.	4
Premature calvarial synostosis and epidermal hyperplasia (Beare-Stevenson syndrome-like anomalies) resulting from a P250R missense mutation in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. || Amino Acid Substitution Craniosynostoses DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Hyperplasia Infant Mutation, Missense Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor Skin Skin Diseases || We report on a patient with a severe premature calvarial synostosis and epidermal hyperplasia. The phenotype was consistent with that of a mild presentation of Beare-Stevenson syndrome but molecular analysis of the IgIII-transmembrane linker region and the transmembrane domain of the gene encoding the FGFR2 receptor, revealed wild-type sequence only. Subsequently, molecular analysis of the FGFR3 receptor gene identified a heterozygous P250R missense mutation in both the proposita and her mildly affected father. This communication extends the clinical spectrum of the FGFR3 P250R mutation to encompass epidermal hyperplasia and documents the phenomenon of activated FGFR receptors stimulating common downstream developmental pathways, resulting in overlapping clinical outcomes.	4
[Results of molecular genetic testing in Russian patients with Pendred syndrome and allelic disorders]. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Connexins Exons Female Goiter, Nodular Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Point Mutation Russia Sulfate Transporters || Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by a combination of sensorineural hearing impairment and euthyroid goiter; its clinical manifestation in children is hardly distinguishable from nonsyndromic hearing loss. Pendred syndrome is one of the most frequent types of syndromic hearing loss. Hearing impairment is accompanied by abnormal development of the bony labyrinth—enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and occasionally combined with Mondini dysplasia. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, which encodes the pendrin protein, are responsible for both Pendred syndrome and for allelic disorder (nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct). The present study for the first time conducted molecular genetic analysis in 20 Russian patients with Pendred syndrome, EVA and/or Mondini dysplasia. As a result, six pathogenic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene were revealed in four patients. The mutation c.222G>T (p.Trp74Cys) was detected for the first time. Mutations were found in patients with Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic EVA with or without Mondini dysplasia. Mutations were not detected in patients with isolated Mondini dysplasia. One proband with clinical diagnosis Pendred syndrome was homozygous for the c.35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene. The absence of frequent mutations, including well-known ones or “hot” exons in the SLC26A4 gene, was reported. Therefore, the optimal method to search for mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in Russian patients is Sanger sequencing of all exons and exon-intron boundaries in the SLC26A4 gene.	1
Somatic sequence alterations in twenty-one genes selected by expression profile analysis of breast carcinomas. || Breast Neoplasms Carcinoma Conserved Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Female Gene Expression Profiling Humans || Genomic alterations have been observed in breast carcinomas that affect the capacity of cells to regulate proliferation, signaling, and metastasis. Re-sequence studies have investigated candidate genes based on prior genetic observations (changes in copy number or regions of genetic instability) or other laboratory observations and have defined critical somatic mutations in genes such as TP53 and PIK3CA. We have extended the paradigm and analyzed 21 genes primarily identified by expression profiling studies, which are useful for breast cancer subtyping and prognosis. This study conducted a bidirectional re-sequence analysis of all exons and 5', 3', and evolutionarily conserved regions (spanning more than 16 megabases) in 91 breast tumor samples. Eighty-seven unique somatic alterations were identified in 16 genes. Seventy-eight were single base pair alterations, of which 23 were missense mutations; 55 were distributed across conserved intronic regions or the 5' and 3' regions. There were nine insertion/deletions. Because there is no a priori way to predict whether any one of the identified synonymous and noncoding somatic alterations disrupt function, analysis unique to each gene will be required to establish whether it is a tumor suppressor gene or whether there is no effect. In five genes, no somatic alterations were observed. The study confirms the value of re-sequence analysis in cancer gene discovery and underscores the importance of characterizing somatic alterations across genes that are related not only by function, or functional pathways, but also based upon expression patterns.	4
Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B differentially affects thyroid cancer cell growth, apoptosis, and invasion. || Apoptosis Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Enzyme Inhibitors Humans NF-kappa B Neoplasm Invasiveness Nitriles Oleanolic Acid Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Signal Transduction Sulfones Thyroid Neoplasms || Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a key role in promoting cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Our understanding of NF-kappaB signaling in thyroid cancer, however, is limited. In this study, we have investigated the role of NF-kappaB signaling in thyroid cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis using selective genetic inhibition of NF-kappaB in advanced thyroid cancer cell lines. Three pharmacologic inhibitors of NF-kappaB differentially inhibited growth in a panel of advanced thyroid cancer cell lines, suggesting that these NF-kappaB inhibitors may have off-target effects. We therefore used a selective genetic approach to inhibit NF-kappaB signaling by overexpression of a dominant-negative IkappaBalpha (mIkappaBalpha). These studies revealed decreased cell growth in only one of five thyroid cancer cell lines (8505C), which occurred through a block in the S-G2/M transition. Resistance to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis was observed in all cell lines, likely through an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by mIkappaBalpha sensitized a subset of cell lines to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. Sensitive cell lines displayed sustained activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, defining a potential mechanism of response. Finally, NF-kappaB inhibition by mIkappaBalpha expression differentially reduced thyroid cancer cell invasion in these thyroid cancer cell lines. Sensitive cell lines demonstrated approximately a two-fold decrease in invasion, which was associated with differential expression of MMP-13. MMP-9 was reduced by mIkappaBalpha expression in all cell lines tested. These data indicate that selective inhibition of NF-kappaB represents an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced thyroid. However, it is apparent that global regulation of thyroid cancer cell growth and invasion is not achieved by NF-kappaB signaling alone. Instead, our findings suggest that other important molecular processes play a critical role in defining the extent of NF-kappaB function within cancer cells.	0
Multi-Center Evaluation of the Fully Automated PCR-Based Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Assay for Rapid KRAS Mutation Status Determination on Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue of Human Colorectal Cancer. ||  || Since the advent of monoclonal antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colorectal cancer therapy, the determination of RAS mutational status is needed for therapeutic decision-making. Most prevalent in colorectal cancer are KRAS exon 2 mutations (40% prevalence); lower prevalence is observed for KRAS exon 3 and 4 mutations (6%) and NRAS exon 2, 3, and 4 mutations (5%). The Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Test on the molecular diagnostics Idylla™ platform is a simple (<2 minutes hands-on time), highly reliable, and rapid (approximately 2 hours turnaround time) in vitro diagnostic sample-to-result solution. This test enables qualitative detection of 21 mutations in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, and 146 of the KRAS oncogene being clinically relevant according to the latest clinical guidelines. Here, the performance of the Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Assay, for Research Use Only, was assessed on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections by comparing its results with the results previously obtained by routine reference approaches for KRAS genotyping. In case of discordance, samples were assessed further by additional methods. Among the 374 colorectal cancer FFPE samples tested, the overall concordance between the Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Assay and the confirmed reference routine test results was found to be 98.9%. The Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Assay enabled detection of 5 additional KRAS-mutated samples not detected previously with reference methods. As conclusion the Idylla™ KRAS Mutation Test can be applied as routine tool in any clinical setting, without needing molecular infrastructure or expertise, to guide the personalized treatment of colorectal cancer patients.	4
The influence of p53 mutation status on the anti-cancer effect of cisplatin in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. ||  || The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of cisplatin by studying its effects on cell viability and identifying the mechanisms underlying the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines with varying p53 mutation status. Three OSCC cell lines, YD-8 (p53 point mutation), YD-9 (p53 wild type), and YD-38 (p53 deletion) were used. To determine the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, MTS assay was performed. The cell cycle alteration and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of cell cycle alteration- or apoptosis-related proteins as well as p53. Cisplatin showed a time- and dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect in all cell lines. Cisplatin induced G2/M cell accumulation in the three cell lines after treatment with 0.5 and 1.0 µg/mL of cisplatin for 48 hours. The proportion of annexin V-FITC-stained cells increased following treatment with cisplatin. The apoptotic proportion was lower in the YD-38 cell line than in the YD-9 or YD-8 cell lines. Also, immunoblotting analysis indicated that p53 and p21 were detected only in YD-8 and YD-9 cell lines after cisplatin treatment. In this study, cisplatin showed anti-cancer effects via G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis, with some difference among OSCC cell lines. The mutation status of p53 might have influenced the difference observed among cell lines. Further studies on p53 mutation status are needed to understand the biological behavior and characteristics of OSCCs and to establish appropriate treatment.	0
Genetic advances in craniosynostosis. || Congenital Abnormalities Cranial Sutures Craniosynostoses Humans Ossification, Heterotopic Phenotype || Craniosynostosis, the premature ossification of one or more skull sutures, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous congenital anomaly affecting approximately one in 2,500 live births. In most cases, it occurs as an isolated congenital anomaly, that is, nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NCS), the genetic, and environmental causes of which remain largely unknown. Recent data suggest that, at least some of the midline NCS cases may be explained by two loci inheritance. In approximately 25-30% of patients, craniosynostosis presents as a feature of a genetic syndrome due to chromosomal defects or mutations in genes within interconnected signaling pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a detailed and comprehensive update on the genetic and environmental factors associated with NCS, integrating the scientific findings achieved during the last decade. Focus on the neurodevelopmental, imaging, and treatment aspects of NCS is also provided.	4
Founder mutations in the Netherlands: geographical distribution of the most prevalent mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein B genes. ||  || BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, a screening programme was set up in 1994 in order to identify all patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). After 15 years of screening, we evaluated the geographical distribution, possible founder effects and clinical phenotype of the 12 most prevalent FH gene mutations. METHODS: Patients who carried one of the 12 most prevalent mutations, index cases and those identified between 1994 and 2009 through the screening programme and whose postal code was known were included in the study. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at the time of screening were retrieved. The prevalence of identified FH patients in each postal code area was calculated and visualised in different maps. RESULTS: A total of 10,889 patients were included in the study. Mean untreated LDL-C levels ranged from 4.4 to 6.4 mmol/l. For almost all mutations, a region of high prevalence could be observed. In total, 51 homozygous patients were identified in the Netherlands, of which 13 true homozygous for one of the 12 most prevalent mutations. The majority of them were living in high-prevalence areas for that specific mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypes with regard to LDL-C levels varied between the 12 most prevalent FH mutations. For most of these mutations, a founder effect was observed. Our observations can have implications with regard to the efficiency of molecular screening and physician's perception of FH and to the understanding of the prevalence and distribution of homozygous patients in the Netherlands.	4
p53-mediated heterochromatin reorganization regulates its cell fate decisions. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Gene Expression Regulation Heterochromatin Histones Humans Methylation Methyltransferases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Repressor Proteins Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a major sensor of cellular stresses, and its activation influences cell fate decisions. We identified SUV39H1, a histone code 'writer' responsible for the histone H3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark for 'closed' chromatin conformation, as a target of p53 repression. SUV39H1 downregulation was mediated transcriptionally by p21 and post-translationally by MDM2. The H3K9me3 repression mark was found to be associated with promoters of representative p53 target genes and was decreased upon p53 activation. Overexpression of SUV39H1 maintained higher levels of the H3K9me3 mark on these promoters and was associated with decreased p53 promoter occupancy and decreased transcriptional induction in response to p53. Conversely, SUV39H1 pre-silencing decreased H3K9me3 levels on these promoters and enhanced the p53 apoptotic response. These findings uncover a new layer of p53-mediated chromatin regulation through modulation of histone methylation at p53 target promoters.	0
Distributions of phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations and haplotypes in Lithuanian phenylketonuria patients. ||  || The distribution of phenylketonuria (PKU) mutations and haplotypes was studied in a sample of 50 families with at least one PKU child detected through the Lithuanian neonatal screening program from 1975 to 1992. Mutations were identified on 84 of the 100 alleles. Three mutations (R408W, R158Q, R261Q) together accounted for 78% of all chromosomes studied. The mutations IVS12nt1, IVS10nt546, 6272X, Q232Q were very rare. Nine different DNA haplotypes based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus were observed. The frequency of the mutant R408W is one of the highest in Europe. Most of the PKU patients were compound heterozygotes, and 47% were homozygotes for the mutations identified in this series.	1 3
Metabolic Rewiring by Oncogenic BRAF V600E Links Ketogenesis Pathway to BRAF-MEK1 Signaling. || Acetoacetates Cell Line, Tumor Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Leukemia, Hairy Cell MAP Kinase Kinase 1 Melanoma Mutation Octamer Transcription Factor-1 Oxo-Acid-Lyases Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Signal Transduction Up-Regulation || Many human cancers share similar metabolic alterations, including the Warburg effect. However, it remains unclear whether oncogene-specific metabolic alterations are required for tumor development. Here we demonstrate a "synthetic lethal" interaction between oncogenic BRAF V600E and a ketogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL). HMGCL expression is upregulated in BRAF V600E-expressing human primary melanoma and hairy cell leukemia cells. Suppression of HMGCL specifically attenuates proliferation and tumor growth potential of human melanoma cells expressing BRAF V600E. Mechanistically, active BRAF upregulates HMGCL through an octamer transcription factor Oct-1, leading to increased intracellular levels of HMGCL product, acetoacetate, which selectively enhances binding of BRAF V600E but not BRAF wild-type to MEK1 in V600E-positive cancer cells to promote activation of MEK-ERK signaling. These findings reveal a mutation-specific mechanism by which oncogenic BRAF V600E "rewires" metabolic and cell signaling networks and signals through the Oct-1-HMGCL-acetoacetate axis to selectively promote BRAF V600E-dependent tumor development.	0
Ectopic expression of cancer-testis antigens in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients. || Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte Antigens, Neoplasm Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Line, Tumor Gene Expression Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Humans Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous Membrane Glycoproteins Mutation Nuclear Proteins Proteins Skin Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) remains only partially understood. A number of recent studies attempted to identify novel diagnostic markers and future therapeutic targets. One group of antigens, cancer-testis (CT) antigens, normally present solely in testicular germ cells, can be ectopically expressed in a variety of cancers. Currently, only a few studies attempted to investigate the expression of CT antigens in CTCL. In the present work, we test the expression of CT genes in a cohort of patients with CTCL, normal skin samples, skin from benign inflammatory dermatoses, and in patient-derived CTCL cells. We correlate such expression with the p53 status and explore molecular mechanisms behind their ectopic expression in these cells. Our findings demonstrate that SYCP1, SYCP3, REC8, SPO11, and GTSF1 genes are heterogeneously expressed in patients with CTCL and patient-derived cell lines, whereas cTAGE1 (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen 1) was found to be robustly expressed in both. Mutated p53 status did not appear to be a requirement for the ectopic expression of CT antigens. While T-cell stimulation resulted in a significant upregulation of STAT3 and JUNB expression, it did not significantly alter the expression of CT antigens. Treatment of CTCL cells in vitro with vorinostat or romidepsin histone deacetylase inhibitors resulted in a significant dose-dependent upregulation of mRNA but not protein. Further expression analysis demonstrated that SYCP1, cTAGE1, and GTSF1 were expressed in CTCL, but not in normal skin or benign inflammatory dermatoses. A number of CT genes are ectopically expressed in patients with CTCL and can be used as biomarkers or novel targets for immunotherapy.	0
The syndromic deafness mutation G12R impairs fast and slow gating in Cx26 hemichannels. ||  || Mutations in connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannels can lead to syndromic deafness that affects the cochlea and skin. These mutations lead to gain-of-function hemichannel phenotypes by unknown molecular mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the biophysical properties of the syndromic mutant Cx26G12R (G12R). Unlike wild-type Cx26, G12R macroscopic hemichannel currents do not saturate upon depolarization, and deactivation is faster during hyperpolarization, suggesting that these channels have impaired fast and slow gating. Single G12R hemichannels show a large increase in open probability, and transitions to the subconductance state are rare and short-lived, demonstrating an inoperative fast gating mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that G12R causes a displacement of the N terminus toward the cytoplasm, favoring an interaction between R12 in the N terminus and R99 in the intracellular loop. Disruption of this interaction recovers the fast and slow voltage-dependent gating mechanisms. These results suggest that the mechanisms of fast and slow gating in connexin hemichannels are coupled and provide a molecular mechanism for the gain-of-function phenotype displayed by the syndromic G12R mutation.	0
[Screening of hot-spot deafness gene mutations among 277 cochlear implantation patients in Sichuan province]. || cochlear implantation deafness gene mutation || <b>Objective:</b>To investigate the spectrum and incidence of the hot-spot deafness gene mutations of 277 patients with cochlear implantation in Sichuan province, and to provide information of the prevention and treatment for clinical application. <b>Method:</b> The data of the hotspot deafness gene mutations screening of 277 patients with cochlear implantation was analyzed retrospectively. A deafness related gene mutations detection kit was used to detect 9 mutation sites in four deafness-associated genes,including GJB2(35delG,176del16,235delC,299delAT), GJB3(538C＞T),SLC26A4(2168A＞G, IVS7-2A＞G), Mitochondrial 12SrRNA(1494C＞T, 1555A＞G). <b>Result:</b> ① A total of 122 patients with hot-spot Deafness Gene Mutations were detected in 277 cochlear implantation patients(44.04%),among which there were 39 patients were GJB2235delC homozygous mutation(14.08%), 23 patients were GJB2 235delC heterozygous mutation(8.30%), 1 patient was GJB2 299delAT homozygous mutation(0.36%), 2 patients were GJB2 176del16& 235delC compound heterozygous mutation(0.72%), 13 patients were GJB2 235delC& 299delAT compound heterozygous mutation(4.69%), 2 patients were SLC26A4 2168A＞G heterozygous mutation(0.72%), 16 patients were SLC26A4 IVS7-2A＞G homozygous mutation(5.78%), 22 patient were SLC26A4 IVS7-2A＞G heterozygous mutation(7.94%), 1 patients was SLC26A4 2168A＞G& IVS7-2A＞G compound heterozygous mutation(0.36%), 2 patients were mitochondrial 12SrRNA gene 1555A＞G homogenous mutation(0.72%), 1 patient carried both GJB2 235delC homozygous mutation and SLC26A4 IVS7-2A＞G heterozygous mutation(0.36%). ②A total of 49 patients with LVAS were found in 277 cochlear implantation patients: including 15 patients with IVS7-2A＞G homozygous mutation(30.61%), 22 patients with IVS7-2A＞G heterozygous mutation(44.90%), 1 patient with 2168A＞G heterozygous mutation(2.04%), 1 patient with complex heterozygosis mutations of 2168A＞G and IVS7-2A＞G(2.04%), 1 patient with GJB2 235delC homozygous mutation(2.04%) and 1 patient with GJB2 235delC&299delAT compound heterozygous mutation(2.04%), and no hotspot deafness gene mutations were found in 8 patients. ③There were 40 out of 277 cochlear implantation patients with definite family history.There was no statistic difference of the detection rate of hot-spot deafness gene mutations between in patients with family deafness history (57.50%) and in patients without family deafness history (41.77%). ④A total of 273 patients with profound binaural deafness were found among 277 cochlear implantation patients. Three patients with profound deafness in right ear and severe deafness in left ear were found among 277 cochlear implantation patients.Two patients of three were SLC26A4 IVS7-2A＞G heterozygosis mutations, and one patient of three was GJB2 235delC heterozygosis mutations; 1 patient with profound deafness in left ear and severe deafness in right ear was found among 277 cochlear implantation patients,and was GJB2 235delC heterozygosis mutations. <b>Conclusion:</b>① The detection rate of hotspot deafness gene mutations in 277 cochlear implantation patients is 44.04%(122/277). GJB2 Mutation is the most common, SLC26A4 mutation takes the second place, mitochondrial 12SrRNAgene mutation is not common and GJB3 mutation is not found in this study.② SLC26A4 mutation may not be the sole pathogenic factor of LVAS. ③ The results of this study suggest that the genetic background of cochlear implants patients has little effect on the data of the hotspot deafness gene mutations screening.	4
Mutation analysis of Phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in Iranian patients with Phenylketonuria. ||  || Background: Phenylketonuria as the most common genetic metabolic disorder is the result of disruption of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. This study was carried out to explore the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutation status of Iranian phenylketonuria patients.Methods: Blood samples were collected from 30 patients, and hot spot areas of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, including exons 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 were studied through polymerase chain reaction and sequencing techniques.Results: Eight different mutations, including 5 missense mutations, 1 splice mutation, 1 nonsense mutation, and 1 Silent/Splice mutation were detected. These mutations were R243X, R261Q, R261X, P281L, R241C, V399V, E280K, and IVS11+1G>C. V399V and R241C were reported for the first time in Iranian population. Three polymorphisms including Q232Q, V245V and L385L and 3 novel intronic variants including IVS10-15A>C, IVS6+44T>G, and IVS6+36 T>G were also detected in this study.Conclusion: The results of this study prove the heterogeneous status of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in the Iranian population, which can be useful in carrier testing and genetic counseling.	3
Scalp fibroblasts have a shared expression profile in monogenic craniosynostosis. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Case-Control Studies Child, Preschool Cluster Analysis Craniosynostoses Fibroblasts Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation Humans Infant Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Reproducibility of Results Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Scalp Syndrome || Craniosynostosis can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors, the relative contributions of which vary between patients. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic mutation or chromosomal abnormality in ∼ 21% of cases, but it is likely that further causative mutations remain to be discovered. To identify a shared signature of genetically determined craniosynostosis by comparing the expression patterns in three monogenic syndromes with a control group of patients with non-syndromic sagittal synostosis. Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured. The relative expression of ∼ 47,000 transcripts was quantified on Affymetrix arrays. 435, 45 and 46 transcripts were identified in the Apert, Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen groups, respectively, that differed significantly from the controls. Forty-six of these transcripts were shared between two or more syndromes and, in all but one instance, showed the same direction of altered expression level compared with controls. Pathway analysis showed over-representation of the shared transcripts in core modules involving cell-to-cell communication and signal transduction. Individual samples from the Apert syndrome cases could be reliably distinguished from non-syndromic samples based on the gene expression profile, but this was not possible for samples from patients with Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen syndromes. Common modules of altered gene expression shared by genetically distinct forms of craniosynostosis were identified. Although the expression profiles cannot currently be used to classify individual patients, this may be overcome by using more sensitive assays and sampling additional tissues.	4
Conformational transition pathway in the activation process of allosteric glucokinase. || Allosteric Regulation Binding Sites Enzyme Activation Glucokinase Glucose Humans Hydrogen Bonding Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions Molecular Docking Simulation Molecular Dynamics Simulation Protein Binding Protein Conformation || Glucokinase (GK) is a glycolytic enzyme that plays an important role in regulating blood glucose level, thus acting as a potentially attractive target for drug discovery in the treatment of diabetes of the young type 2 and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. To characterize the activation mechanism of GK from the super-open state (inactive state) to the closed state (active state), a series of conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and targeted MD (TMD) simulations were performed on this enzyme. Conventional MD simulation showed a specific conformational ensemble of GK when the enzyme is inactive. Seven TMD simulations depicted a reliably conformational transition pathway of GK from the inactive state to the active state, and the components important to the conformational change of GK were identified by analyzing the detailed structures of the TMD trajectories. In combination with the inactivation process, our findings showed that the whole conformational pathway for the activation-inactivation-activation of GK is a one-direction circulation, and the active state is less stable than the inactive state in the circulation. Additionally, glucose was demonstrated to gradually modulate its binding pose with the help of residues in the large domain and connecting region of GK during the activation process. Furthermore, the obtained energy barriers were used to explain the preexisting equilibrium and the slow binding kinetic process of the substrate by GK. The simulated results are in accordance with the recent findings from the mutagenesis experiments and kinetic analyses. Our observations reveal a complicated conformational process in the allosteric protein, resulting in new knowledge about the delicate mechanisms for allosteric biological macromolecules that will be useful in drug design for targeting allosteric proteins.	0
Germline mutations in E-cadherin do not explain association of hereditary prostate cancer, gastric cancer and breast cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms Cadherins Colorectal Neoplasms DNA DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Female Germ-Line Mutation Humans Introns Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree Polymerase Chain Reaction Prostatic Neoplasms Stomach Neoplasms || Somatic mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene have frequently been reported in cases with diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancers. Recently, germline mutations have been identified in families with diffuse gastric cancers. In families with hereditary prostate cancer (HPC), a significant association of prostate cancer, gastric and/or breast cancer has been observed in epidemiological studies. The aim of this study was to investigate if germline mutations in CDH1 could explain the risk for cancer in HPC families with an excess of gastric and breast cancer. In total, 17 members from 13 HPC families and 3 members from 3 families with hereditary gastric cancer (HGC) were screened for germline CDH1 sequence alterations using PCR/Denaturing HPLC for initial screening of nucleotide variants followed by confirmatory direct sequencing analysis. The frequency of identified novel germline mutations were tested for in 136 cases with hereditary prostate cancer and 215 cases of sporadic prostate cancer with 422 age matched controls in an allelic discrimination assay. In total, 8 sequence variants were detected in 20 samples tested. In the HPC families, we found 2 missense mutations, A592T in exon 12 and a novel D777N in exon 15 and a mutation in intron 5, 687+92T>A. A previously known polymorphism in exon 13 and 3 sequence variations in introns and untranslated regions were also found, of which the significance is unknown. In HGC-023 with early onset diffuse gastric cancer a truncating mutation, R335X, was identified in exon 7. None of the missense mutations or 687+92T>A were found in the extended HPC material or in the sporadic prostate cancer cases with age-matched controls in the allelic discrimination assay. We found several germline mutations of unknown clinical significance in the CDH1 gene that probably do not explain the association of prostate, gastric and/or breast cancers in the HPC-families. Two missense mutations and a mutation in intron 5 were identified that do not influence the risk of hereditary or sporadic prostate cancer in general and are considered to be pedigree specific. In a family with hereditary gastric cancer of the diffuse type, we identified the first truncating germline mutation in a Scandinavian family.	4
A cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome case with tight Achilles tendons. ||  || Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS) is a multiple congenital anomaly disorder characterized by craniofacial features, cardiac defects, ectodermal anomalies and neurocognitive delay. Clinical findings of patients with CFCS show similarities to those of patients with Costello Syndrome (CS). CFCS and CS are caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. Musculoskeletal findings including tight Achilles tendons and contractures of elbows, shoulders or hips have been reported in CS patients. However, limited extension of joints were observed in some patients with CFCS. According to the literature, no tight Achilles tendons have been reported in CFCS patients so far. In this case report, we present a male CFCS patient with tight Achilles tendons with a de-novo heterozygote N581D mutation in the BRAF gene detected by DNA sequence analysis.	4
Longitudinal phenotypic analysis in patients with connexin 26 (GJB2) (DFNB1) and connexin 30 (GJB6) mutations. || Adolescent Adult Audiometry, Pure-Tone Auditory Threshold Child Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Fragmentation DNA Mutational Analysis Follow-Up Studies Gene Deletion Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Pedigree Phenotype Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Severity of Illness Index || In 15 Belgian subjects with prelingual sensorineural hearing impairment, the connexin 26 (GJB2) gene and the connexin 30 (GJB6) gene were analyzed for the presence of the 35delG mutation and the delta(GJB6-D13S1830) deletion first described by del Castillo et al in 2002. Seven patients were found to be homozygous for the 35delG mutation; 7 were combined heterozygotes for the 35delG mutation and the GJB6 deletion. In 11 subjects, phenotype and genotype were correlated. Significant, transient progression, in the range of 1.7 to 2.7 dB/y, was only found in 2 patients in the first part of the second decade of life. Hearing impairment was otherwise stable, with mean thresholds of 75, 90, and 100 dB at 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 kHz, respectively, and 100 dB or higher at 1 to 4 kHz. There was no significant difference in hearing impairment between the patients with the homozygous 35delG mutation in GJB2 and those who are heterozygous for both the 35delG mutation and the deletion encompassing part of GJB6.	4
[The mutation spectrum of the GJB2 gene in Belarussian patients with hearing loss. Results of pilot genetic screening of hearing impairment in newborns]. || Adult Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Female Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Republic of Belarus Sequence Deletion || A total of 111 unrelated probands and their 8 sibs from Grodno oblast (Belarus) with bilateral isolated sensorineural hearing impairment were studied for the presence of mutations in the connexin 26--GJB2gene. Mutations were detected in 51 probands (46% of the sample). A significantly higher frequency of the GJB2gene mutations was observed in familial cases of the disease with the autosomal recessive type of inheritance (in 78% of families). Detected peculiarities of the GJB2 gene mutation spectrum demonstrated that use of the algorithm, which was developed for Russian patients, is optimal for the molecular study of patients from Be- larus. In the sample of patients with hearing loss, the highest (among other similar samples studied in the world) allele frequency of c.313_326de114 mutation (7% out of all pathological GJB2 alleles) was registered; Polish origin of this deletion was suggested. It was demonstrated that detection of the GJB2 gene mutation on only one patient's chromosome is insufficient to confirm a molecular genetic diagnosis of hearing loss of the DFNB1 genetic type (autosomal recessive hearing loss caused by the GJB2 gene mutations). Pilot screening in the presence of GJB2 gene mutations in newborns from Grodno oblast was conducted. The material from 235 children was studied during the screening; nine heterozygous carriers of the mutation were found. The c.35delG mutation was detected in a homozygous state in a single newborn (hearing loss of moderate severity was subsequently audiologically confirmed in this child).	4
Protein Cofactors Are Essential for High-Affinity DNA Binding by the Nuclear Factor κB RelA Subunit. || Cell Line Cell Nucleus Coenzymes DNA-Binding Proteins Gene Expression Regulation Humans NF-kappa B Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Protein Domains Ribosomal Proteins Transcription Factor RelA Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Transcription activator proteins typically contain two functional domains: a DNA binding domain (DBD) that binds to DNA with sequence specificity and an activation domain (AD) whose established function is to recruit RNA polymerase. In this report, we show that purified recombinant nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) RelA dimers bind specific κB DNA sites with an affinity significantly lower than that of the same dimers from nuclear extracts of activated cells, suggesting that additional nuclear cofactors might facilitate DNA binding by the RelA dimers. Additionally, recombinant RelA binds DNA with relatively low affinity at a physiological salt concentration in vitro. The addition of p53 or RPS3 (ribosomal protein S3) increases RelA:DNA binding affinity 2- to >50-fold depending on the protein and ionic conditions. These cofactor proteins do not form stable ternary complexes, suggesting that they stabilize the RelA:DNA complex through dynamic interactions. Surprisingly, the RelA-DBD alone fails to bind DNA under the same solution conditions even in the presence of cofactors, suggesting an important role of the RelA-AD in DNA binding. Reduced RelA:DNA binding at a physiological ionic strength suggests that multiple cofactors might be acting simultaneously to mitigate the electrolyte effect and stabilize the RelA:DNA complex in vivo. Overall, our observations suggest that the RelA-AD and multiple cofactor proteins function cooperatively to prime the RelA-DBD and stabilize the RelA:DNA complex in cells. Our study provides a mechanism for nuclear cofactor proteins in NF-κB-dependent gene regulation.	0
The MYH7 p.R787H mutation causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two unrelated families. ||  || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is a Mendelian disorder usually caused by mutations in any one of more than 12 genes, most of which encode sarcomere proteins. The disease exhibits extensive genetic heterogeneity, and it is important to identify mutations that result in adverse symptoms and/or lethality in affected individuals. An analysis of disease-causing mutations has been initiated in the Indian population to determine prevalent mutations. FHC was detected using echocardiography and by analysis of clinical symptoms and family history. The disease-causing mutation was identified using polymerase chain reaction DNA sequencing. The p.R787H mutation was identified in the MYH7 gene in two FHC families. Sequence and structure analysis suggested impaired binding of the mutant protein to the myosin essential light chain. Although the mutation results in variable clinical symptoms in the affected individuals, probably owing to the effect of modifier genes and/or environmental factors, it does not appear to be a lethal mutation.	4
Postoperative cognitive outcome for synostotic frontal plagiocephaly. || Age Factors Child, Preschool Cognition Craniosynostoses Female Follow-Up Studies Frontal Bone Humans Infant Intelligence Intracranial Pressure Male Prospective Studies Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Treatment Outcome || The goals of this study were to evaluate the cognitive outcome after surgery for synostotic frontal plagiocephaly and to compare the effects of early (< 1 year of age) and late (> or = 1 year of age) surgical correction on intellectual development. In a prospective study involving 220 patients, both preoperative and postoperative cognitive function were measured using developmental quotient (DQ) or intelligence quotient (IQ) determination. Preoperative intracranial pressure (ICP) was also measured, and the presence of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) P250R mutation was assessed. Preoperative DQ/IQ was not affected by patient age at the time of surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in mean postoperative IQ between patients who underwent surgery before 1 year of age and those who underwent surgery at 1 year of age or older. In the latter group, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of elevated ICP (> or = 15 mm Hg in 16%), but no effect on cognitive outcome was observed. Likewise, there was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of the FGFR3 mutation and postoperative IQ. The indication for surgical correction appears to be largely cosmetic.	4
Experience of targeted Usher exome sequencing as a clinical test. ||  || We show that massively parallel targeted sequencing of 19 genes provides a new and reliable strategy for molecular diagnosis of Usher syndrome (USH) and nonsyndromic deafness, particularly appropriate for these disorders characterized by a high clinical and genetic heterogeneity and a complex structure of several of the genes involved. A series of 71 patients including Usher patients previously screened by Sanger sequencing plus newly referred patients was studied. Ninety-eight percent of the variants previously identified by Sanger sequencing were found by next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS proved to be efficient as it offers analysis of all relevant genes which is laborious to reach with Sanger sequencing. Among the 13 newly referred Usher patients, both mutations in the same gene were identified in 77% of cases (10 patients) and one candidate pathogenic variant in two additional patients. This work can be considered as pilot for implementing NGS for genetically heterogeneous diseases in clinical service.	4
Gender-Specific Molecular and Clinical Features Underlie Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Case-Control Studies Female Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Mesothelioma Middle Aged Pleural Neoplasms Sex Factors Young Adult || Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer that occurs more frequently in men, but is associated with longer survival in women. Insight into the survival advantage of female patients may advance the molecular understanding of MPM and identify therapeutic interventions that will improve the prognosis for all MPM patients. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing of tumor specimens from 10 MPM patients and matched control samples to identify potential driver mutations underlying MPM. We identified molecular differences associated with gender and histology. Specifically, single-nucleotide variants of BAP1 were observed in 21% of cases, with lower mutation rates observed in sarcomatoid MPM (P < 0.001). Chromosome 22q loss was more frequently associated with the epithelioid than that nonepitheliod histology (P = 0.037), whereas CDKN2A deletions occurred more frequently in nonepithelioid subtypes among men (P = 0.021) and were correlated with shorter overall survival for the entire cohort (P = 0.002) and for men (P = 0.012). Furthermore, women were more likely to harbor TP53 mutations (P = 0.004). Novel mutations were found in genes associated with the integrin-linked kinase pathway, including MYH9 and RHOA. Moreover, expression levels of BAP1, MYH9, and RHOA were significantly higher in nonepithelioid tumors, and were associated with significant reduction in survival of the entire cohort and across gender subgroups. Collectively, our findings indicate that diverse mechanisms highly related to gender and histology appear to drive MPM.	4
Functional studies on twenty novel naturally occurring melanocortin-4 receptor mutations. || Amino Acid Sequence Cyclic AMP HEK293 Cells Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Signal Transduction Transfection alpha-MSH beta-MSH || The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor critically involved in regulating energy balance. MC4R activation results in decreased food intake and increased energy expenditure. Genetic and pharmacological studies demonstrated that the MC4R regulation of energy balance is conserved from fish to mammals. In humans, more than 150 naturally occurring mutations in the MC4R gene have been identified. Functional study of mutant MC4Rs is an important component in proving the causal link between MC4R mutation and obesity as well as the basis of personalized medicine. In this article, we studied 20 MC4R mutations that were either not characterized or not fully characterized. We showed that 11 mutants had decreased or absent cell surface expression. D126Y was defective in ligand binding. Three mutants were constitutively active but had decreased cell surface expression. Eleven mutants had decreased basal signaling, with two mutants defective only in this parameter, suggesting that impaired basal signaling might also be a cause of obesity. Five mutants had normal functions. In summary, we provided detailed functional data for further studies on identifying therapeutic approaches for personalized medicine to treat patients harboring these mutations.	0
The use of buccal smears for a non-invasive screening of the 35delG mutation of the Connexin-26 gene in hearing impaired young children. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Cytodiagnosis DNA Electrophoresis, Agar Gel Feasibility Studies Frameshift Mutation Guanine Hearing Loss Humans Infant Mass Screening Middle Aged Mouth Mucosa Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Photometry Polymerase Chain Reaction Reproducibility of Results || Recent advances in genetic research indicate that about 50% of congenital deaf patients have a genetic background, with mutations in the Connexin-26 gene being the most frequent one. Screening methods for the genetic cause of deafness have so far mostly been based on the use of peripheral whole blood as DNA source. The use of buccal smears for the genetic screening of deaf patients presents an interesting alternative to drawing blood, especially in young children. In order to validate this method, we compared results from buccal smears from very young deaf children (age<or=3 years) and deaf patients older than 3 years with the results from blood samples deriving from the same patients. The detection of the 35delG mutation in the Connexin-26 gene was chosen to demonstrate the method's feasibility. Blood and buccal smears were collected for genetic analysis from 29 very young deaf children (Group 1: age<or=3 years) and 31 deaf patients older than 3 years (Group 2) during their clinical pre-evaluation for cochlear implantation. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood as well as from buccal smears. Yield of both sources was determined by photometric evaluation of the isolated DNA concentration. Genomic DNA isolated from blood and buccal smears was then submitted to PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis followed by BS1 YI restriction and electrophoresis. The results for 35delG detection in DNA originating from blood were compared to those of buccal smears. Quantitative DNA analysis showed that both sources provided adequate amounts of DNA for PCR. No significant difference was found between Group 1 and Group 2 considering either the DNA amount isolated from blood or from buccal smears. In all 60 patients, DNA isolated from blood revealed the same results concerning the presence of the 35delG mutation as DNA originating from buccal smears. This study demonstrates that buccal smears are an adequate, reliable source of genomic DNA providing material for genetic tests that can especially help to avoid drawing blood from very young children for the genetic screening of deafness.	4
Acquired somatic TP53 orPIK3CA mutations are potential predictors of when polyps evolve into colorectal cancer. ||  || Colorectal cancer (CRC) develops from accumulated mutations. However, which gene determines the malignant transformation from adenoma to carcinoma is still uncertain. Fifty-three formalin fixed paraffin-embedded polyps that had pathological findings from patients with hyperplasia, adenomatous, and tubular adenoma < 1 cm (non-neoplasia polyps, NNP, n = 27) or tubular adenoma ≥ 1 cm, tubulovillous and villous adenoma (neoplastic polyps, NP,n = 26) were recruited. Six paired synchronous polyps and cancer tissues and 50 independent fresh CRC tumors were also collected. All tissues were analyzed for their mutation genomes using next generation sequencing with a 50-gene panel. There were 40 types of somatic variants found in 7 genes,APC (43%),KRAS (28%),TP53 (11%),FBXW7 (8%),GNAS (4%),SMAD4 (2%), andBRAF (2%), and they were detected in 32 (60%) polyps. If combined with the mutation spectrum found in CRC tissues, a significant increase in the mutation rate inTP53 andPIK3CA from NNP, NP, early and late stage carcinoma (7%, 15%, 33.3% and 65% for TP53,p < 0.001; 0%, 0%, 23.3% and 25% forPIK3CA,p = 0.002) were noticed. Furthermore, distinct molecular features can be found in five pairs of synchronous polyps and tumors. However,TP53 orPIK3CA mutations can be found in tumor tissues but not in polyps. By systematically investigating the genome from polyps to tumor tissues, we demonstrated that acquiredTP53 orPIK3CA somatic mutations are potential predictors for malignancy development. These results may aid in the identification of high risk individuals with tissues harboring mutations in these two genes.	4
Mutations of KRAS/NRAS/BRAF predict cetuximab resistance in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. || Adult Aged Antineoplastic Agents Biomarkers, Tumor Cetuximab Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Approximately 45% of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with wild-type KRAS exon 2 are resistant to cetuximab treatment. We set out to identify additional genetic markers that might predict the response to cetuximab treatment. Fifty-three wild-type KRAS exon 2 mCRC patients were treated with cetuximab/irinotecan-based chemotherapy as a first- or third-line therapy. The mutational statuses of 10 EGFR pathway genes were analyzed in primary tumors using next-generation sequencing. BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS (exons 3 and 4), NRAS, PTEN, and AKT1 mutations were detected in 6, 6, 5, 4, 1, and 1 patient, respectively. Four of the BRAF mutations were non-V600 variants. Four tumors harbored multiple co-existing (complex) mutations. All patients with BRAF mutations or complex mutation patterns were cetuximab non-responders. All patients but one harboring KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutations were non-responders. Mutations in any one of these three genes were associated with a poor response rate (7.1%) and reduced survival (PFS = 8.0 months) compared to wild-type patients (74.4% and 11.6 months). Our data suggest that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations predict response to cetuximab treatment in mCRC patients.	4
In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of Lucitanib in FGFR1/2 Amplified or Mutated Cancer Models. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Disease Models, Animal Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Gene Amplification Gene Dosage Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Mice Mutation Naphthalenes Protein Kinase Inhibitors Quinolines Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1 Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 Tumor Burden Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway has been implicated both as an escape mechanism from anti-angiogenic therapy and as a driver oncogene in different tumor types. Lucitanib is a small molecule inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1 to 3 (VEGFR1 to 3), platelet derived growth factor α/β (PDGFRα/β) and FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinases and has demonstrated activity in a phase I/II clinical study, with objective RECIST responses in breast cancer patients with FGFR1 or FGF3/4/19 gene amplification, as well as in patients anticipated to benefit from anti-angiogenic agents. We report here the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of lucitanib in experimental models with or without FGFR1/2 amplification or mutations. In cell assays, lucitanib potently inhibited the growth of tumor cell lines with amplified FGFR1 or mutated/amplified FGFR2. In all xenograft models studied, lucitanib demonstrated marked tumor growth inhibition due to potent inhibition of angiogenesis. Notably, in two lung cancer models with FGFR1 amplification, the antitumor efficacy was higher, suggesting that the simultaneous inhibition of VEGF and FGF receptors in FGFR1 dependent tumors can be therapeutically advantageous. Similar antitumor activity was observed in FGFR2 wild-type and amplified or mutated xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic studies showed lucitanib plasma concentrations in the micro/sub-micromolar range demonstrated drug accumulation following repeated lucitanib administration.	0
Detection of BRAF Mutations Using a Fully Automated Platform and Comparison with High Resolution Melting, Real-Time Allele Specific Amplification, Immunohistochemistry and Next Generation Sequencing Assays, for Patients with Metastatic Melanoma. || Alleles Automation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Melanoma Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf || Metastatic melanoma is a severe disease with one of the highest mortality rate in skin diseases. Overall survival has significantly improved with immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Kinase inhibitors targeting BRAF V600 showed promising results. BRAF genotyping is mandatory for the prescription of anti-BRAF therapies. Fifty-nine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma samples were assessed using High-Resolution-Melting (HRM) PCR, Real-time allele-specific amplification (RT-ASA) PCR, Next generation sequencing (NGS), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the fully-automated molecular diagnostics platform IdyllaTM. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated using NGS as the reference standard to compare the different assays. BRAF mutations were found in 28(47.5%), 29(49.2%), 31(52.5%), 29(49.2%) and 27(45.8%) samples with HRM, RT-ASA, NGS, IdyllaTM and IHC respectively. Twenty-six (81.2%) samples were found bearing a c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu) mutation, three (9.4%) with a c.1798_1799delinsAA (p.Val600Lys) mutation and one with c.1789_1790delinsTC (p.Leu597Ser) mutation. Two samples were found bearing complex mutations. HRM appears the less sensitive assay for the detection of BRAF V600 mutations. The RT-ASA, IdyllaTM and IHC assays are suitable for routine molecular diagnostics aiming at the prescription of anti-BRAF therapies. IdyllaTM assay is fully-automated and requires less than 2 minutes for samples preparation and is the fastest of the tested assays.	4
Cholesterol: the good, the bad, and the ugly - therapeutic targets for the treatment of dyslipidemia. || Animals Apolipoprotein A-I Apolipoproteins B Atherosclerosis Cardiovascular Diseases Cholesterol Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Dyslipidemias Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Lipase Phosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferase Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Serine Endopeptidases Triglycerides || Maintaining cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels within healthy limits is critical for decreasing the risk of heart disease. Dyslipidemia refers to the abnormal levels of lipids in the blood, including low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), also known as good cholesterol, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), also known as bad cholesterol, and/or high TG levels that contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In this article we reviewed some of the current therapeutic targets for the treatment of dyslipidemia, with a primary focus on endothelial lipase and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase for raising HDL-C, and the proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and the messenger RNA of apolipoprotein B for lowering LDL-C. In addition, we reviewed the role of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) in raising HDL-C, where we discuss three apoAI-based drugs under development. These are its mutated dimer (apoAI-Milano), a complex with phospholipids, and a mimetic peptide. Atherosclerosis, mainly because of dyslipidemia, is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease. Regarding the title of this article, the 'good' refers to HDL-C, the 'bad' refers to LDL-C, and the 'ugly' refers to atherosclerosis.	4
[Mutation of Gap junction protein beta 2 gene and treatment outcome of cochlear implantation in cochlear implantation recipients]. ||  || To investigate the Gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) gene mutation in cochlear implantation (CI) recipients and the treatment outcome of CI in the CI recipients with GJB2 gene mutation. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 253 CI recipients with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI), 174 males and 79 females, aged (8 +/- 9) (112 months-52.7 years), and 301 children with normal hearing level as controls. PCR was used to detect the GJB2 mutations. The auditory threshold with CI and speech recognition of the CI recipients with GJB2 mutation were compared with those of the CI recipients without GJB2 mutation (control group). Questionnaire survey, with meaningful auditory integration scale (MAIS), categories of auditory performance (CAP), and speech intelligibility rating (SIR), was used for young infants. Sixty-seven of the 253 CI recipients (26.5%) were found to have GJB2 mutations. One novel mutation, GJB2 235delC/598G > A, was identified. The detection rates of GJB2 mutations in the CI recipients were significantly higher than those among the controls (all P < 0.05). The postoperative outcomes of CI in both the GJB2 gene mutation positive and negative groups were very good, however, without significant differences among these 2 groups (all P > 0.05). GJB2 gene mutation is one of the major causes for CI recipients with autosomal recessive NSHI. The treatment outcomes of CI recipients with GJB2 gene mutations under 7 years old are satisfying.	4
MEK genomics in development and disease. || Animals Cluster Analysis Ectodermal Dysplasia Facies Failure to Thrive Genetic Variation Genomics Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Mice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Models, Genetic Mutation Neoplasms Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Conformation Protein Structure, Tertiary || The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (the MAPK/ERK kinases; MKKs or MEKs) and their downstream substrates, the extracellular-regulated kinases have been intensively studied for their roles in development and disease. Until recently, it had been assumed any mutation affecting their function would have lethal consequences. However, the identification of MEK1 and MEK2 mutations in developmental syndromes as well as chemotherapy-resistant tumors, and the discovery of genomic variants in MEK1 and MEK2 have led to the realization the extent of genomic variation associated with MEKs is much greater than had been appreciated. In this review, we will discuss these recent advances, relating them to what is currently understood about the structure and function of MEKs, and describe how they change our understanding of the role of MEKs in development and disease.	0
Detection of somatic variants and EGFR mutations in cell-free DNA from non-small cell lung cancer patients by ultra-deep sequencing using the ion ampliseq cancer hotspot panel and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. ||  || Highly sensitive genotyping assays can detect mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from cancer patients, reflecting the biology of each patient's cancer. Because circulating tumor DNA comprises a small, variable fraction of DNA circulating in the blood, sensitive parallel multiplexing tests are required to determine mutation profiles. We prospectively examined the clinical utility of ultra-deep sequencing analysis of cfDNA from 126 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (ICP) and validated these findings with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). ICP results were compared with tumor tissue genotyping (TTG) results and clinical outcomes. A total of 853 variants were detected, with a median of four variants per patient. Overall concordance of ICP and TTG analyses was 90% for EGFR exon 19 deletion and 88% for the L858R mutation. Of 34 patients with a well-defined EGFR activating mutation defined based on the results of ICP and TTG, 31 (81.6%) showed long-term disease control with EGFR TKI treatment. Of 56 patients treated with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), the presence of thede novo T790M mutation was confirmed in 28 (50%). Presence of thisde novo mutation did not have a negative effect on EGFR TKI treatment. Ultra-deep sequencing analysis of cfDNA using ICP combined with confirmatory ddPCR was effective at defining driver genetic changes in NSCLC patients. Comprehensive analysis of tumor DNA and cfDNA can increase the specificity of molecular diagnosis, which could translate into tailored treatment.	4
Distinct functional defect of three novel Brugada syndrome related cardiac sodium channel mutations. || Brugada Syndrome Cell Line DNA Mutational Analysis Electrocardiography Humans Ion Channel Gating Muscle Proteins Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Patch-Clamp Techniques Sodium Channels Taiwan Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel beta-1 Subunit || The Brugada syndrome is characterized by ST segment elevation in the right precodial leads V1-V3 on surface ECG accompanied by episodes of ventricular fibrillation causing syncope or even sudden death. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to Brugada syndrome are not yet completely understood. However, SCN5A is the most well known responsible gene that causes Brugada syndrome. Until now, more than a hundred mutations in SCN5A responsible for Brugada syndrome have been described. Functional studies of some of the mutations have been performed and show that a reduction of human cardiac sodium current accounts for the pathogenesis of Brugada syndrome. Here we reported three novel SCN5A mutations identified in patients with Brugada syndrome in Taiwan (p.I848fs, p.R965C, and p.1876insM). Their electrophysiological properties were altered by patch clamp analysis. The p.I848fs mutant generated no sodium current. The p.R965C and p.1876insM mutants produced channels with steady state inactivation shifted to a more negative potential (9.4 mV and 8.5 mV respectively), and slower recovery from inactivation. Besides, the steady state activation of p.1876insM was altered and was shifted to a more positive potential (7.69 mV). In conclusion, the SCN5A channel defect related to Brugada syndrome might be diverse but all resulted in a decrease of sodium current.	0
Oncogenic mutations in melanomas and benign melanocytic nevi of the female genital tract. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Female GTP Phosphohydrolases GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11 Genital Neoplasms, Female Humans Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Nevus, Pigmented Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Retrospective Studies || The genetic heterogeneity of melanomas and melanocytic nevi of the female genital tract is poorly understood. We aim to characterize the frequency of mutations of the following genes: BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNA11, and GNAQ in female genital tract melanomas. We also characterize the frequency of BRAF mutations in female genital tract melanomas compared with melanocytic nevi. Mutational screening was performed on the following female genital tract melanocytic neoplasms: 25 melanomas, 7 benign melanocytic nevi, and 4 atypical melanocytic nevi. Of the 25 female genital tract melanoma specimens queried, KIT mutations were detected in 4 (16.0%), NRAS mutations in 4 (16.0%), and BRAF mutations in 2 (8.0%) samples. Two of the tumors with KIT mutations harbored double mutations in the same exon. No GNAQ or GNA11 mutations were identified among 11 melanomas screened. BRAF V600E mutations were detected in 7 of 7 benign melanocytic genital nevi (100%) and 3 of 4 atypical genital nevi (75%). Our study is limited by the small sample size of this rare subset of melanomas. KIT, NRAS, and BRAF mutations are found in a subset of female genital tract melanomas. Screening for oncogenic mutations is important for developing and applying clinical therapies for melanomas of the female genital tract.	4
Multilayered Omics-Based Analysis of a Head and Neck Cancer Model of Cisplatin Resistance Reveals Intratumoral Heterogeneity and Treatment-Induced Clonal Selection. ||  || Purpose: Platinum-based drugs, in particular cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II), CDDP), are used for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Despite initial responses, CDDP treatment often results in chemoresistance, leading to therapeutic failure. The role of primary resistance at subclonal level and treatment-induced clonal selection in the development of CDDP resistance remains unknown.Experimental Design: By applying targeted next-generation sequencing, fluorescencein situ hybridization, microarray-based transcriptome, and mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteome analysis to the CDDP-sensitive SCCHN cell line FaDu, a CDDP-resistant subline, and single-cell derived subclones, the molecular basis of CDDP resistance was elucidated. The causal relationship between molecular features and resistant phenotypes was determined by siRNA-based gene silencing. The clinical relevance of molecular findings was validated in patients with SCCHN with recurrence after CDDP-based chemoradiation and the TCGA SCCHN dataset.Results: Evidence of primary resistance at clonal level and clonal selection by long-term CDDP treatment was established in the FaDu model. Resistance was associated with aneuploidy of chromosome 17, increasedTP53 copy-numbers and overexpression of the gain-of-function (GOF) mutant variant p53R248L siRNA-mediated knockdown established a causal relationship between mutant p53R248L and CDDP resistance. Resistant clones were also characterized by increased activity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. The poor prognostic value of GOFTP53 variants and mTOR pathway upregulation was confirmed in the TCGA SCCHN cohort.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a link of intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution as important mechanisms of drug resistance in SCCHN and establishes mutant GOFTP53 variants and the PI3K/mTOR pathway as molecular targets for treatment optimization.Clin Cancer Res; 24(1); 158-68. ©2017 AACR.	0
Late onset form of Pompe disease. || GAA gene. Pompe disease α-glucosidase || Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by deficiency in lysosomal enzyme α-glucosidase. We present first two patients from Slovakia with confirmed Pompe disease. Activity of α-glucosidase was measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-D-glucopyranoside with the presence of acarbose, inhibitor that eliminates isoenzyme interference of maltase-glucoamylase. This methodical approach is substantial for determination of lysosomal enzyme deficiency. Using molecular genetic methods, PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing of coding region α-glucosidase gene (GAA) we have identified causal mutations in our patients. Late-onset type of disease was confirmed by measuring α-glucosidase activity in leukocytes isolated from blood. The presence of common Caucasian mutation c.-32-13T>G was proved by genetic testing in the first patient in homozygous state. Second patient was a compound heterozygote, with mutation c.-32-13T>G on one allele and mutation A486P on the second allele. We present a diagnostic algorithm for diagnosing the Pompe disease in patients of European origin. Enzyme replacement therapy has been used as a treatment option for improving the quality of life of patients. Early diagnosis and treatment of Pompe disease are considered to be critical for maximum efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 20).	1
[Incidence of A1555G mutations in the mitochondrial DNA and 35delG in the GJB2 gene (connexin-26) in families with late onset non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss from Cantabria]. || Adolescent Adult Aged Catchment Area (Health) Child Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Female Gene Deletion Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Point Mutation Spain || Sensorineural deafness is a very common disorder in humans, which affects approximately 10% of the population. Genetic causes are suggested to be responsible for more than half of the cases. The A1555G mutation in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene and the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene are the most common mutations for sensorineural deafness in the Spanish population. A genetic study was carried out in order to determine the frequency of the mutations A1555G in the mitochondrial DNA and 35delG in the connexin-26 gene in 21 patients from 21 non-consanguineous unrelated families affected by late-onset bilateral non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss from Cantabria. The A1555G mutation was found in 6 patients. Five of these 6 patients had been treated with aminoglycosides. In all of them the auditory impairment affected mainly the high frequencies. The 35delG mutation was not found in any of the patients. The A1555G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA has been found to be the most common amongst the Cantabrian population. The A1555G mutation should be suspected in those members of families affected by sensorineural hearing impairment with a maternal inheritance pattern and ototoxicity from treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics. The 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene does not seem to be a major cause of deafness in families with late-onset non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss in our area.	4
The D313Y variant in the GLA gene - no evidence of a pathogenic role in Fabry disease. || Adult Aged Cells, Cultured Child DNA Mutational Analysis Fabry Disease Female Fibroblasts Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Leukocytes Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree X Chromosome Inactivation alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease is an X- linked inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GLA gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). The possible pathological significance of the D313Y variant in the GLA gene has not been verified and it may be a Fabry variant. Our aim was to elucidate whether the presence of the D313Y variant influenced the α-Gal A activity or resulted in Fabry symptoms or Fabry organ involvement. In two Danish families the presence of the D313Y variant did not result in reduced α-Gal A activity or clinical Fabry manifestations in males, and the presence in Fabry females did not significantly enhance the phenotype of a known causative mutation in the GLA gene (G271S). Our findings indicate that the D313Y variant is not causative to nor enhancing Fabry disease phenotype. The D313Y variant in the GLA gene was not disease causative in 2 Danish families. Investigating male family members were crucial in excluding the Fabry phenotype, and thus very important for proper genetic counceling of all family members, as well as overdiagnosing a devastating genetic disease.	4
CRISPR/Cas9 editing in human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes highlights arrhythmias, hypocontractility, and energy depletion as potential therapeutic targets for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ||  || Sarcomeric gene mutations frequently underlie hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a prevalent and complex condition leading to left ventricle thickening and heart dysfunction. We evaluated isogenic genome-edited human pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CM) for their validity to model, and add clarity to, HCM. CRISPR/Cas9 editing produced 11 variants of the HCM-causing mutation c.C9123T-MYH7 [(p.R453C-β-myosin heavy chain (MHC)] in 3 independent hPSC lines. Isogenic sets were differentiated to hPSC-CMs for high-throughput, non-subjective molecular and functional assessment using 12 approaches in 2D monolayers and/or 3D engineered heart tissues. Although immature, edited hPSC-CMs exhibited the main hallmarks of HCM (hypertrophy, multi-nucleation, hypertrophic marker expression, sarcomeric disarray). Functional evaluation supported the energy depletion model due to higher metabolic respiration activity, accompanied by abnormalities in calcium handling, arrhythmias, and contraction force. Partial phenotypic rescue was achieved with ranolazine but not omecamtiv mecarbil, while RNAseq highlighted potentially novel molecular targets. Our holistic and comprehensive approach showed that energy depletion affected core cardiomyocyte functionality. The engineered R453C-βMHC-mutation triggered compensatory responses in hPSC-CMs, causing increased ATP production and αMHC to energy-efficient βMHC switching. We showed that pharmacological rescue of arrhythmias was possible, while MHY7: MYH6 and mutant: wild-type MYH7 ratios may be diagnostic, and previously undescribed lncRNAs and gene modifiers are suggestive of new mechanisms.	4
The tumor suppressor capability of p53 is dependent on non-muscle myosin IIA function in head and neck cancer. || TP53 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma non-muscle myosin IIA tumor suppressor || Over 300,000 patients develop squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) worldwide with 25-30% of patients ultimately dying from their disease. Currently, molecular biomarkers are not used in HNSCC but several genes have been identified including mutant TP53 (mutp53). Our recent work has identified an approach to stratify patients with tumors harboring high or low risk TP53 mutations. Non-muscle Myosin IIA (NMIIA) was recently identified as a tumor suppressor in HNSCC. We now demonstrate that low MYH9 expression is associated with decreased survival in patients with head and neck cancer harboring low-risk mutp53 but not high-risk mutp53. Furthermore, inhibition of NMIIA leads to increased invasion in cells harboring wildtype p53 (wtp53), which was not observed in high-risk mutp53 cells. This increased invasiveness of wtp53 following NMIIA inhibition was associated with reduced p53 target gene expression and was absent in cells expressing mutp53. This reduced expression may be due, in part, to a decrease in nuclear localization of wtp53. These findings suggest that the tumor suppressor capability of wtp53 is dependent upon functional NMIIA and that the invasive phenotype of high-risk mutp53 is independent of NMIIA.	0
Absence of truncating BRIP1 mutations in chromosome 17q-linked hereditary prostate cancer families. || Aged Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17 DNA-Binding Proteins Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins Female Genetic Linkage Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Prostatic Neoplasms RNA Helicases || In a genome-wide scan (GWS) of 175 multiplex prostate cancer (PCa) families from the University of Michigan Prostate Cancer Genetics Project (PCGP), linkage was observed to markers on chromosome 17q21-24, a region that includes two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRIP1. BRIP1 is a Fanconi anaemia gene (FANCJ) that interacts with the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and has a role in DNA damage repair. Protein truncating mutations in BRIP1 have been identified in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families, and a recent report suggested that a recurrent truncating mutation (R798X) may have a role in PCa susceptibility. We examined the role of BRIP1 mutations in hereditary PCa through sequence analysis of 94 individuals from PCGP families showing linkage to 17q. A total of 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including 7 missense variants but no protein truncating mutations, were observed. The data presented here suggest that BRIP1 truncating mutations are uncommon in PCa cases and do not account for the linkage to chromosome 17q observed in our GWS. Additional investigation is needed to determine the significance, if any, of the observed BRIP1 missense variants in hereditary PCa.	4
The rs1803274 polymorphism of the BCHE gene is associated with an increased risk of coronary in-stent restenosis. || Aged Alleles Butyrylcholinesterase Coronary Restenosis Female Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Risk Factors Stents || We sought to identify gene polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to in-stent restenosis after coronary artery bare-metal stenting in a Central European population. 160 controls without post-percutaneous coronary intervention in-stent restenosis were matched for age, sex, vessel diameter, and diabetes to 160 consecutive cases involving in-stent restenosis of the target lesion within 12 months. Using real time polymerase chain reaction and melting-curve analysis, we detected 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 11 candidate genes - rs1803274 (BCHE gene), rs529038 (ROS1), rs1050450 (GPX1), rs1800849 (UCP3), rs17216473 (ALOX5AP), rs7412, rs429358 (ApoE), rs2228570 (VDR), rs7041, rs4588 (GC), rs1799986 (LRP1) and rs2228671 (LDLR). Multivariable logistic regression was used to test for associations. The rs1803274 polymorphism of BCHE was significantly associated with in-stent restenosis (OR 1.934; 95 % CI: 1.181-3.166; p = 0.009). No association was found with the other studied SNPs. The A allele of rs1803274 represents a risk factor for in-stent restenosis in Central European patients after percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent implantation.	4
Keratin23 (KRT23) knockdown decreases proliferation and affects the DNA damage response of colon cancer cells. || Base Sequence Blotting, Western Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Colonic Neoplasms DNA Damage DNA Methylation DNA Repair DNA-Binding Proteins Gamma Rays Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells HEK293 Cells Humans Keratins, Type I MRE11 Homologue Protein Microscopy, Fluorescence Molecular Sequence Data Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis RNA Interference Rad51 Recombinase Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Transcriptome || Keratin 23 (KRT23) is strongly expressed in colon adenocarcinomas but absent in normal colon mucosa. Array based methylation profiling of 40 colon samples showed that the promoter of KRT23 was methylated in normal colon mucosa, while hypomethylated in most adenocarcinomas. Promoter methylation correlated with absent expression, while increased KRT23 expression in tumor samples correlated with promoter hypomethylation, as confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. Demethylation induced KRT23 expression in vitro. Expression profiling of shRNA mediated stable KRT23 knockdown in colon cancer cell lines showed that KRT23 depletion affected molecules of the cell cycle and DNA replication, recombination and repair. In vitro analyses confirmed that KRT23 depletion significantly decreased the cellular proliferation of SW948 and LS1034 cells and markedly decreased the expression of genes involved in DNA damage response, mainly molecules of the double strand break repair homologous recombination pathway. KRT23 knockdown decreased the transcript and protein expression of key molecules as e.g. MRE11A, E2F1, RAD51 and BRCA1. Knockdown of KRT23 rendered colon cancer cells more sensitive to irradiation and reduced proliferation of the KRT23 depleted cells compared to irradiated control cells.	0
A Pilot Study of Clinical Targeted Next Generation Sequencing for Prostate Cancer: Consequences for Treatment and Genetic Counseling. || Aged Genetic Counseling Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Pilot Projects Prostatic Neoplasms Treatment Outcome || Targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) is increasingly used in oncology for therapeutic decision-making, but is not yet widely used for prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to determine current clinical utility of tNGS for prostate cancer management. Seven academic genitourinary medical oncologists recruited and consented patients with prostate cancer, largely with unusual clinical and/or pathologic features, from 2013 to 2015. UW-OncoPlex was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumors and/or metastatic biopsies. Results were discussed at a multidisciplinary precision tumor board prior to communicating to patients. FFPE tumor DNA was extracted for tNGS analysis of 194 cancer-associated genes. Results, multidisciplinary discussion, and treatment changes were recorded. Forty-five patients consented and 42 had reportable results. Findings included mutations in genes frequently observed in prostate cancer. We also found alterations in genes where targeted treatments were available and/or in clinical trials. 4/42 (10%) cases, change in treatment directly resulted from tNGS and multidisciplinary discussion. In 30/42 (71%) cases additional options were available but not pursued and/or were pending. Notably, 10/42 (24%) of patients harbored suspected germline mutations in moderate or high-penetrance cancer risk genes, including BRCA2, TP53, ATM, and CHEK2. One patient's tumor had bi-allelic MSH6 mutation and microsatellite instability. In total, 34/42 (81%) cases resulted in some measure of treatment actionability. Limitations include small size and limited clinical outcomes. Targeted NGS tumor sequencing may help guide immediate and future treatment options for men with prostate cancer. A substantial subset had germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes with potential clinical management implications for men and their relatives.

A limited spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations is observed in phenylketonuria patients in western Poland and implications for treatment with 6R tetrahydrobiopterin. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Biopterin Child Child, Preschool Female Gene Frequency Genotype Humans Infant Male Mutation Pedigree Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Poland Young Adult || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive defect in hepatic metabolism of phenylalanine, which is secondary to mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Sixty-seven ethnically Polish PKU patients, followed at the Outpatient Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Medicine in Poznan, Poland, were assessed for mutations in the PAH gene. Two mutations were identified in 61 of 67 patients and a single mutation was identified in the remaining six patients. The four most prevalent mutations (p.R408W, 68%; c.1066-11G>A, 6%; c.1315+1G>A, 5.2%; c.822-832delGCCCATGTATA, 3.7%) accounted for 83% of the mutant alleles. Fifteen additional mutations were identified of which most (13/15) were observed in an individual patient. Before knowledge of PAH genotypes, 19 patients were challenged with a 20 mg kg(-1) dose of 6R tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) and serum phenylalanine concentration was monitored in hospital over 24 h. Two patients responded to the BH(4) challenge with a reduction of serum phenylalanine concentration >30% from baseline. PAH genotypes of the two responsive patients would have been predicted, as they contained mutations recognized as BH(4) responsive, whereas the 17 patients who were unresponsive would have been predicted as their mutations were either recognized as non-responsive or were highly deleterious frame-shift mutations. Overall, only 7.5% (5/ 67) of patients had PAH mutations recognized as responsive to co-factor therapy. Among the PKU patients from western Poland, PAH mutations responsive to BH(4) therapy are poorly represented; therefore, genotyping may be useful for identifying candidate patients likely to respond to BH(4) before physiological challenge.	1 3
Restoring p53 active conformation by zinc increases the response of mutant p53 tumor cells to anticancer drugs. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Carrier Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Immunoprecipitation DNA-Binding Proteins Female Humans Mice Mice, Nude Mutation Nuclear Proteins Protein Conformation Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Transplantation, Heterologous Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins Zinc || Absence of p53 expression or expression of mutant p53 (mtp53) are common in human cancers and are associated with increased cancer resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Therefore, significant efforts towards pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway. We previously reported that, in HIPK2 knockdown background, p53 undergoes misfolding with inhibition of DNA binding and transcriptional activities that correlate with increased chemoresistance, and that zinc rescues wild-type p53 activity. Zinc has a crucial role in the biology of p53, in that p53 binds to DNA through a structurally complex domain stabilized by zinc atom. In this study, we explored the role of zinc in p53 reactivation in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells. We found that zinc re-established chemosensitivity in breast cancer SKBR3 (expressing R175H mutation) and glioblastoma U373MG (expressing R273H mutation) cell lines. Biochemical studies showed that zinc partly induced the transition of mutant p53 protein (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb240 antibody for mutant conformation) into a functional conformation (reactive to conformation-sensitive PAb1620 antibody for wild-type conformation). Zinc-mediated p53 reactivation also reduced the mtp53/p73 interaction restoring both wtp53 and p73 binding to target gene promoters by ChIP assay with in vivo induction of wtp53 target gene expression, which rendered mutant p53 cells more prone to drug killing in vitro. Finally, zinc administration in U373MG tumor xenografts increased drug-induced tumor regression in vivo, which correlated with increased wild-type p53 protein conformation. These results show that the use of zinc might restore drug sensitivity and inhibit tumor growth by reactivating mutant p53.	0
Modulating Beta-Cardiac Myosin Function at the Molecular and Tissue Levels. ||  || Inherited cardiomyopathies are a common form of heart disease that are caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins with beta cardiac myosin (MYH7) being one of the most frequently affected genes. Since the discovery of the first cardiomyopathy associated mutation in beta-cardiac myosin, a major goal has been to correlate thein vitro myosin motor properties with the contractile performance of cardiac muscle. There has been substantial progress in developing assays to measure the force and velocity properties of purified cardiac muscle myosin but it is still challenging to correlate results from molecular and tissue-level experiments. Mutations that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are more common than mutations that lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and are also often associated with increased isometric force and hyper-contractility. Therefore, the development of drugs designed to decrease isometric force by reducing the duty ratio (the proportion of time myosin spends bound to actin during its ATPase cycle) has been proposed for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Para-Nitroblebbistatin is a small molecule drug proposed to decrease the duty ratio of class II myosins. We examined the impact of this drug on human beta cardiac myosin using purified myosin motor assays and studies of permeabilized muscle fiber mechanics. We find that with purified human beta-cardiac myosin para-Nitroblebbistatin slows actin-activated ATPase andin vitro motility without altering the ADP release rate constant. In permeabilized human myocardium, para-Nitroblebbistatin reduces isometric force, power, and calcium sensitivity while not changing shortening velocity or the rate of force development (ktr). Therefore, designing a drug that reduces the myosin duty ratio by inhibiting strong attachment to actin while not changing detachment can cause a reduction in force without changing shortening velocity or relaxation.	4
Next-generation-sequencing-based identification of familial hypercholesterolemia-related mutations in subjects with increased LDL-C levels in a latvian population. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Apolipoprotein B-100 Cholesterol, LDL Cohort Studies Coronary Artery Disease Female Genetics, Population High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Latvia Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Receptors, LDL Serine Endopeptidases Young Adult || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the commonest monogenic disorders, predominantly inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. When untreated, it results in early coronary heart disease. The vast majority of FH remains undiagnosed in Latvia. The identification and early treatment of affected individuals remain a challenge worldwide. Most cases of FH are caused by mutations in one of four genes, APOB, LDLR, PCSK9, or LDLRAP1. The spectrum of disease-causing variants is very diverse and the variation detection panels usually used in its diagnosis cover only a minority of the disease-causing gene variants. However, DNA-based tests may provide an FH diagnosis for FH patients with no physical symptoms and with no known family history of the disease. Here, we evaluate the use of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify cases of FH in a cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and individuals with abnormal low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. We used targeted amplification of the coding regions of LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDLRAP1, followed by NGS, in 42 CAD patients (LDL-C, 4.1-7.2 mmol/L) and 50 individuals from a population-based cohort (LDL-C, 5.1-9.7 mmol/L). In total, 22 synonymous and 31 nonsynonymous variants, eight variants in close proximity (10 bp) to intron-exon boundaries, and 50 other variants were found. We identified four pathogenic mutations (p.(Arg3527Gln) in APOB, and p.(Gly20Arg), p.(Arg350*), and c.1706-10G > A in LDLR) in seven patients (7.6 %). Three possible pathogenic variants were also found in four patients. NGS-based methods can be used to detect FH in high-risk individuals when they do not meet the defined clinical criteria.	4
Analysis of several BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a hospital-based series of unselected breast cancer cases. ||  || The distribution of BRCA mutations varies significantly between populations. The spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast cancers in the Romanian population is incompletely known. The aim of the present study is to investigate the presence of nine BRCA mutations in patients with breast cancer identified in a surgical clinic from Bucharest. Unrelated women diagnosed with breast cancer from Coltea Hospital (n=114) and healthy controls (n = 150) were selected for this study. Seven mutations in BRCA1 (185delAG, 5382insC, 943ins10, E1250X, 1294del40, E1373X, R1443X) and two in BRCA2 (IVS16-2A4G and 6174delT) were tested using PCR based protocols. In addition, the presence of BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC, BRCA2 6174delT mutations were tested with a post amplification mutation detection system, based on the ELISA method. Two patients with sporadic breast cancer (2%) and one patient with family history of the disease (7.14%) have the BRCA1 5382insC mutation. No other mutation was detected in patient and control groups. The mutations were not present in the control lot. Our results indicate that BRCA1 5382insC is a common mutation in Romanian women with breast cancer (3 114).	4
Melanoma in congenital melanocytic naevi. || Brain Neoplasms Child Child, Preschool Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Infant Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mosaicism Mutation Nevus, Pigmented Risk Factors Skin Neoplasms || Congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN) are a known risk factor for melanoma, with the greatest risk currently thought to be in childhood. There has been controversy over the years about the incidence of melanoma, and therefore over the clinical management of CMN, due partly to the difficulties of histological diagnosis and partly to publishing bias towards cases of malignancy. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that melanoma risk in childhood is related to the severity of the congenital phenotype. New understanding of the genetics of CMN offers the possibility of improvement in diagnosis of melanoma, identification of those at highest risk, and new treatment options. We review the world literature and our centre's experience over the last 25 years, including the molecular characteristics of melanoma in these patients and new melanoma incidence and outcome data from our prospective cohort. Management strategies are proposed for presentation of suspected melanoma of the skin and the central nervous system in patients with CMN, including use of oral mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors in NRAS-mutated tumours.	4
ZBP-89 promotes growth arrest through stabilization of p53. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Division Cell Line Cell Nucleus DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Mice Nuclear Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Transcription Factors Transcriptional Activation Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc Fingers || Transcription factor p53 can induce growth arrest and/or apoptosis in cells through activation or repression of downstream target genes. Recently, we reported that ZBP-89 cooperates with histone acetyltransferase coactivator p300 in the regulation of p21(waf1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor whose associated gene is a target gene of p53. Therefore, we examined whether ZBP-89 might also inhibit cell growth by activating p53. In the present study, we demonstrate that elevated levels of ZBP-89 induce growth arrest and apoptosis in human gastrointestinal cell lines. The ZBP-89 protein accumulated within 4 h, and the p53 protein accumulated within 16 h, of serum starvation without changes in p14ARF levels, demonstrating a physiological increase in the cellular levels of these two proteins. Overexpression of ZBP-89 stabilized the p53 protein and enhanced its transcriptional activity through direct protein-protein interactions. The DNA binding and C-terminal domains of p53 and the zinc finger domain of ZBP-89 mediated the interaction. A point mutation in the p53 DNA binding domain, R273H, greatly reduced ZBP-89-mediated stabilization but not their physical interaction. Furthermore, ZBP-89 formed a complex with p53 and MDM2 and therefore did not prevent the MDM2-p53 interaction. However, heterokaryon assays demonstrated that ZBP-89 retained p53 in the nucleus. Collectively, these data indicate that ZBP-89 regulates cell proliferation in part through its ability to directly bind the p53 protein and retard its nuclear export. Our findings further our understanding of how ZBP-89 modulates cell proliferation and reveals a novel mechanism by which the p53 protein is stabilized.	0
Understanding intellectual disability through RASopathies. || Animals Humans Intellectual Disability Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Models, Biological Mutation Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Intellectual disability, commonly known as mental retardation in the International Classification of Disease from World Health Organization, is the term that describes an intellectual and adaptive cognitive disability that begins in early life during the developmental period. Currently the term intellectual disability is the preferred one. Although our understanding of the physiological basis of learning and learning disability is poor, a general idea is that such condition is quite permanent. However, investigations in animal models suggest that learning disability can be functional in nature and as such reversible through pharmacology or appropriate learning paradigms. A fraction of the cases of intellectual disability is caused by point mutations or deletions in genes that encode for proteins of the RAS/MAP kinase signaling pathway known as RASopathies. Here we examined the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this group of genetic disorders focusing in studies which provide evidence that intellectual disability is potentially treatable and curable. The evidence presented supports the idea that with the appropriate understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, intellectual disability could be treated pharmacologically and perhaps through specific mechanistic-based teaching strategies.	0
A novel common large genomic deletion and two new missense mutations identified in the Romanian phenylketonuria population. || Cell Line, Transformed Female Humans Male Mutation, Missense Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Romania Sequence Deletion || The mutation spectrum for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene was investigated in a cohort of 84 hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) patients from Romania identified through newborn screening or neurometabolic investigations. Differential diagnosis identified 81 patients with classic PAH deficiency while 3 had tetrahydropterin-cofactor deficiency and/or remained uncertain due to insufficient specimen. PAH-genetic analysis included a combination of Sanger sequencing of exons and exon–intron boundaries, MLPA and NGS with genomic DNA, and cDNA analysis from immortalized lymphoblasts. A diagnostic efficiency of 99.4% was achieved, as for one allele (out of a total of 162 alleles) no mutation could be identified. The most prevalent mutation was p.Arg408Trp which was found in ~ 38% of all PKU alleles. Three novel mutations were identified, including the two missense mutations p.Gln226Lys and p.Tyr268Cys that were both disease causing by prediction algorithms, and the large genomic deletion EX6del7831 (c.509 + 4140_706 + 510del7831) that resulted in skipping of exon 6 based on PAH-cDNA analysis in immortalized lymphocytes. The genomic deletion was present in a heterozygous state in 12 patients, i.e. in ~ 8% of all the analyzed PKU alleles, and might have originated from a Romanian founder.	1 3
Analysis of sequence variations in low-density lipoprotein receptor gene among Malaysian patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. || Adult Alternative Splicing Amino Acid Substitution Base Sequence Cardiovascular Diseases Cholesterol Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Exons Female Gene Deletion Gene Rearrangement Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Lipoproteins, LDL Malaysia Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense Phenotype Promoter Regions, Genetic Receptors, LDL Sequence Analysis, DNA Xanthomatosis || Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder mainly caused by defects in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. Few and limited analyses of familial hypercholesterolemia have been performed in Malaysia, and the underlying mutations therefore remain largely unknown.We studied a group of 154 unrelated FH patients from a northern area of Malaysia (Kelantan). The promoter region and exons 2-15 of the LDLR gene were screened by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to detect short deletions and nucleotide substitutions, and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect large rearrangements. A total of 29 gene sequence variants were reported in 117(76.0%) of the studied subjects. Eight different mutations (1 large rearrangement, 1 short deletion, 5 missense mutations, and 1 splice site mutation), and 21 variants. Eight gene sequence variants were reported for the first time and they were noticed in familial hypercholesterolemic patients, but not in controls (p.Asp100Asp, p.Asp139His, p.Arg471Gly, c.1705+117 T>G, c.1186+41T>A, 1705+112C>G, Dup exon 12 and p.Trp666ProfsX45). The incidence of the p.Arg471Gly variant was 11%. Patients with pathogenic mutations were younger, had significantly higher incidences of cardiovascular disease, xanthomas, and family history of hyperlipidemia, together with significantly higher total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein levels than patients with non-pathogenic variants. Twenty-nine gene sequence variants occurred among FH patients; those with predicted pathogenicity were associated with higher incidences of cardiovascular diseases, tendon xanthomas, and higher total and low density lipoprotein levels compared to the rest. These results provide preliminary information on the mutation spectrum of this gene among patients with FH in Malaysia.	4
Among 45 variants in 11 genes, HDM2 promoter polymorphisms emerge as new candidate biomarker associated with radiation toxicity. ||  || Due to individual variations in radiosensitivity, biomarkers are needed to tailor radiation treatment to cancer patients. Since single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequent in human, we hypothesized that SNPs in genes that mitigate the radiation response are associated with radiotoxicity, in particular late complications to radiotherapy and could be used as genetic biomarkers for radiation sensitivity. A total of 155 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer were included in the study. Normal tissue fibrosis was scored using RTOG/EORTC grading system. Eleven candidate genes (ATM, XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC4, XRCC5, PRKDC, LIG4, TP53, HDM2, CDKN1A, TGFB1) were selected for their presumed influence on radiosensitivity. Forty-five SNPs (12 primary and 33 neighboring) were genotyped by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. Patients with severe fibrosis (cases, G3-4, n = 48) were compared to controls (G0-2, n = 107). Results showed statistically significant (P < 0.05) association with radiation complications for six SNPs (ATM G/A rs1801516, HDM2 promoter T/G rs2279744 and T/A rs1196333, XRCC1 G/A rs25487, XRCC5 T/C rs1051677 and TGFB1 C/T rs1800469). We conclude that these six SNPs are candidate genetic biomarkers for radiosensitivity in our patients that have cumulative effects as patients with severe fibrosis harbored significantly higher number of risk alleles than the controls (P < 0.001). Larger cohort, independent replication of these findings and genome-wide association studies are required to confirm these results in order for SNPs to be used as biomarkers to individualize radiotherapy on genetic basis.	4
Clinical Validation of Targeted Next Generation Sequencing for Colon and Lung Cancers. ||  || Recently, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has begun to supplant other technologies for gene mutation testing that is now required for targeted therapies. However, transfer of NGS technology to clinical daily practice requires validation. We validated the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Colon and Lung cancer panel interrogating 1850 hotspots in 22 genes using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. First, we used commercial reference standards that carry mutations at defined allelic frequency (AF). Then, 51 colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) and 39 non small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) were retrospectively analyzed. Sensitivity and accuracy for detecting variants at an AF >4% was 100% for commercial reference standards. Among the 90 cases, 89 (98.9%) were successfully sequenced. Among the 86 samples for which NGS and the reference test were both informative, 83 showed concordant results between NGS and the reference test; i.e. KRAS and BRAF for CRC and EGFR for NSCLC, with the 3 discordant cases each characterized by an AF <10%. Overall, the AmpliSeq colon/lung cancer panel was specific and sensitive for mutation analysis of gene panels and can be incorporated into clinical daily practice.	4
Comprehensive diagnostic battery for evaluating sensorineural hearing loss in children. || Brain Child Connexin 26 Connexins Ear Canal Electrocardiography Female Fluorescent Treponemal Antibody-Absorption Test Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Hearing Tests Humans Kidney Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Retrospective Studies Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Temporal Bone Tomography, X-Ray Computed Ultrasonics Ultrasonography Vision Disorders Vision Tests || Selection of diagnostic tests for children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is influenced by clinical suspicion. Testing results reported in the literature are similarly biased. We evaluate the usefulness of a comprehensive diagnostic battery for each child. Retrospective review. Tertiary care university hospital. A total of 270 children referred for severe to profound SNHL between January 2002 and June 2009. Results of the following were reviewed: magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, renal ultrasound, electrocardiography, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, connexin 26 sequencing, genetic consultation, and ophthalmologic consultation. Diagnostic yield of each test was determined. Each diagnostic test or consultation was completed by at least 95% of patients for whom it was ordered. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities explaining SNHL in 24% of patients. Computed tomography showed inner ear anomalies in 18% of patients. Biallelic connexin 26 mutations were found in 15%. Renal ultrasound found anomalies in 4% of patients. Electrocardiography found 1% of patients with prolonged QT intervals. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test result was positive in 0.5%. Genetic consultation found a genetic cause for hearing loss in 25%. Ophthalmologic consultation found abnormalities associated with hearing loss in 8%. Diagnostic radiologic imaging is the highest yielding test for evaluating children with SNHL. Connexin 26 sequencing identifies a nearly nonoverlapping subset of children compared with imaging. Specialty consultations, particularly from a clinical geneticist, can improve diagnostic yield. Other tests, although of lower diagnostic yield for SNHL, can identify important diseases that significantly affect patient health.	4
Mutational landscape reflects the biological continuum of plasma cell dyscrasias. || Aged Cohort Studies Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Paraproteinemias Prognosis || We subjected 90 patients covering a biological spectrum of plasma cell dyscrasias (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and multiple myeloma) to next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel analysis on unsorted bone marrow. A total of 64 different mutations in 8 genes were identified in this cohort. NRAS (28.1%), KRAS (21.3%), TP53 (19.5%), BRAF (19.1%) and CCND1 (8.9%) were the most commonly mutated genes in all patients. Patients with non-myeloma plasma cell dyscrasias showed a significantly lower mutational load than myeloma patients (0.91±0.30 vs 2.07±0.29 mutations per case, P=0.008). KRAS and NRAS exon 3 mutations were significantly associated with the myeloma cohort compared with non-myeloma plasma cell dyscrasias (odds ratio (OR) 9.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-90.72, P=0.043 and OR 7.03, 95% CI 1.49-33.26, P=0.014). NRAS exon 3 and TP53 exon 6 mutations were significantly associated with del17p cytogenetics (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.87, P=0.036 and OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.54, P=0.013). Our data show that the mutational landscape reflects the biological continuum of plasma cell dyscrasias from a low-complexity mutational pattern in MGUS and AL amyloidosis to a high-complexity pattern in multiple myeloma. Our targeted NGS approach allows resource-efficient, sensitive and scalable mutation analysis for prognostic, predictive or therapeutic purposes.	4
A case of multiple angiomas without any angiokeratomas in a female heterozygote with Fabry disease. || Angiokeratoma Fabry Disease Female Genetic Carrier Screening Hemangioma Heterozygote Humans Leukocytes Male Middle Aged Skin Neoplasms alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease is a rare, X-chromosome-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficient alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. The disease manifests primarily in affected hemizygous males and to some extent in heterozygous females ('carrier'). A 45-year-old female Fabry disease patient without angiokeratomas but with numerous angiomas is presented. Her leukocyte alpha-galactosidase A activity was reduced (0.35 nmol/min/mg protein; normal range: 0.4-1). The analysis of her alpha-galactosidase A gene (exon 1-7) showed the transition c.427 G>A. An intrafamilial follow-up search detected a reduced leukocyte alpha-galactosidase A activity in her father, who suffered exclusively from coronary heart disease. Our case report underlines the possible wide range of clinical signs in Fabry disease patients, sometimes complicated by missing typical lesions (e.g. angiokeratomas). In oligosymptomatic Fabry disease cases, genetic analysis is recommended.	3
Evaluation of variants in the CHEK2, BRIP1 and PALB2 genes in an Irish breast cancer cohort. || Adult Base Sequence Breast Neoplasms Checkpoint Kinase 2 Cohort Studies DNA-Binding Proteins Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Ireland Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Nuclear Proteins Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases RNA Helicases Tumor Suppressor Proteins || It has been proposed that rare variants within the double strand break repair genes CHEK2, BRIP1 and PALB2 predispose to breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these variants in an Irish breast cancer cohort and determine their contribution to the development of breast cancer in the west of Ireland. We evaluated the presence of CHEK2_1100delC variant in 903 breast cancer cases and 1,016 controls. Six previously described variants within BRIP1 and five within PALB2 were screened in 192 patients with early-onset or familial breast cancer. Where a variant was evident, it was then examined in the remainder of our 711 unselected breast cancer cases. CHEK2_1100delC was found in 5/903 (0.5%) breast cancer cases compared to 1/1016 (0.1%) controls. One mutation at BRIP1 (2392 C>T) was identified in the early-onset/familial cohort. Examination of this variant in the remainder of our cohort (711 cases) failed to identify any additional cases. None of the previously described PALB2 variants were demonstrated in the early-onset/familial cohort. We show evidence of CHEK2_1100delC and BRIP1 2392 C>T within the Irish population. CHEK2_1100delC and BRIP1 mutations incidence in Ireland is similar to that found in other unselected breast cancer cohorts from northern European countries. We found no evidence to suggest that PALB2 mutation is an important breast cancer predisposition gene in this population.	4
[The mutation analysis of PAH gene and prenatal diagnosis in classical phenylketonuria family]. ||  || To characterize the mutation spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and perform prenatal diagnosis for families with classical phenylketonuria. By stratified sequencing, mutations were detected in the exons and flaking introns of PAH gene of 44 families with classical phenylketonuria. 47 fetuses were diagnosed by combined sequencing with linkage analysis of three common short tandem repeats (STR) (PAH-STR, PAH-26 and PAH-32) in the PAH gene. Thirty-one types of mutations were identified. A total of 84 mutations were identified in 88 alleles (95.45%), in which the most common mutation have been R243Q (21.59%), EX6-96A>G (6.82%), IVS4-1G>A (5.86%) and IVS7+2T>A (5.86%). Most mutations were found in exons 3, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12. The polymorphism information content (PIC) of these three STR markers was 0.71 (PAH-STR), 0.48 (PAH-26) and 0.40 (PAH-32), respectively. Prenatal diagnosis was performed successfully with the combined method in 47 fetuses of 44 classical phenylketonuria families. Among them, 11 (23.4%) were diagnosed as affected, 24 (51.1%) as carriers, and 12 (25.5%) as unaffected. Prenatal diagnosis can be achieved efficiently and accurately by stratified sequencing of PAH gene and linkage analysis of STR for classical phenylketonuria families.	1 3
ErbB2 inhibition by lapatinib promotes degradation of mutant p53 protein in cancer cells. || Animals Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Down-Regulation Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Lapatinib Mice Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proteolysis Quinazolines Receptor, ErbB-2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most prevalent genetic events in human Her2-positive breast cancer and are associated with poor prognosis and survival. Human clinical data and our in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggest potent oncogenic cooperation between mutant p53 and Her2 (ErbB2). Yet, the translational significance of mutant p53 in Her2 positive breast cancer, especially with respect to Her2-targeted therapies, has not been evaluated. Our previous work identified novel oncogenic activity of mutant p53 whereby mutp53 amplifies ErbB2 signaling via the mutp53-HSF1-ErbB2 feed-forward loop. Here we report that pharmacological interception of this circuit by ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib downregulates mutant p53 in vitro and in vivo. We found that ErbB2 inhibition by lapatinib inhibits transcription factor HSF1, and its target Hsp90, followed by mutant p53 degradation in MDM2 dependent manner. Thus, our data suggest that mutant p53 sensitizes cancer cells to lapatinib via two complementary mechanisms: mutant p53 mediated amplification of ErbB2 signaling, and simultaneous annihilation of both potent oncogenic drivers, ErbB2 and mutant p53. Hence, our study could provide valuable information for the optimization of therapeutic protocols to achieve superior clinical effects in the treatment of Her2 positive breast cancer.	0
MEK targeting in N-RAS mutated metastatic melanoma. || Aged Benzimidazoles Blotting, Western Female Genes, ras Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Proportional Hazards Models Protein Kinase Inhibitors Tumor Cells, Cultured || Gain of function mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS occur frequently in melanoma, leading to mitogen activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and this pathway is the target of drugs in development. Our purpose was to study clinical characteristics of patients with mutations in this pathway and to determine activity of inhibitors of B-RAF and MEK in short term cultures grown from tumors of some of these patients. Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively on melanoma patients tested for B-RAF and N-RAS mutations at the Yale Cancer Center and associations with survival were determined. We studied in vitro activity of the pan-RAF inhibitor, RAF265, and the MEK inhibitor, MEK162, in 22 melanoma short term cultures. We further characterized the effect of MEK inhibition on apoptosis and growth of melanoma cultures. In a cohort of 144 metastatic melanoma patients we found that patients with N-RAS mutant melanoma had a worse prognosis. These patients were more likely to have brain metastases at the time of presentation with metastatic disease than their N-RAS-wild-type counterparts. All N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures tested in our study (n = 7) were sensitive to MEK inhibition 162. Exposure to MEK162 reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and induced apoptosis. Clonogenic survival was significantly reduced in sensitive melanoma cell cultures. The prognosis of patients with melanoma expressing constitutively active N-RAS is poor, consistent with studies performed at other institutions. N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures appear to be particularly sensitive to MEK162, supporting ongoing clinical trials with MEK162 in N-RAS mutated melanoma.	0
SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G varies among Chinese ethnic groups as a cause of hearing loss. ||  || Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are second only to GJB2 mutations as a currently identifiable genetic cause of sensorineural hearing loss. In most areas of China, genetic testing for sensorineural hearing loss is unavailable because of limited knowledge of the mutation spectrum. Although SLC26A4 c.919-2A>G (IVS7-2A>G) is a common mutation among some Asian populations, the mutation prevalence among various ethnic groups within China has not been studied. DNA specimens from 3271 subjects with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss from 27 regions of China were genotyped for the c.919-2A>G mutation by polymerase chain reaction/restriction-fragment-length polymorphism. Normal hearing controls from Han (n = 185) and Uigur (n = 152) populations were also tested. Overall, 408 subjects with sensorineural hearing loss (12.5%) carried at least one c.919-2A>G allele, with 158 (4.8%) homozygotes and 250 (7.6%) heterozygotes. Within the subpopulations examined, the rate varies from 0% to 12.2% for c.919-2A>G homozygotes and from 0% to 17.6% for heterozygotes. Based on this cohort, Chinese subjects with sensorineural hearing loss seem to have a relatively higher c.919-2A>G frequency than that of other Asian populations. These results demonstrate that a simple and efficient genetic test for the c.919-2A>G mutation alone would identify the molecular cause in up to 8-12% of individuals with sensorineural hearing loss in a few eastern and central regions of China. Those who are negative for the c.919-2A>G mutation would be candidates for further mutational analysis of SLC26A4 or other deafness-related genes. This would greatly improve genetic diagnosis and counseling for a huge number of Chinese individuals and family members with sensorineural hearing loss in China, and many more ethnic Chinese in other countries, which might be up to one million.	4
[Application of MALDI-TOF-MS in gene testing for non-syndromic hearing loss]. ||  || To investigate the feasibility of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) , according to the genetic test of non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL), and check using the direct sequencing. Peripheral blood was collected from 454 NSHL patients. DNA samples were extracted and 20 loci of the four common disease-causing genes were analysed by MALDI-TOF-MS, including GJB2 (35delG, 167delT, 176_191del16, 235delC, 299_300delAT ), GJB3 (538C→T, 547G→A), SLC26A4 (281C→T, 589G→A, IVS7-2A→G, 1174A→T, 1226G→A, 1229C→T, IVS15+5G→A, 1975G→C, 2027T→A, 2162C→T, 2168A→G), and mitochondrial 12S rRNA (1494C→T, 1555A→G). Direct sequencing was also used to analyse the aforementioned 20 loci in order to validate the accuracy of MALDI-TOF-MS. Among the 454 patients, 166 cases (36.56%) of disease-causing mutations were detected, which included 69 cases (21.15%) of GJB2 gene mutation, four cases (0.88%) of GJB3 gene mutation, 64 cases (14.10%) of SLC26A4 gene mutation, and three cases (0.66%) of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene mutation. Moreover, the results obtained from direct sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS were consistent, and the results showed that the two methods were consistent. The MALDI-TOF-MS detection method was designed based on the hearing loss-related mutation hotspots seen in the Chinese population, and it has a high detection rate for NSHL related mutations. In comparison to the conventional detection methods, MALDI-TOF-MS has the following advantages: more detection sites, greater coverage, accurate, high throughput and low cost. Therefore, this method is capable of satisfying the needs of clinical detection for hearing impairment and it is suitable for large-scale implementation.	4

However the importance of this event in disease pathogenesis and its implications for therapy are uncertain. We used genomic sequencing to examine the involvement of TSC1 in bladder cancer, and signalling pathway analysis and small-molecule screening to identify targeted therapeutic strategies in TSC1 mutant bladder cancer cell lines. TSC1 loss of heterozygosity was seen in 54% of bladder cancers. Two (4.9%) of these 41 bladder cancers had TSC1 mutations by exon-based sequencing. Analysis of 27 bladder cancer cell lines demonstrated inactivating TSC1 mutations in three: RT-4, HCV29, 97-1. Interestingly, only RT-4 showed classic feedback inhibition of AKT, and was highly sensitive to treatment with mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and Torin1. 97-1 cells showed constitutive EGFR activation, and were highly sensitive to combined treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Torin1 and EGFR inhibitors Lapatinib or Afatinib. A BRAF missense mutation G469V was found in HCV29 cells, and AKT activation was dependent on BRAF, but independent of ERK. A kinase inhibitor screen of HCV29 cells showed strong growth inhibition by the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922, and we then found synergistic inhibitory effects of NVP-AUY922 combined with either Torin1 or rapamycin on cell survival for both HCV29 and 97-1 cells. In aggregate, these findings indicate that there are highly variable mutation profiles and signalling pathway activation in TSC1-mutant bladder cancer. Furthermore, combined Hsp90/mTOR inhibition is a promising therapeutic approach for TSC1 mutant bladder cancer.	0
Targeted massively parallel sequencing of angiosarcomas reveals frequent activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Enzyme Activation Female Hemangiosarcoma Humans Male Middle Aged Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Prognosis Risk Factors Signal Transduction || Angiosarcomas are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors of endothelial differentiation. The clinical behavior is usually aggressive and the prognosis for patients with advanced disease is poor with no effective therapies. The genetic bases of these tumors have been partially revealed in recent studies reporting genetic alterations such as amplifications of MYC (primarily in radiation-associated angiosarcomas), inactivating mutations in PTPRB and R707Q hotspot mutations of PLCG1. Here, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of 34 angiosarcomas using a clinically-approved, hybridization-based targeted next-generation sequencing assay for 341 well-established oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Over half of the angiosarcomas (n = 18, 53%) harbored genetic alterations affecting the MAPK pathway, involving mutations in KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MAPK1 and NF1, or amplifications in MAPK1/CRKL, CRAF or BRAF. The most frequently detected genetic aberrations were mutations in TP53 in 12 tumors(35%) and losses of CDKN2A in9 tumors (26%). MYC amplifications were generally mutually exclusive of TP53 alterations and CDKN2A loss and were identified in 8 tumors (24%), most of which (n = 7, 88%) arose post-irradiation. Previously reported mutations in PTPRB (n = 10, 29%) and one (3%) PLCG1 R707Q mutation were also identified. Our results demonstrate that angiosarcomas are a genetically heterogeneous group of tumors, harboring a wide range of genetic alterations. The high frequency of genetic events affecting the MAPK pathway suggests that targeted therapies inhibiting MAPK signaling may be promising therapeutic avenues in patients with advanced angiosarcomas.	4
Frequency of aortic dilation in Noonan syndrome. || Adolescent Adult Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic Child Echocardiography Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Infant Male New York Noonan Syndrome Retrospective Studies Young Adult || Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations altering proteins relevant to RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction. Cardiac involvement is common, most prevalently pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Because abnormal mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling contributes to the aortopathy in Marfan syndrome and with rare reports of aortic aneurysm in NS, we undertook a retrospective study of ascending aortic anatomy in 37 patients with NS and without confounding medical conditions. Age ranged from 0.6 to 32 years. Based on the most recent echocardiogram, the aortic annulus and root were dilated in the cohort (mean z scores of 1.14 and 0.98, respectively, p <0.005) but the sinotubular junction and ascending aorta were not (mean z scores of 0.05 and 0.19, respectively). The aortic root was aneurysmal (>2 z scores) in 8 subjects (21.6%). PTPN11 mutations were present in 14 subjects, whose aortic status was similar to the cohort overall. Comparison of age and z scores revealed a modest tendency for the aortic annulus and root to dilate over time. Among 13 subjects with multiple imaging studies over an average of 6.8 years, the average z score increased to 0.78 and 0.39 for the aortic annulus and root, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that age accounted for 7.0% and 11.0% of the variance in the aortic annular and root diameters, respectively. In conclusion, we found that aortic annular dilation and aortic root aneurysm are prevalent in NS, often presenting during childhood and progressing over time. Further study is needed to identify potential risks associated with these abnormalities.	4
TP53 disruptive mutations lead to head and neck cancer treatment failure through inhibition of radiation-induced senescence. || Aging Animals Apoptosis Blotting, Western Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Fluorescent Antibody Technique Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans Immunoenzyme Techniques Mice Mutation Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Radiation Tolerance Reactive Oxygen Species Survival Rate Treatment Failure Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mortality of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is primarily driven by tumor cell radioresistance leading to locoregional recurrence (LRR). In this study, we use a classification of TP53 mutation (disruptive vs. nondisruptive) and examine impact on clinical outcomes and radiation sensitivity. Seventy-four patients with HNSCC treated with surgery and postoperative radiation and 38 HNSCC cell lines were assembled; for each, TP53 was sequenced and the in vitro radioresistance measured using clonogenic assays. p53 protein expression was inhibited using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and overexpressed using a retrovirus. Radiation-induced apoptosis, mitotic cell death, senescence, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were carried out. The effect of the drug metformin on overcoming mutant p53-associated radiation resistance was examined in vitro as well as in vivo, using an orthotopic xenograft model. Mutant TP53 alone was not predictive of LRR; however, disruptive TP53 mutation strongly predicted LRR (P = 0.03). Cell lines with disruptive mutations were significantly more radioresistant (P < 0.05). Expression of disruptive TP53 mutations significantly decreased radiation-induced senescence, as measured by SA-β-gal staining, p21 expression, and release of ROS. The mitochondrial agent metformin potentiated the effects of radiation in the presence of a disruptive TP53 mutation partially via senescence. Examination of our patient cohort showed that LRR was decreased in patients taking metformin. Disruptive TP53 mutations in HNSCC tumors predicts for LRR, because of increased radioresistance via the inhibition of senescence. Metformin can serve as a radiosensitizer for HNSCC with disruptive TP53, presaging the possibility of personalizing HNSCC treatment.	0
Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 cause melorheostosis. || Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 Bone and Bones Calcification, Physiologic Cell Differentiation Cell Proliferation Gene Expression Regulation Humans MAP Kinase Kinase 1 Melorheostosis Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Mosaicism Mutation Osteoblasts Osteogenesis Primary Cell Culture Signal Transduction Skin Whole Exome Sequencing || Melorheostosis is a sporadic disease of uncertain etiology characterized by asymmetric bone overgrowth and functional impairment. Using whole exome sequencing, we identify somatic mosaic MAP2K1 mutations in affected, but not unaffected, bone of eight unrelated patients with melorheostosis. The activating mutations (Q56P, K57E and K57N) cluster tightly in the MEK1 negative regulatory domain. Affected bone displays a mosaic pattern of increased p-ERK1/2 in osteoblast immunohistochemistry. Osteoblasts cultured from affected bone comprise two populations with distinct p-ERK1/2 levels by flow cytometry, enhanced ERK1/2 activation, and increased cell proliferation. However, these MAP2K1 mutations inhibit BMP2-mediated osteoblast mineralization and differentiation in vitro, underlying the markedly increased osteoid detected in affected bone histology. Mosaicism is also detected in the skin overlying bone lesions in four of five patients tested. Our data show that the MAP2K1 oncogene is important in human bone formation and implicate MEK1 inhibition as a potential treatment avenue for melorheostosis.	0
Melanomas acquire resistance to B-RAF(V600E) inhibition by RTK or N-RAS upregulation. || Base Sequence Cell Line, Tumor Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Enzyme Activation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, ras Humans Indoles MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta Sulfonamides Up-Regulation Vemurafenib || Activating B-RAF(V600E) (also known as BRAF) kinase mutations occur in ∼7% of human malignancies and ∼60% of melanomas. Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways. Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRβ (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRβ RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFRβ-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFRβ or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRβ or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.	0
Functional and mutational landscapes of BRCA1 for homology-directed repair and therapy resistance. || Antineoplastic Agents BRCA1 Protein Base Pairing Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded DNA Repair Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Homologous Recombination Humans Mutant Proteins Phthalazines Piperazines || BRCA1 plays a critical role in homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double strand breaks, and the repair defect of BRCA1-mutant cancer cells is being targeted with platinum drugs and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. We have employed relatively simple and sensitive assays to determine the function of BRCA1 variants or mutants in two HDR mechanisms, homologous recombination (HR) and single strand annealing (SSA), and in conferring resistance to cisplatin and olaparib in human cancer cells. Our results define the functionality of the top 22 patient-derived BRCA1 missense variants and the contribution of different domains of BRCA1 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to HDR and drug resistance. Importantly, our results also demonstrate that the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction dictates the choice between HR and SSA. These studies establish functional and mutational landscapes of BRCA1 for HDR and therapy resistance, while revealing novel insights into BRCA1 regulatory mechanisms and HDR pathway choice.	0
Investigation of Five Common Mutations on Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene of Phenylketonuria Patients from Two Provinces in North of Iran. || Mutation phenylalanine hydroxylase phenylketonuria || There are more than 500 different mutations on phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene that is responsible for phenylketonuria (PKU) diseases and the spectrum of these mutations is varied in different populations. The main clinical manifestation of untreated patients is severe mental retardation. The PAH gene, that is 90 kb long, is consisted of 13 exons and 12 introns. The aim of the present study was to identify the frequency of five common mutations on PAH gene among patients with PKU in Mazandaran and Golestan provinces including c.1066-11G>A, p. R261Q, p. R252W, p. R261X, and c.1200 + 1G>C. Forty unrelated PKU patients, that 22 of them, were from Mazandaran and 18 of them from Golestan provinces were enrolled in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes using Qiagen DNA extraction kit and polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism method was applied to detect five common mutations. Three out of the 5 investigate mutations were identified among the patients. The c.1066-11G>A mutation has the highest frequency (27.5%) among the patients and the frequency of p. R261Q and p. R261X mutations were 3.75 and 1.25%, respectively. In Golestan province, only c.1066-11G>A mutation was observed in investigated alleles. The high frequency of c.1066-11G>A mutation in Golestan province may be related to genetic drift, founder effect, and consanguinity.	1 3
Modulation of the ribonucleotide reductase-antimetabolite drug interaction in cancer cell lines. ||  || RRM1 is a determinant of gemcitabine efficacy in cancer patients. However, the precision of predicting tumor response based on RRM1 levels is not optimal. We used gene-specific overexpression and RNA interference to assess RRM1's impact on different classes of cytotoxic agents, on drug-drug interactions, and the modulating impact of other molecular and cellular parameters. RRM1 was the dominant determinant of gemcitabine efficacy in various cancer cell lines. RRM1 also impacted the efficacy of other antimetabolite agents. It did not disrupt the interaction of two cytotoxic agents when combined. Cell lines with truncation, deletion, and null status of p53 were resistant to gemcitabine without apparent relationship to RRM1 levels. Pemetrexed and carboplatin sensitivity did not appear to be related to p53 mutation status. The impact of p53 mutations in patients treated with gemcitabine should be studied in prospective clinical trials to develop a model with improved precision of predicting drug efficacy.	0
Crude Extracts, Flavokawain B and Alpinetin Compounds from the Rhizome of Alpinia mutica Induce Cell Death via UCK2 Enzyme Inhibition and in Turn Reduce 18S rRNA Biosynthesis in HT-29 Cells. || Alpinia Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Proliferation DNA Fragmentation Down-Regulation Enzyme Inhibitors Flavanones Flavonoids HT29 Cells Humans Mitochondria Plant Extracts Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 RNA, Messenger RNA, Ribosomal, 18S Rhizome Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Uridine Kinase || Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 is an enzyme that is overexpressed in abnormal cell growth and its implication is considered a hallmark of cancer. Due to the selective expression of UCK2 in cancer cells, a selective inhibition of this key enzyme necessitates the discovery of its potential inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy. The present study was carried out to demonstrate the potentials of natural phytochemicals from the rhizome of Alpinia mutica to inhibit UCK2 useful for colorectal cancer. Here, we employed the used of in vitro to investigate the effectiveness of natural UCK2 inhibitors to cause HT-29 cell death. Extracts, flavokawain B, and alpinetin compound from the rhizome of Alpinia mutica was used in the study. The study demonstrated that the expression of UCK2 mRNA were substantially reduced in treated HT-29 cells. In addition, downregulation in expression of 18S ribosomal RNA was also observed in all treated HT-29 cells. This was confirmed by fluorescence imaging to measure the level of expression of 18S ribosomal RNA in live cell images. The study suggests the possibility of MDM2 protein was downregulated and its suppression subsequently activates the expression of p53 during inhibition of UCK2 enzyme. The expression of p53 is directly linked to a blockage of cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase and upregulates Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase 3 while Bcl2 was deregulated. In this respect, apoptosis induction and DNA fragmentation were observed in treated HT-29 cells. Initial results from in vitro studies have shown the ability of the bioactive compounds of flavokawain B and alpinetin to target UCK2 enzyme specifically, inducing cell cycle arrest and subsequently leading to cancer cell death, possibly through interfering the MDM2-p53 signalling pathway. These phenomena have proven that the bioactive compounds could be useful for future therapeutic use in colon cancer.	0

Mutation of NRAS is a rare genetic event in ovarian low-grade serous carcinoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Baltimore Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma Cell Proliferation DNA Mutational Analysis Denmark Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Mutation Rate Neoplasm Grading Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Staging Neoplasms, Cystic, Mucinous, and Serous Ovarian Neoplasms Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Young Adult || Activating mutations involving the members of the RAS signaling pathway, including KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF, have been reported in ovarian low-grade serous carcinoma and its precursor lesion, serous borderline tumor (SBT). Whether additional genetic alterations in the RAS oncogene family accumulate during the progression of SBT to invasive low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) remains largely unknown. Although mutations of KRAS and BRAF occur at a very early stage of progression, even preceding the development of SBT, additional driving events, such as NRAS mutations, have been postulated to facilitate progression. In this study, we analyzed NRAS exon 3 mutational status in 98 cases that were diagnosed with SBT/atypical proliferative serous tumor, noninvasive LGSC, or invasive LGSC. Of the latter, NRAS Q61R (CAA to CGA) mutations were detected in only 2 of 56 (3.6%) cases. The same mutation was not detected in any of the SBTs (atypical proliferative serous tumors) or noninvasive LGSCs. Mutational analysis for hotspots in KRAS and BRAF demonstrated a wild-type pattern of KRAS and BRAF in one of the NRAS-mutated cases. Interestingly, another LGSC case with NRAS mutation harbored a concurrent BRAF V600L mutation. These findings indicate that, although recurrent NRAS mutations are present, their low prevalence indicates that NRAS plays a limited role in the development of LGSC. Further studies to identify other oncogenic events that drive LGSC progression are warranted.	4
Characterization of the endoribonuclease active site of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1. || Base Sequence Binding Sites Catalytic Domain DNA DNA Repair DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Endoribonucleases Humans Hydrolysis Kinetics Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Protein Binding Protein Conformation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc RNA Recombinant Proteins Substrate Specificity || Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is the major mammalian enzyme in DNA base excision repair that cleaves the DNA phosphodiester backbone immediately 5' to abasic sites. Recently, we identified APE1 as an endoribonuclease that cleaves a specific coding region of c-myc mRNA in vitro, regulating c-myc mRNA level and half-life in cells. Here, we further characterized the endoribonuclease activity of APE1, focusing on the active-site center of the enzyme previously defined for DNA nuclease activities. We found that most site-directed APE1 mutant proteins (N68A, D70A, Y171F, D210N, F266A, D308A, and H309S), which target amino acid residues constituting the abasic DNA endonuclease active-site pocket, showed significant decreases in endoribonuclease activity. Intriguingly, the D283N APE1 mutant protein retained endoribonuclease and abasic single-stranded RNA cleavage activities, with concurrent loss of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site cleavage activities on double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The mutant proteins bound c-myc RNA equally well as wild-type (WT) APE1, with the exception of H309N, suggesting that most of these residues contributed primarily to RNA catalysis and not to RNA binding. Interestingly, both the endoribonuclease and the ssRNA AP site cleavage activities of WT APE1 were present in the absence of Mg(2+), while ssDNA AP site cleavage required Mg(2+) (optimally at 0.5-2.0 mM). We also found that a 2'-OH on the sugar moiety was absolutely required for RNA cleavage by WT APE1, consistent with APE1 leaving a 3'-PO(4)(2-) group following cleavage of RNA. Altogether, our data support the notion that a common active site is shared for the endoribonuclease and other nuclease activities of APE1; however, we provide evidence that the mechanisms for cleaving RNA, abasic single-stranded RNA, and abasic DNA by APE1 are not identical, an observation that has implications for unraveling the endoribonuclease function of APE1 in vivo.	0

He received direct injections into his heart of autologous precursor cells isolated from his blood. He immediately suffered ventricular fibrillation. Although he was resuscitated, he experienced a prolonged downward course that prohibited his undergoing transplantation. His autopsy revealed marked fibrosis throughout the myocardium with areas of mononuclear cell infiltrate. This case highlights the potential adverse effects associated with intramyocardial therapy in the cardiomyopathic heart.	4
Misfolding, Aggregation, and Disordered Segments in c-Abl and p53 in Human Cancer. ||  || The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer is not sufficient to explain the loss or gain of function in proteins related to tumorigenic processes. Among them, more than 100 oncogenes, 20-30 tumor-suppressor genes, and hundreds of genes participating in DNA repair and replication have been found to play a role in the origins of cancer over the last 25 years. The phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues is a critical step in cellular growth and development and is achieved through the tight regulation of protein kinases. Phosphorylation plays a major role in eukaryotic signaling as kinase domains are found in 2% of our genes. The deregulation of kinase control mechanisms has disastrous consequences, often leading to gains of function, cell transformation, and cancer. The c-Abl kinase protein is one of the most studied targets in the fight against cancer and is a hotspot for drug development because it participates in several solid tumors and is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Tumor suppressors have the opposite effects. Their fundamental role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has awarded them a role as the guardians of DNA. Among the tumor suppressors, p53 is the most studied. The p53 protein has been shown to be a transcription factor that recognizes and binds to specific DNA response elements and activates gene transcription. Stress triggered by ionizing radiation or other mutagenic events leads to p53 phosphorylation and cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or programed cell death. The p53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain are classified as class I or class II depending on whether substitutions occur in the DNA contact sites or in the protein core, respectively. Tumor-associated p53 mutations often lead to the loss of protein function, but recent investigations have also indicated gain-of-function mutations. The prion-like aggregation of mutant p53 is associated with loss-of-function, dominant-negative, and gain-of-function effects. In the current review, we focused on the most recent insights into the protein structure and function of the c-Abl and p53 proteins that will provide us guidance to understand the loss and gain of function of these misfolded tumor-associated proteins.	0
Screening for Fabry Disease by Urinary Globotriaosylceramide Isoforms Measurement in Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Echocardiography Fabry Disease Female Glycolipids Humans Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular Male Mass Spectrometry Middle Aged Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization Trihexosylceramides alpha-Galactosidase || Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a frequent echocardiographic feature in Fabry disease (FD) and in severe cases may be confused with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) of other origin. The prevalence of FD in patients primarily diagnosed with HCM varies considerably in screening and case finding studies, respectively. In a significant proportion of patients, presenting with only mild or moderate LVH and unspecific clinical signs FD may remain undiagnosed. Urinary Gb3 isoforms have been shown to detect FD in both, women and men. We examined whether this non-invasive method would help to identify new FD cases in a non-selected cohort of patients with various degree of LVH. Consecutive patients older than 18 years with a diastolic interventricular septal wall thickness of ≥12mm determined by echocardiography were included. Referral diagnosis was documented and spot urine was collected. Gb3 was measured by mass spectroscopy. Subjects with an elevated Gb3-24:18 ratio were clinically examined for signs of FD, α-galactosidase-A activity in leukocytes was determined and GLA-mutation-analysis was performed. We examined 2596 patients. In 99 subjects urinary Gb3 isoforms excretion were elevated. In these patients no new cases of FD were identified by extended FD assessment. In two of three patients formerly diagnosed with FD Gb3-24:18 ratio was elevated and would have led to further diagnostic evaluation. Measurement of urinary Gb3 isoforms in a non-selected cohort with LVH was unable to identify new cases of FD. False positive results may be prevented by more restricted inclusion criteria and may improve diagnostic accuracy of this method.	4
CDH1 germ-line missense mutation identified by multigene sequencing in a family with no history of diffuse gastric cancer. || Adult Aged Antigens, CD Breast Neoplasms Cadherins Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Testing Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Mutation, Missense Stomach Neoplasms || Germ-line mutation in CDH1 gene is associated with high risk for Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) and Infiltrative Lobular Carcinoma (ILC). Although somatic CDH1 mutations were also detected in ILC with a frequency ranging from 10 to 56%, CDH1 alterations in more frequent infiltrative ductal carcinoma (IDC) appear to be rare, and no association with germ-line CDH1 mutation and IDC has been established. Here we report the case of a woman diagnosed with IDC at 39years of age, presenting extensive familial history of cancer at multiple sites with early-age onset and with no case of HDGC. Deep sequencing have revealed CDH1 missense mutation c.1849G>A (p.Ala617Thr) in heterozygous and four BRCA2 single nucleotide polymorphism in homozygosis. In this family, the mutation c.1849G>A in the CDH1 gene is not related to HDGC nor ILC. Therefore, here we highlight that multigene analysis is important to detect germ-line mutations and genetic variants in patients with cancers at multiple sites in the family, even if inconclusive genetic counseling can be offered, since hereafter, medical awareness will be held.	4
Role of corin in the regulation of blood pressure. || Animals Atrial Natriuretic Factor Blood Pressure Female Heart Diseases Humans Hypertension Kidney Kidney Diseases Pre-Eclampsia Pregnancy Proprotein Convertases Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor Serine Endopeptidases || Corin is a transmembrane protease that activates atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), an important hormone in regulating salt-water balance and blood pressure. This review focuses on the regulation of corin function and potential roles of corin defects in hypertensive, heart, and renal diseases. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-6 has been identified as a primary enzyme that converts zymogen corin to an active protease. Genetic variants that impair corin intracellular trafficking, cell surface expression, and zymogen activation have been found in patients with hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and pre-eclampsia. Reduced corin expression has been detected in animal models of cardiomyopathies and in human failing hearts. Low levels of circulating soluble corin have been reported in patients with heart disease and stroke. Corin, ANP and natriuretic peptide receptor-A mRNAs, and proteins have been colocalized in human renal segments, suggesting a corin-ANP autocrine function in the kidney. Corin is a key enzyme in the natriuretic peptide system. The latest findings indicate that corin-mediated ANP production may act in a tissue-specific manner to regulate cardiovascular and renal function. Corin defects may contribute to major diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, pre-eclampsia, and kidney disease.	0
Targeting the p53 Pathway in Ewing Sarcoma. ||  || The p53 tumour suppressor plays a pivotal role in the prevention of oncogenic transformation. Cancers frequently evade the potent antitumour surveillance mechanisms of p53 through mutation of the TP53 gene, with approximately 50% of all human malignancies expressing dysfunctional, mutated p53 proteins. Interestingly, genetic lesions in the TP53 gene are only observed in 10% of Ewing Sarcomas, with the majority of these sarcomas expressing a functional wild-type p53. In addition, the p53 downstream signaling pathways and DNA-damage cell cycle checkpoints remain functionally intact in these sarcomas. This paper summarizes recent insights into the functional capabilities and regulation of p53 in Ewing Sarcoma, with a particular focus on the cross-talk between p53 and the EWS-FLI1 gene rearrangement frequently associated with this disease. The development of several activators of p53 is discussed, with recent evidence demonstrating the potential of small molecule p53 activators as a promising systemic therapeutic approach for the treatment of Ewing Sarcomas with wild-type p53.	0
PIPKIγ regulates β-catenin transcriptional activity downstream of growth factor receptor signaling. || Cadherins Cell Nucleus Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockdown Techniques HeLa Cells Humans Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor) Protein Transport RNA, Small Interfering Receptors, Growth Factor Signal Transduction Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Transfection beta Catenin || Increased β-catenin transcriptional activity downstream of the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway has been observed in many human tumors, most notably colorectal carcinomas. However, β-catenin activation is also observed in many human malignancies with no observable Wnt activity. Wnt-independent pathways that activate β-catenin remain undefined, yet have the potential to play a significant role during tumorigenesis. Here, we report that phosphotidylinositol phosphate kinase Iγ (PIPKIγ), an enzyme that generates phosphoinositide messengers in vivo, directly associates with β-catenin and increases β-catenin activity downstream of growth factor stimulation. PIPKIγ expression and kinase activity enhance β-catenin phosphorylation on residues that promote nuclear importation and transcriptional activity. Lastly, we show that β-catenin is required for PIPKIγ-dependent increased cell proliferation. These results reveal a novel mechanism in which PIPKIγ expression and catalytic activity enhance β-catenin nuclear translocation and expression of its target genes to promote tumorigenic phenotypes.	0
Periostin cooperates with mutant p53 to mediate invasion through the induction of STAT1 signaling in the esophageal tumor microenvironment. ||  || Periostin (POSTN), a matricellular protein, has been reported to be important in supporting tumor cell dissemination. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying POSTN function within the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. In this study, we observe that the inducible knockdown of POSTN decreases esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumor growth in vivo and demonstrate that POSTN cooperates with a conformational missense p53 mutation to enhance invasion. Pathway analyses reveal that invasive esophageal cells expressing POSTN and p53(R175H) mutation display activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) target genes, suggesting that the induction of STAT1 and STAT1-related genes could foster a permissive microenvironment that facilitates invasion of esophageal epithelial cells into the extracellular matrix. Genetic knockdown of STAT1 in transformed esophageal epithelial cells underscores the importance of STAT1 in promoting invasion. Furthermore, we find that STAT1 is activated in ESCC xenograft tumors, but this activation is attenuated with inducible knockdown of POSTN in ESCC tumors. Overall, these results highlight the novel molecular mechanisms supporting the capacity of POSTN in mediating tumor invasion during ESCC development and have implications of therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment.	0
Functional analysis of a duplication (p.E63_D69dup) in the switch II region of HRAS: new aspects of the molecular pathogenesis underlying Costello syndrome. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adolescent Animals Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Costello Syndrome Female GTPase-Activating Proteins Gene Duplication Germ-Line Mutation Humans Intellectual Disability MAP Kinase Signaling System Mice Neurofibromin 1 Pathology, Molecular Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction || Costello syndrome is a congenital disorder comprising a characteristic face, severe feeding difficulties, skeletal, cardiac and skin abnormalities, intellectual disability and predisposition to malignancies. It is caused by heterozygous germline HRAS mutations mostly affecting Gly(12) or Gly(13), which impair HRAS-GTPase activity and result in increased downstream signal flow independent of incoming signals. Functional analyses of rarer HRAS mutations identified in individuals with attenuated Costello syndrome phenotypes revealed altered GDP/GTP nucleotide affinities (p.K117R) and inefficient effector binding (p.E37dup). Thus, both phenotypic and functional variability associated with HRAS mutations are evident. Here, we report on a novel heterozygous HRAS germline mutation (c.187_207dup, p.E63_D69dup) in a girl presenting with a phenotype at the milder end of the Costello syndrome spectrum. The p.E63_D69dup mutation impaired co-precipitation of recombinant HRAS with NF1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) suggesting constitutive HRAS(E63_D69dup) activation due to GAP insensitivity. Indeed, we identified strongly augmented active HRAS(E63_D69dup) that co-precipitated with effectors RAF1, RAL guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator and phospholipase C1. However, we could not pull down active HRAS(E63_D69dup) using the target protein PIK3CA, indicating a compromised association between active HRAS(E63_D69dup) and PIK3CA. Accordingly, overexpression of HRAS(E63_D69dup) increased steady-state phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 downstream of RAF, whereas AKT phosphorylation downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was not enhanced. By analyzing signaling dynamics, we found that HRAS(E63_D69dup) has impaired reagibility to stimuli resulting in reduced and disrupted capacity to transduce incoming signals to the RAF-MAPK and PI3K-AKT cascade, respectively. We suggest that disrupted HRAS reagibility, as we demonstrate for the p.E63_D69dup mutation, is a previously unappreciated molecular pathomechanism underlying Costello syndrome.	0
Age-dependent penetrance of different germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene. || Adult Age of Onset Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Germ-Line Mutation Heterozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary Ovarian Neoplasms Pedigree Penetrance Survival Analysis || BRCA1 gene mutations have been extensively studied in relation to breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. Various genotype-phenotype correlation attempts have yielded important data pertaining to the consequences of BRCA1 mutations. However, little is known about the effects of recurrent BRCA mutations on expressivity and the age of onset of cancer in a population. This study addresses whether different exon mutations have variable expressivity especially in relation to the age of onset of breast cancer. Using a step-wise systematic approach, culminating in the sequencing of all BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons with the addition of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, the relationship between disease phenotypes and gene mutations in 219 individuals and their family members was examined. It is shown that different BRCA1 gene mutations have distinct effects that influence the age of onset of breast or ovarian cancer. Mutations in exon 2 of the BRCA1 gene had significantly lower penetrance compared with mutations of exons 11, 13 and 20. The median age of affliction with breast cancer was 55 years for 185delAG in exon 2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 46.7 to 59.5), 47 years for the 4184delTCAA mutation in exon 11 (95% CI 39 to 55.4), and 41 years for exon 13 duplication (95% CI 32.9 to 49.7) of the BRCA1 gene. Moreover, 14 novel mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the Yorkshire/Humberside population were identified. The 185delAG mutation of the BRCA1 gene is a low penetrance mutation that is age dependent especially when compared with the exon 13 duplication mutation. The data have important ramifications on screening, genetic counselling and prophylactic treatment of BRCA1 gene mutation carriers.	4
p53 and its mutants in tumor cell migration and invasion. || Animals Cell Movement Humans Mutant Proteins Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || In about half of all human cancers, the tumor suppressor p53 protein is either lost or mutated, frequently resulting in the expression of a transcriptionally inactive mutant p53 protein. Loss of p53 function is well known to influence cell cycle checkpoint controls and apoptosis. But it is now clear that p53 regulates other key stages of metastatic progression, such as cell migration and invasion. Moreover, recent data suggests that expression of mutant p53 is not the equivalent of p53 loss, and that mutant p53s can acquire new functions to drive cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, in part by interfering with p63 function.	0
RasIns: Genetically Encoded Intrabodies of Activated Ras Proteins. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Antibodies COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops Guanosine Diphosphate Guanosine Triphosphate High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Protein Conformation RNA, Messenger Signal Transduction ras Proteins || K- and H-Ras are the most commonly mutated genes in human tumors and are critical for conferring and maintaining the oncogenic phenotype in tumors with poor prognoses. Here, we design genetically encoded antibody-like ligands (intrabodies) that recognize active, GTP-bound K- and H-Ras. These ligands, which use the 10th domain of human fibronectin as their scaffold, are stable inside the cells and when fused with a fluorescent protein label, the constitutively active G12V mutant H-Ras. Primary selection of ligands against Ras with mRNA display resulted in an intrabody (termed RasIn1) that binds with a KD of 2.1μM to H-Ras(G12V) (GTP), excellent state selectivity, and remarkable specificity for K- and H-Ras. RasIn1 recognizes residues in the Switch I region of Ras, similar to Raf-RBD, and competes with Raf-RBD for binding. An affinity maturation selection based on RasIn1 resulted in RasIn2, which binds with a KD of 120nM and also retains excellent state selectivity. Both of these intrabodies colocalize with H-Ras, K-Ras, and G12V mutants inside the cells, providing new potential tools to monitor and modulate Ras-mediated signaling. Finally, RasIn1 and Rasin2 both display selectivity for the G12V mutants as compared with wild-type Ras providing a potential route for mutant selective recognition of Ras.	0
A benchmark for chromatin binding measurements in live cells. || Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching Humans Kinetics Spectrometry, Fluorescence Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Live-cell measurement of protein binding to chromatin allows probing cellular biochemistry in physiological conditions, which are difficult to mimic in vitro. However, different studies have yielded widely discrepant predictions, and so it remains uncertain how to make the measurements accurately. To establish a benchmark we measured binding of the transcription factor p53 to chromatin by three approaches: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and single-molecule tracking (SMT). Using new procedures to analyze the SMT data and to guide the FRAP and FCS analysis, we show how all three approaches yield similar estimates for both the fraction of p53 molecules bound to chromatin (only about 20%) and the residence time of these bound molecules (∼1.8 s). We also apply these procedures to mutants in p53 chromatin binding. Our results support the model that p53 locates specific sites by first binding at sequence-independent sites.	0
Human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. Characterization of the catalytic site. || Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence Binding Sites Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid DNA Mutational Analysis Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors Humans Inositol Lysosomes Molecular Sequence Data Oligonucleotides Peptide Fragments Protein Processing, Post-Translational Structure-Activity Relationship alpha-Glucosidases || The substrate analogue conduritol B epoxide (CBE) is demonstrated to be an active site-directed inhibitor of human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. A competitive mode of inhibition is obtained with glycogen as natural and 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside as artificial substrate. The inactivation of the enzyme is time and concentration dependent and results in the covalent binding of CBE. Catalytic activity is required for binding to occur. CBE-labeled peptides containing the catalytic residue of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase were isolated and identified by microsequencing and amino acid analysis. The peptides appeared to originate from a protein domain which is highly conserved among alpha-amylases, maltase, glucoamylases, and transglucanosylases. Based on the sequence similarity and the mechanism of CBE binding, Asp-518 is predicted to be the essential carboxylate in the active site of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. The functional importance of Asp-518 and other residues around the catalytic site was studied by expression of in vitro mutagenized alpha-glucosidase cDNA in transiently transfected COS cells. Substitution of Asp-513 by Glu-513 is shown to interfere with the posttranslational modification and the intracellular transport of the alpha-glucosidase precursor. The residues Trp-516 and Asp-518 are demonstrated to be critical for catalytic function.	0
Moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin induces S-phase arrest and augments apoptotic effects of cisplatin in human pancreatic cancer cells via ERK activation. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Ciprofloxacin Cisplatin Drug Synergism Fluoroquinolones Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Moxifloxacin Pancreatic Neoplasms S Phase || Pancreatic cancer, one of the most dreadful gastrointestinal tract malignancies, with the current chemotherapeutic drugs has posed a major impediment owing to poor prognosis and chemo-resistance thereby suggesting critical need for additional drugs as therapeutics in combating the situation. Fluoroquinolones have shown promising and significant anti-tumor effects on several carcinoma cell lines. Previously, we reported growth inhibitory effects of fourth generation fluoroquinolone Gatifloxacin, while in the current study we have investigated the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing mechanism of older generation fluoroquinolones Moxifloxacin and Ciprofloxacin on the pancreatic cancer cell-lines MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis induction was evaluated using annexin assay, cell cycle assay and activation of caspase-3, 8, 9 were measured by western blotting and enzyme activity assay. Herein, we found that both the fluoroquinolones suppressed the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells by causing S-phase arrest and apoptosis. Blockade in S-phase of cell cycle was associated with decrease in the levels of p27, p21, CDK2, cyclin-A and cyclin-E. Herein we also observed triggering of extrinsic as well as intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as suggested by the activation of caspase-8, 9, 3, and Bid respectively. All this was accompanied by downregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL and upregulation of proapoptotic protein Bak. Our results strongly suggest the role of extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), but not p53, p38 and c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) in fluoroquinolone induced growth inhibitory effects in both the cell lines. Additionally, we also found both the fluoroquinolones to augment the apoptotic effects of broad spectrum anticancer drug Cisplatin via ERK. The fact that these fluoroquinolones synergize the effect of cisplatin opens new insight into therapeutic index in treatment of pancreatic cancer.	0
The RAS-Effector Interaction as a Drug Target. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Genes, ras Humans Mutation Signal Transduction ras Proteins || About a third of all human cancers harbor mutations in one of the K-, N-, or HRAS genes that encode an abnormal RAS protein locked in a constitutively activated state to drive malignant transformation and tumor growth. Despite more than three decades of intensive research aimed at the discovery of RAS-directed therapeutics, there are no FDA-approved drugs that are broadly effective against RAS-driven cancers. Although RAS proteins are often said to be "undruggable," there is mounting evidence suggesting it may be feasible to develop direct inhibitors of RAS proteins. Here, we review this evidence with a focus on compounds capable of inhibiting the interaction of RAS proteins with their effectors that transduce the signals of RAS and that drive and sustain malignant transformation and tumor growth. These reports of direct-acting RAS inhibitors provide valuable insight for further discovery and development of clinical candidates for RAS-driven cancers involving mutations in RAS genes or otherwise activated RAS proteins.

NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a multifunctional antioxidant enzyme and exceptionally versatile cytoprotector. || Animals Antioxidants Estrogens Gene Knockdown Techniques Gene Knockout Techniques Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein 1 Models, Biological NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone) Oxidative Stress Polymorphism, Genetic Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Protein Binding Protein Stability Quinones Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a widely-distributed FAD-dependent flavoprotein that promotes obligatory 2-electron reductions of quinones, quinoneimines, nitroaromatics, and azo dyes, at rates that are comparable with NADH or NADPH. These reductions depress quinone levels and thereby minimize opportunities for generation of reactive oxygen intermediates by redox cycling, and for depletion of intracellular thiol pools. NQO1 is a highly-inducible enzyme that is regulated by the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway. Evidence for the importance of the antioxidant functions of NQO1 in combating oxidative stress is provided by demonstrations that induction of NQO1 levels or their depletion (knockout, or knockdown) are associated with decreased and increased susceptibilities to oxidative stress, respectively. Furthermore, benzene genotoxicity is markedly enhanced when NQO1 activity is compromised. Not surprisingly, human polymorphisms that suppress NQO1 activities are associated with increased predisposition to disease. Recent studies have uncovered protective roles for NQO1 that apparently are unrelated to its enzymatic activities. NQO1 binds to and thereby stabilizes the important tumor suppressor p53 against proteasomal degradation. Indeed, NQO1 appears to regulate the degradative fate of other proteins. These findings suggest that NQO1 may exercise a selective "gatekeeping" role in regulating the proteasomal degradation of specific proteins, thereby broadening the cytoprotective role of NQO1 far beyond its highly effective antioxidant functions.	0
A novel SND1-BRAF fusion confers resistance to c-Met inhibitor PF-04217903 in GTL16 cells through [corrected] MAPK activation. || Cell Line, Tumor Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Nuclear Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met Pyrazines Recombinant Fusion Proteins Triazoles || Targeting cancers with amplified or abnormally activated c-Met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) may have therapeutic benefit based on nonclinical and emerging clinical findings. However, the eventual emergence of drug resistant tumors motivates the pre-emptive identification of potential mechanisms of clinical resistance. We rendered a MET amplified gastric cancer cell line, GTL16, resistant to c-Met inhibition with prolonged exposure to a c-Met inhibitor, PF-04217903 (METi). Characterization of surviving cells identified an amplified chromosomal rearrangement between 7q32 and 7q34 which overexpresses a constitutively active SND1-BRAF fusion protein. In the resistant clones, hyperactivation of the downstream MAPK pathway via SND1-BRAF conferred resistance to c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition. Combination treatment with METi and a RAF inhibitor, PF-04880594 (RAFi) inhibited ERK activation and circumvented resistance to either single agent. Alternatively, treatment with a MEK inhibitor, PD-0325901 (MEKi) alone effectively blocked ERK phosphorylation and inhibited cell growth. Our results suggest that combination of a c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a BRAF or a MEK inhibitor may be effective in treating resistant tumors that use activated BRAF to escape suppression of c-Met signaling.	0
Mutant p53 shapes the enhancer landscape of cancer cells in response to chronic immune signaling. || Cell Line, Tumor Enhancer Elements, Genetic Humans Mutation NF-kappa B Neoplasms Protein Binding Transcriptional Activation Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Inflammation influences cancer development, progression, and the efficacy of cancer treatments, yet the mechanisms by which immune signaling drives alterations in the cancer cell transcriptome remain unclear. Using ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and GRO-seq, here we demonstrate a global overlap in the binding of tumor-promoting p53 mutants and the master proinflammatory regulator NFκB that drives alterations in enhancer and gene activation in response to chronic TNF-α signaling. We show that p53 mutants interact directly with NFκB and that both factors impact the other's binding at diverse sets of active enhancers. In turn, the simultaneous and cooperative binding of these factors is required to regulate RNAPII recruitment, the synthesis of enhancer RNAs, and the activation of tumor-promoting genes. Collectively, these findings establish a mechanism by which chronic TNF-α signaling orchestrates a functional interplay between mutant p53 and NFκB that underlies altered patterns of cancer-promoting gene expression.Inflammation is known to affect cancer development, yet the mechanisms by which immune signaling drives transformation remain unclear. Here, the authors provide evidence that chronic TNF-α signaling promotes the enhancer binding and transcriptional interplay between mutant p53 and NFκB.	0
BET inhibitor OTX015 targets BRD2 and BRD4 and decreases c-MYC in acute leukemia cells. || Acetanilides Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Female Fluorescent Antibody Technique Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring Humans Immunoblotting Leukemia Male Nuclear Proteins Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc RNA-Binding Proteins Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Transcription Factors Transcriptome || The bromodomain (BRD) and extraterminal (BET) proteins including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 have been identified as key targets for leukemia maintenance. A novel oral inhibitor of BRD2/3/4, the thienotriazolodiazepine compound OTX015, suitable for human use, is available. Here we report its biological effects in AML and ALL cell lines and leukemic samples. Exposure to OTX015 lead to cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at submicromolar concentrations in acute leukemia cell lines and patient-derived leukemic cells, as described with the canonical JQ1 BET inhibitor. Treatment with JQ1 and OTX15 induces similar gene expression profiles in sensitive cell lines, including a c-MYC decrease and an HEXIM1 increase. OTX015 exposure also induced a strong decrease of BRD2, BRD4 and c-MYC and increase of HEXIM1 proteins, while BRD3 expression was unchanged. c-MYC, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and HEXIM1 mRNA levels did not correlate however with viability following exposure to OTX015. Sequential combinations of OTX015 with other epigenetic modifying drugs, panobinostat and azacitidine have a synergic effect on growth of the KASUMI cell line. Our results indicate that OTX015 and JQ1 have similar biological effects in leukemic cells, supporting OTX015 evaluation in a Phase Ib trial in relapsed/refractory leukemia patients.	0
Familial progressive vestibulocochlear dysfunction caused by a COCH mutation (DFNA9). ||  || To describe the decline of vestibulocochlear function in a man with vestibulocochlear dysfunction caused by a Pro51Ser mutation within the COCH gene on chromosome 14q12-13 (DFNA9). A follow-up of more than 15 years was performed in a single case. Clinical investigations were supplemented by oculomotor, vestibular, and auditory tests. A 50-year-old man had had progressive sensorineural hearing loss and dysequilibrium for 15 years; he had been asymptomatic at the age of 35 years. He suffered from instability in the dark, head movement-dependent oscillopsia, paroxysmal positional vertigo, and vertigo with and without nausea. Hearing impairment started unilaterally, predominantly in the high frequencies. He also reported tinnitus. Disease progressed to severe bilateral high-frequency hearing impairment and vestibular areflexia. Fluctuation of vestibulocochlear function was documented and mentioned by the patient. Our patient proved to suffer from an autosomal dominant vestibulocochlear disorder caused by a COCH gene mutation. The remarkable medical history has some features in common with Meniere disease; however, there are also different clinical and neurophysiological features. In the family, phenotypic variability is present.	4
DNAJA1 controls the fate of misfolded mutant p53 through the mevalonate pathway. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Transformation, Neoplastic DNA HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins Humans Mevalonic Acid Mutation Protein Binding Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitination || Stabilization of mutant p53 (mutp53) in tumours greatly contributes to malignant progression. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic approaches to destabilize mutp53. Here, through high-throughput screening we identify statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs, as degradation inducers for conformational or misfolded p53 mutants with minimal effects on wild-type p53 (wtp53) and DNA contact mutants. Statins preferentially suppress mutp53-expressing cancer cell growth. Specific reduction of mevalonate-5-phosphate by statins or mevalonate kinase knockdown induces CHIP ubiquitin ligase-mediated nuclear export, ubiquitylation, and degradation of mutp53 by impairing interaction of mutp53 with DNAJA1, a Hsp40 family member. Knockdown of DNAJA1 also induces CHIP-mediated mutp53 degradation, while its overexpression antagonizes statin-induced mutp53 degradation. Our study reveals that DNAJA1 controls the fate of misfolded mutp53, provides insights into potential strategies to deplete mutp53 through the mevalonate pathway-DNAJA1 axis, and highlights the significance of p53 status in impacting statins' efficacy on cancer therapy.	0
[Clinical findings and mutational spectrum in Venezuelan patients with delayed diagnosis of phenylketonuria]. ||  || Massive neonatal screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) began in developed countries in 1963, and eventually disappeared as a cause of mental retardation. Yet, this is not the case in most developing countries. To describe the phenotype and the genotype of PKU patients with a delayed diagnosis in order to draw attention to the importance of neonatal studies and molecular diagnosis. Clinical data were collected from five unrelated patients by means of a medical assessment. The molecular study was conducted using the DGGE, sequencing and/or restriction analysis techniques to search for mutations in the PAH gene. RESULTS. Owing to the delayed diagnosis all the patients presented severe clinical manifestations, such as psychomotor retardation, atypical behaviours and language disorders. Four of them presented epilepsy and there were two cases of microcephaly. The phenotype was as expected, given the genotype. Seven different mutations were detected in the 10 alleles that were studied. The IVS10nt +5 g>t mutation was the most frequent, followed by the Venezuelan mutation S349L. Furthermore, two patients presented mutated proteins with residual activity, and good results were obtained using BH4 therapy. In our country, as in most developing countries, PKU neonatal studies are performed but the programme does not cover the whole neonatal population. In this work, we want to stress the importance of neonatal studies in the welfare of children, as well as the use of molecular diagnosis to improve the therapeutic orientation and genetic counselling of the families involved.	3
Clinical features and predictors for disease natural progression in adults with Pompe disease: a nationwide prospective observational study. || Adult Aged Disease Progression Female Glycogen Storage Disease Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies alpha-Glucosidases || Due partly to physicians' unawareness, many adults with Pompe disease are diagnosed with great delay. Besides, it is not well known which factors influence the rate of disease progression, and thus disease outcome. We delineated the specific clinical features of Pompe disease in adults, and mapped out the distribution and severity of muscle weakness, and the sequence of involvement of the individual muscle groups. Furthermore, we defined the natural disease course and identified prognostic factors for disease progression. We conducted a single-center, prospective, observational study. Muscle strength (manual muscle testing, and hand-held dynamometry), muscle function (quick motor function test), and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity in sitting and supine positions) were assessed every 3-6 months and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Between October 2004 and August 2009, 94 patients aged between 25 and 75 years were included in the study. Although skeletal muscle weakness was typically distributed in a limb-girdle pattern, many patients had unfamiliar features such as ptosis (23%), bulbar weakness (28%), and scapular winging (33%). During follow-up (average 1.6 years, range 0.5-4.2 years), skeletal muscle strength deteriorated significantly (mean declines of -1.3% point/year for manual muscle testing and of -2.6% points/year for hand-held dynamometry; both p<0.001). Longer disease duration (>15 years) and pulmonary involvement (forced vital capacity in sitting position <80%) at study entry predicted faster decline. On average, forced vital capacity in supine position deteriorated by 1.3% points per year (p=0.02). Decline in pulmonary function was consistent across subgroups. Ten percent of patients declined unexpectedly fast. Recognizing patterns of common and less familiar characteristics in adults with Pompe disease facilitates timely diagnosis. Longer disease duration and reduced pulmonary function stand out as predictors of rapid disease progression, and aid in deciding whether to initiate enzyme replacement therapy, or when.	1
Contribution of the TTC21B gene to glomerular and cystic kidney diseases. || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Disease Progression Female Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental Heterozygote Humans Kidney Diseases, Cystic Male Microtubule-Associated Proteins Mutation Pedigree || The TTC21B gene was initially described as causative of nephronophthisis (NPHP). Recently, the homozygous TTC21B p.P209L mutation has been identified in families with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and tubulointerstitial lesions. Heterozygous TTC21B variants have been proposed as genetic modifiers in ciliopathies. We aimed to study the causative and modifying role of the TTC21B gene in glomerular and cystic kidney diseases. Mutation analysis of the TTC21B gene was performed by massive parallel sequencing. We studied the causative role of the TTC21B gene in 17 patients with primary diagnosis of FSGS or NPHP and its modifying role in 184 patients with inherited glomerular or cystic kidney diseases. Disease-causing TTC21B mutations were identified in three families presenting nephrotic proteinuria with FSGS and tubulointerstitial lesions in which some family members presented hypertension and myopia. Two families carried the homozygous p.P209L and the third was compound heterozygous for the p.P209L and a novel p.H426D mutation. Rare heterozygous TTC21B variants predicted to be pathogenic were found in five patients. These TTC21B variants were significantly more frequent in renal patients compared with controls (P = 0.0349). Two patients with a heterozygous deleterious TTC21B variant in addition to the disease-causing mutation presented a more severe phenotype than expected. Our results confirm the causal role of the homozygous p.P209L TTC21B mutation in two new families with FSGS and tubulointerstitial disease. We identified a novel TTC21B mutation demonstrating that p.P209L is not the unique causative mutation of this nephropathy. Thus, TTC21B mutation analysis should be considered for the genetic diagnosis of families with FSGS and tubulointerstitial lesions. Finally, we provide evidence that heterozygous deleterious TTC21B variants may act as genetic modifiers of the severity of glomerular and cystic kidney diseases.	4
Genetic Syndromes Associated with Craniosynostosis. ||  || Craniosynostosis is defined as the premature fusion of one or more of the cranial sutures. It leads not only to secondary distortion of skull shape but to various complications including neurologic, ophthalmic and respiratory dysfunction. Craniosynostosis is very heterogeneous in terms of its causes, presentation, and management. Both environmental factors and genetic factors are associated with development of craniosynostosis. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis accounts for more than 70% of all cases. Syndromic craniosynostosis with a certain genetic cause is more likely to involve multiple sutures or bilateral coronal sutures. FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR1, TWIST1 and EFNB1 genes are major causative genes of genetic syndromes associated with craniosynostosis. Although most of syndromic craniosynostosis show autosomal dominant inheritance, approximately half of patients are de novo cases. Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, and Antley-Bixler syndrome are related to mutations in FGFR family (especially in FGFR2), and mutations in FGFRs can be overlapped between different syndromes. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Muenke syndrome, and craniofrontonasal syndrome are representative disorders showing isolated coronal suture involvement. Compared to the other types of craniosynostosis, single gene mutations can be more frequently detected, in one-third of coronal synostosis patients. Molecular diagnosis can be helpful to provide adequate genetic counseling and guidance for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.	4
Harnessing Fluorine-Sulfur Contacts and Multipolar Interactions for the Design of p53 Mutant Y220C Rescue Drugs. || Biophysics Crystallography, X-Ray Drug Design Fluorine Models, Molecular Molecular Structure Mutation Quantum Theory Sulfur Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Many oncogenic mutants of the tumor suppressor p53 are conformationally unstable, including the frequently occurring Y220C mutant. We have previously developed several small-molecule stabilizers of this mutant. One of these molecules, PhiKan083, 1-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-N-methylmethanamine, binds to a mutation-induced surface crevice with a KD = 150 μM, thereby increasing the melting temperature of the protein and slowing its rate of aggregation. Incorporation of fluorine atoms into small molecule ligands can substantially improve binding affinity to their protein targets. We have, therefore, harnessed fluorine-protein interactions to improve the affinity of this ligand. Step-wise introduction of fluorines at the carbazole ethyl anchor, which is deeply buried within the binding site in the Y220C-PhiKan083 complex, led to a 5-fold increase in affinity for a 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl anchor (ligand efficiency of 0.3 kcal mol(-1) atom(-1)). High-resolution crystal structures of the Y220C-ligand complexes combined with quantum chemical calculations revealed favorable interactions of the fluorines with protein backbone carbonyl groups (Leu145 and Trp146) and the sulfur of Cys220 at the mutation site. Affinity gains were, however, only achieved upon trifluorination, despite favorable interactions of the mono- and difluorinated anchors with the binding pocket, indicating a trade-off between energetically favorable protein-fluorine interactions and increased desolvation penalties. Taken together, the optimized carbazole scaffold provides a promising starting point for the development of high-affinity ligands to reactivate the tumor suppressor function of the p53 mutant Y220C in cancer cells.	0
Prediction of cochlear implant performance by genetic mutation: the spiral ganglion hypothesis. || Acoustic Stimulation Adult Aged Analysis of Variance Audiometry, Pure-Tone Auditory Threshold Carrier Proteins Chi-Square Distribution Cochlear Implantation Cochlear Implants Correction of Hearing Impairment DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Regulation Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Patient Selection Persons With Hearing Impairments Phenotype Serine Endopeptidases Severity of Illness Index Spiral Ganglion || Up to 7% of patients with severe-to-profound deafness do not benefit from cochlear implantation. Given the high surgical implantation and clinical management cost of cochlear implantation (>$1 million lifetime cost), prospective identification of the worst performers would reduce unnecessary procedures and healthcare costs. Because cochlear implants bypass the membranous labyrinth but rely on the spiral ganglion for functionality, we hypothesize that cochlear implant (CI) performance is dictated in part by the anatomic location of the cochlear pathology that underlies the hearing loss. As a corollary, we hypothesize that because genetic testing can identify sites of cochlear pathology, it may be useful in predicting CI performance. 29 adult CI recipients with idiopathic adult-onset severe-to-profound hearing loss were studied. DNA samples were subjected to solution-based sequence capture and massively parallel sequencing using the OtoSCOPE(®) platform. The cohort was divided into three CI performance groups (good, intermediate, poor) and genetic causes of deafness were correlated with audiometric data to determine whether there was a gene-specific impact on CI performance. The genetic cause of deafness was determined in 3/29 (10%) individuals. The two poor performers segregated mutations in TMPRSS3, a gene expressed in the spiral ganglion, while the good performer segregated mutations in LOXHD1, a gene expressed in the membranous labyrinth. Comprehensive literature review identified other good performers with mutations in membranous labyrinth-expressed genes; poor performance was associated with spiral ganglion-expressed genes. Our data support the underlying hypothesis that mutations in genes preferentially expressed in the spiral ganglion portend poor CI performance while mutations in genes expressed in the membranous labyrinth portend good CI performance. Although the low mutation rate in known deafness genes in this cohort likely relates to the ascertainment characteristics (postlingual hearing loss in adult CI recipients), these data suggest that genetic testing should be implemented as part of the CI evaluation to test this association prospectively.	4
Update of Diagnostic Evaluation of Craniosynostosis with a Focus on Pediatric Systematic Evaluation and Genetic Studies. ||  || Most craniosynostoses are sporadic, but may have an underlying genetic basis. Secondary and syndromic craniosynostosis accompanies various systemic diseases or associated anomalies. Early detection of an associated disease may facilitate the interdisciplinary management of patients and improve outcomes. For that reason, systematic evaluation of craniosynostosis is mandatory. The authors reviewed systematic evaluation of craniosynostosis with an emphasis on genetic analysis.	4
A New Mutation Causing Severe Infantile-Onset Pompe Disease Responsive to Enzyme Replacement Therapy. ||  || Pompe disease (PD), also known as "glycogen storage disease type II (OMIM # 232300)" is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive glycogen accumulation in cellular lysosomes. It ultimately leads to cellular damage. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is the most severe type of this disease and is characterized by severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and generalized hypotonia. Mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene, located at locus 17q25.3, are responsible for the disease leading to reduced activity of the acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme. To date, approximately 400 pathogenic mutations have been reported in theGAA gene. The aim of this study is to report a novel nonsense mutation in exon 4 ofthe GAA gene in an Iranian child suffering from IOPD. The patient was a female neonate with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a positive family history of IOPD. After definite diagnosis, enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) was started for the patient, who was 2 months old. Now at the age of 20 months, she has had good growth and development and her echocardiographic parameters are within the normal range. This report shows that IOPD patients with this mutation can be treated with ERT successfully.	1
Impact of specific KRAS mutation in exon 2 on clinical outcome of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-treated colorectal adenocarcinoma patients. || Adenocarcinoma Adult Aged Chemotherapy, Adjuvant Colorectal Neoplasms Exons Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Radiotherapy, Adjuvant Treatment Outcome ras Proteins || Knowledge obtained via high-throughput technologies, used for tumor genome sequencing or identifying gene expression and methylation signatures, is clinically applicable thanks to molecular characterization in the context of tumor development and progression. This study was conducted to assess the impact of specific KRAS mutation in codons 12 and 13 on clinical outcome of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in colorectal cancer patients. A total of 239 samples of colorectal adenocarcinoma underwent histological evaluation and DNA isolation. Patients with a mutation in KRAS codon 13 experienced worse outcome than those with a mutation in KRAS codon 12. Moreover, the cases of mutations in KRAS codons 12 or 13 were associated with a significantly higher mortality than the cases of wild-type KRAS, and some patients with KRAS mutated in codon 12 had an exceptionally long overall survival. Finally, primary preoperative radiation therapy followed by surgery significantly increased overall survival more efficiently than surgery followed by chemotherapy. This should be investigated in further studies. The fact that all patients treated with radiotherapy + surgery were alive, again focused our attention on the effect of preoperative radiation therapy on the prognosis for colorectal cancer patients. However, the number of patients in this subgroup is too small to allow any specific explanation for this observation. We should, rather, point out a problem for further investigation.	4
Subcellular targeting and dynamic regulation of PTEN: implications for neuronal cells and neurological disorders. ||  || PTEN is a lipid and protein phosphatase that regulates a diverse range of cellular mechanisms. PTEN is mainly present in the cytosol and transiently associates with the plasma membrane to dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3, thereby antagonizing the PI3-Kinase signaling pathway. Recently, PTEN has been shown to associate also with organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the mitochondria, or the nucleus, and to be secreted outside of the cell. In addition, PTEN dynamically localizes to specialized sub-cellular compartments such as the neuronal growth cone or dendritic spines. The diverse localizations of PTEN imply a tight temporal and spatial regulation, orchestrated by mechanisms such as posttranslational modifications, formation of distinct protein-protein interactions, or the activation/recruitment of PTEN downstream of external cues. The regulation of PTEN function is thus not only important at the enzymatic activity level, but is also associated to its spatial distribution. In this review we will summarize (i) recent findings that highlight mechanisms controlling PTEN movement and sub-cellular localization, and (ii) current understanding of how PTEN localization is achieved by mechanisms controlling posttranslational modification, by association with binding partners and by PTEN structural or activity requirements. Finally, we will discuss the possible roles of compartmentalized PTEN in developing and mature neurons in health and disease.	0
Targeted gene capture and massively parallel sequencing identify TMC1 as the causative gene in a six-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant hearing loss. || Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Audiometry Base Sequence Case-Control Studies Child Computational Biology DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Genes, Dominant Genetic Loci Genetic Markers Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Membrane Proteins Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Pedigree || Hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss is extremely heterogeneous. Mutations in the transmembrane channel-like gene1 (TMC1) are known to cause autosomal dominant and recessive forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss linked to the loci of DFNA36 and DFNB7/11, respectively. We characterized a six-generation Chinese family (5315) with progressive, postlingual autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL). By combining targeted capture of 82 known deafness genes, next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified TMC1 c.1714G>A (p. D572N) as the disease-causing mutation. This mutation co-segregated with hearing loss in other family members and was not detected in 308 normal controls. In order to determine the prevalence of TMC1 c.1714G>A in Chinese ADNSHL families, we used DNA samples from 67 ADNSHL families with sloping audiogram and identified two families carry this mutation. To determine whether it arose from a common ancestor, we analyzed nine STR markers. Our results indicated that TMC1 c.1714G>A (p.D572N) account for about 4.4% (3/68) of ADNSHL in the Chinese population.	4
[Study on mutations of exon 12 of the PAH gene in 127 phenylketonuria patients]. ||  || To obtain the mutation spectrum of exon 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase(PAH) gene. The samples from 127 patients with phenylketonuria(PKU) were studied by polymerase chain reaction(PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism(SSCP) PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) and direct DNA sequencing. Four heterozygous mutations including R413P S411X R408W R408Q in 10 of 127 patients were identified by DNA sequencing. The frequencies of R413P S411X R408W R408Q mutation were 2.76%, 0.39%, 0.39% and 0.39%, respectively. The S411X mutation in Chinese was first reported. Only 2 cases with R413P mutation were detected by SSCP. DGGE analysis showed that 10 cases displayed 3 kinds of abnormal electrophoretic bands. There were no obvious differences in the frequency of R413P mutation between northern and southern Chinese with PKU, and between classical PKU and hyperphenylalaninemia. DGGE is more sensitive than SSCP in screening the mutations of exon 12 of the PAH gene. DGGE combined with DNA sequencing can be used to define all the mutations of exon 12 of the PAH gene. These results indicate the similarity in the frequency of R413P mutation between northern and southern patients.	1 3
Rescue of melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) nonsense mutations by aminoglycoside-mediated read-through. || Aminoglycosides Blood-Brain Barrier Codon, Nonsense Codon, Terminator Energy Metabolism Female Humans Male Obesity Oxadiazoles Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Signal Transduction || Aminoglycoside-mediated read-through of stop codons was recently demonstrated for a variety of diseases in vitro and in vivo. About 30 percent of human genetic diseases are the consequence of nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations in obesity-associated genes like the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R), expressed in the hypothalamus, show the impact of premature stop codons on energy homeostasis. Therefore, the MC4R could be a potential pharmaceutical target for obesity treatment and targeting MC4R stop mutations could serve as proof of principle for nonsense mutations in genes expressed in the brain. We investigated four naturally occurring nonsense mutations in the MC4R (W16X, Y35X, E61X, Q307X) located at different positions in the receptor for aminoglycoside-mediated functional rescue in vitro. We determined localization and amount of full-length protein before and after aminoglycoside treatment by fluorescence microscopy, cell surface and total enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Signal transduction properties were analyzed by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assays after transient transfection of MC4R wild type and mutant receptors into COS-7 cells. Functional rescue of stop mutations in the MC4R is dependent on: (i) triplet sequence of the stop codon, (ii) surrounding sequence, (iii) location within the receptor, (iv) applied aminoglycoside and ligand. Functional rescue was possible for W16X, Y35X (N-terminus), less successful for Q307X (C-terminus) and barely feasible for E61X (first transmembrane domain). Restoration of full-length proteins by PTC124 could not be confirmed. Future pharmaceutical applications must consider the potency of aminoglycosides to restore receptor function as well as the ability to pass the blood-brain barrier.	0
Myeloid Dysregulation in a Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Model of PTPN11-Associated Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia. || Cells, Cultured HEK293 Cells Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile MicroRNAs Mutation Myeloid Cells Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3 Up-Regulation || Somatic PTPN11 mutations cause juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Germline PTPN11 defects cause Noonan syndrome (NS), and specific inherited mutations cause NS/JMML. Here, we report that hematopoietic cells differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) harboring NS/JMML-causing PTPN11 mutations recapitulated JMML features. hiPSC-derived NS/JMML myeloid cells exhibited increased signaling through STAT5 and upregulation of miR-223 and miR-15a. Similarly, miR-223 and miR-15a were upregulated in 11/19 JMML bone marrow mononuclear cells harboring PTPN11 mutations, but not those without PTPN11 defects. Reducing miR-223's function in NS/JMML hiPSCs normalized myelogenesis. MicroRNA target gene expression levels were reduced in hiPSC-derived myeloid cells as well as in JMML cells with PTPN11 mutations. Thus, studying an inherited human cancer syndrome with hiPSCs illuminated early oncogenesis prior to the accumulation of secondary genomic alterations, enabling us to discover microRNA dysregulation, establishing a genotype-phenotype association for JMML and providing therapeutic targets.	0
Investigating DNA Binding and Conformational Variation in Temperature Sensitive p53 Cancer Mutants Using QM-MM Simulations. || Amino Acids DNA Models, Molecular Mutant Proteins Mutation Principal Component Analysis Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Stability Quantum Theory Solvents Temperature Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tp53 gene is found to be mutated in 50% of all the cancers. The p53 protein, a product of tp53 gene, is a multi-domain protein. It consists of a core DNA binding domain (DBD) which is responsible for its binding and transcription of downstream target genes. The mutations in p53 protein are responsible for creating cancerous conditions and are found to be occurring at a high frequency in the DBD region of p53. Some of these mutations are also known to be temperature sensitive (ts) in nature. They are known to exhibit partial or strong binding with DNA in the temperature range (298-306 K). Whereas, at 310 K and above they show complete loss in binding. We have analyzed the changes in binding and conformational behavior at 300 K and 310 K for three of the ts-mutants viz., V143A, R249S and R175H. QM-MM simulations have been performed on the wild type and the above mentioned ts-mutants for 30 ns each. The optimal estimate of free energy of binding for a particular number of interface hydrogen bonds was calculated using the maximum likelihood method as described by Chodera et. al (2007). This parameter has been observed to be able to mimic the binding affinity of the p53 ts-mutants at 300 K and 310 K. Thus the correlation between MM-GBSA free energy of binding and hydrogen bonds formed by the interface residues between p53 and DNA has revealed the temperature dependent nature of these mutants. The role of main chain dihedrals was obtained by performing dihedral principal component analysis (PCA). This analysis, suggests that the conformational variations in the main chain dihedrals (ϕ and ψ) of the p53 ts-mutants may have caused reduction in the overall stability of the protein. The solvent exposure of the side chains of the interface residues were found to hamper the binding of the p53 to the DNA. Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) also proved to be a crucial property in distinguishing the conformers obtained at 300 K and 310 K for the three ts-mutants from the wild type at 300 K.	0
[Mutation analysis of GJB2, GJB3 and GJB6 gene in deaf population from special educational school of Chifeng city]. || Adolescent Asian Continental Ancestry Group Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Education, Special Female Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Students Young Adult || To investigate the genetic causes of nonsyndromic deaf patients in special educational school of Chifeng city. Inner Mongolia by genetic screening testing method. This study focused on analyzing mutations of coding sequence of GJB2, GJB3 and GJB6 gene. DNA were extracted out from peripheral blood of 134 nonsyndromic deaf probands of Chifeng special educational school and 100 normal hearing controls in northern China. First, GJB2 gene mutation was analyzed by direct sequencing for its only exon in the open reading frame. Individuals found with heterozygous GJB2 mutation were given further testing for GJB6 del(GJB6-D13S1830) and direct sequencing for its exon. In 91 probands with unknown genetic cause (excluding probands who carried mtDNA A1555G mutation and GJB2 gene bi allele mutation and probands who were diagnosed as enlarged vestibular aqueduct by temporal CT), GJB3 gene mutation was analyzed by direct sequencing for its exon. The sequencing results revealed that forty-one cases carried GJB2 mutation. of which twenty-two were homozygous or compound heterozygous and nineteen were heterozygous. Further testing for GJB6 del(GJB6-D13S1830) and analysis of its coding sequence in GJB2 heterozygous cases showed no positive result. Four subjects in control group carried pathogenetic mutation of GJB2 gene. Six types of novel variants of GJB2 gene were detected. Of the 91 deaf probands with unknown etiology. two probands were found carrying heterozygous pathogenetic mutation of GJB3 gene. one of whom also carried GJB2 235delC heterozygous mutation. One subjects in the control group carried pathogenetic mutation of GJB3 gene. Three types of novel variants of GJB3 gene were found. By screening GJB2.GJB3 and GJB6 gene, we found 32.1% probands carrying GJB2, GJB3, and GJB6 mutations and we are able to determine genetic cause related to these three genes from one family for 16.42 percent of nonsyndromic deaf probands in special educational school of Chifeng city. The discovery of novel variants of GJB2 and GJB3 gene makes the mutational and polymorphic spectrum more plentiful in Chinese population.	4
[The study on 235delC mutation of GJB2 gene in patients with idiopathic sudden hearing loss]. ||  || To analyze the rate of 235delC mutation in GJB2 gene in patients with idiopathic sudden hearing loss, and to explore its possible correlation with pathogenesis of idiopathic sudden hearing loss. Two hundred and thirty-four patients with diagnosis of idiopathic sudden hearing loss in otolaryngology department were recruited as experimental group. Eighty people with normal hearing level were enrolled as control group. Their peripheral blood samples were obtained and genomic DNA was extracted. Using polymerase chain reaction, the coding region of GJB2 gene was amplified, and 235delC mutation is screened for in GJB2 gene by restriction endonuclease. At same time the clinical data of 234 patients was collected to analyze. In 234 cases of idiopathic sudden hearing loss, 5 cases were found to have heterozygous 235delC mutation, none of them harbored homozygous 235delC mutation, the 235delC mutation rate was 2.1% (5/234). No 235delC mutation was found in control group. The rate of 235delC mutation in two group showed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). This research shows that the rate of 235delC mutation in GJB2 is low in patients with idiopathic sudden hearing loss, and suggest that 235delC mutation possible has no correlation with idiopathic sudden hearing loss.	4
[Study on the mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in patients with phenylketonuria in Shanxi province]. ||  || To study the mutations in exons 3, 6, 7, 11 and 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) in Shanxi population. The mutations in exons 3, 6, 7, 11 and 12 and flanking sequences of PAH gene were detected by PCR-DNA sequencing, in 59 patients with phynelketonuria(PKU) and 100 healthy children from Shanxi province. By sequence analysis, three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Q232Q (CAA>CAG), V245V (GTG>GTA) and L385L (CTG>CTC) were detected in both the patients and healthy children, with the frequencies of nt 696, 735 and 1155 of the PAH cDNA up to 96.2%, 76.1% and 7.6% in patients respectively, and 97.0%, 77.3% and 8.3% respectively in the healthy controls. In addition, 72 different mutations accounting for 61.0% of mutant alleles were identified in the patients only. In exon 3, R111X, H64>TfsX9 and S70 del were found accounting for 5.1%, 0.8% and 0.8%; EX6-96A>G in exon 6 was found accounting for 10.2%. In exon 7, R243Q was the highest incidence accounting for 12.7%, followed by Ivs7+2 T>A(5.1%) and T278I(2.5%); the lowest incidences were G247V, R252Q, L255S, R261Q and E280K accounting for 0.8 %, respectively. In exon 11, Y356X (5.9%) and V399V (5.1%) were found; in exon 12, R413P and A434D were found accounting for 5.9% and 2.5%. In total, 9 missense mutations, 3 splice site mutations, 2 nonsense mutations and 2 deletions were included in 16 kinds of different mutations. The mutation characteristics and distribution in exons 3, 6, 7, 11 and 12 of the PAH gene have been identified, and it suggested that the EX6-96A>G and R243Q were the hot spots of PAH gene mutations in Shanxi PKU population.	1 3
Expression and functions of galectin-7 in ovarian cancer. || Blotting, Western Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial Cell Line, Tumor Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous Female Fluorescent Antibody Technique Galectins Humans Immunohistochemistry Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial Ovarian Neoplasms Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tissue Array Analysis Transfection || There is a critical need to develop effective new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. In the present work, we investigated the expression of galectin-7 (gal-7) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells and studied its functional relevance. Immunohistochemical analysis of gal-7 expression in tissue microarrays showed that while gal-7 was not detected in normal ovarian tissues, positive cytoplasmic staining of gal-7 was detected in epithelial cells in all EOC histological subtypes but was more frequent in high grade tumors and metastatic samples. Gal-7 expression correlated with a significant difference in the overall survival of patients with ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma. Furthermore, using human EOC cell lines, we found that gal-7 expression was induced by mutant p53. Mechanistically, Matrigel invasion assays and live cell imaging showed that gal-7 increased the invasive behavior of ovarian cancer cells by inducing MMP-9 and increasing cell motility. EOC cells can also secrete gal-7. Recombinant human gal-7 kills Jurkat T cells and human peripheral T cells, suggesting that gal-7 also has immunosuppressive properties. Taken together, our study validates the clinical significance of gal-7 overexpression in ovarian cancer and provides a rationale for targeting gal-7 to improve the outcome of patients with this disease.	0
Isolation and Mechanical Measurements of Myofibrils from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes. || Biomechanical Phenomena Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathies Cell Differentiation Cell Line Excitation Contraction Coupling Gene Expression Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Kinetics Mutation Myocytes, Cardiac Myofibrils Myosin Heavy Chains Nanostructures Primary Cell Culture || Tension production and contractile properties are poorly characterized aspects of excitation-contraction coupling of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Previous approaches have been limited due to the small size and structural immaturity of early-stage hiPSC-CMs. We developed a substrate nanopatterning approach to produce hiPSC-CMs in culture with adult-like dimensions, T-tubule-like structures, and aligned myofibrils. We then isolated myofibrils from hiPSC-CMs and measured the tension and kinetics of activation and relaxation using a custom-built apparatus with fast solution switching. The contractile properties and ultrastructure of myofibrils more closely resembled human fetal myofibrils of similar gestational age than adult preparations. We also demonstrated the ability to study the development of contractile dysfunction of myofibrils from a patient-derived hiPSC-CM cell line carrying the familial cardiomyopathy MYH7 mutation (E848G). These methods can bring new insights to understanding cardiomyocyte maturation and developmental mechanical dysfunction of hiPSC-CMs with cardiomyopathic mutations.	4
Identification of sarcomeric variants in probands with a clinical diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ||  || Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Currently 60% of patients meeting Task Force Criteria (TFC) have an identifiable mutation in one of the desmosomal genes. As much overlap is described between other cardiomyopathies and ARVC, we examined the prevalence of rare, possibly pathogenic sarcomere variants in the ARVC population. One hundred and thirty-seven (137) individuals meeting 2010 TFC for a diagnosis of ARVC, negative for pathogenic desmosomal variants, TMEM43, SCN5A, and PLN were screened for variants in the sarcomere genes (ACTC1, MYBPC3, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, TNNC1, TNNI3, TNNT2, and TPM1) through either clinical or research genetic testing. Six probands (6/137, 4%) were found to carry rare variants in the sarcomere genes. These variants have low prevalence in controls, are predicted damaging by Polyphen-2, and some of the variants are known pathogenic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations. Sarcomere variant carriers had a phenotype that did not differ significantly from desmosomal mutation carriers. As most of these probands were the only affected individuals in their families, however, segregation data are noninformative. These data show variants in the sarcomere can be identified in individuals with an ARVC phenotype. Although rare and predicted damaging, proven functional and segregational evidence that these variants can cause ARVC is lacking. Therefore, caution is warranted in interpreting these variants when identified on large next-generation sequencing panels for cardiomyopathies.	4
Genetics of Bladder Malignant Tumors in Childhood. ||  || Bladder masses are represented by either benign or malignant entities. Malignant bladder tumors are frequent causes of disease and death in western countries. However, in children they are less common. Additionally, different features are found in childhood, in which non epithelial tumors are more common than epithelial ones. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common pediatric bladder tumor, but many other types of lesions may be found, such as malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and neuroblastoma. Other rarer tumors described in literature include urothelial carcinoma and other epithelial neoplasms. Rhabdomyosarcoma is associated to a variety of genetic syndromes and many genes are involved in tumor development. PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR (P-F) fusion state has important implications in the pathogenesis and biology of RMS, and different genes alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of P-F negative and embryonal RMS, which are the subsets of tumors most frequently affecting the bladder. These genes include p53, MEF2, MYOG, Ptch1, Gli1, Gli3, Myf5, MyoD1, NF1, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, FGFR4, PIK3CA, CTNNB1, FBXW7, IGF1R, PDGFRA, ERBB2/4, MET, BCOR. Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) usually shows SMARCB1/INI1 alterations. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations are the most frequently associated alterations in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). Few genes alterations in urothelial neoplasms have been reported in the paediatric population, which are mainly related to deletion of p16/lnk4, overexpression of CK20 and overexpression of p53. Here, we reviewed available literature to identify genes associated to bladder malignancies in children and discussed their possible relationships with these tumors.	4
Pleiotropic Effects of Variants in Dementia Genes in Parkinson Disease. || APP GRN PSEN1 PSEN2 Parkinson disease cognitive impairment dementia rare variants || <b>Background:</b> The prevalence of dementia in Parkinson disease (PD) increases dramatically with advancing age, approaching 80% in patients who survive 20 years with the disease. Increasing evidence suggests clinical, pathological and genetic overlap between Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and frontotemporal dementia with PD. However, the contribution of the dementia-causing genes to PD risk, cognitive impairment and dementia in PD is not fully established. <b>Objective:</b> To assess the contribution of coding variants in Mendelian dementia-causing genes on the risk of developing PD and the effect on cognitive performance of PD patients. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed the coding regions of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (<i>APP</i>), Presenilin 1 and 2 (<i>PSEN1, PSEN2</i>), and Granulin (<i>GRN</i>) genes from 1,374 PD cases and 973 controls using pooled-DNA targeted sequence, human exome-chip and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data by single variant and gene base (SKAT-O and burden tests) analyses. Global cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The effect of coding variants in dementia-causing genes on cognitive performance was tested by multiple regression analysis adjusting for gender, disease duration, age at dementia assessment, study site and <i>APOE</i> carrier status. <b>Results:</b> Known AD pathogenic mutations in the <i>PSEN1</i> (p.A79V) and <i>PSEN2</i> (p.V148I) genes were found in 0.3% of all PD patients. There was a significant burden of rare, likely damaging variants in the <i>GRN</i> and <i>PSEN1</i> genes in PD patients when compared with frequencies in the European population from the ExAC database. Multiple regression analysis revealed that PD patients carrying rare variants in the <i>APP, PSEN1, PSEN2</i>, and <i>GRN</i> genes exhibit lower cognitive tests scores than non-carrier PD patients (<i>p</i> = 2.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), independent of age at PD diagnosis, age at evaluation, <i>APOE</i> status or recruitment site. <b>Conclusions:</b> Pathogenic mutations in the Alzheimer disease-causing genes (<i>PSEN1</i> and <i>PSEN2)</i> are found in sporadic PD patients. PD patients with cognitive decline carry rare variants in dementia-causing genes. Variants in genes causing Mendelian neurodegenerative diseases exhibit pleiotropic effects.	4
Differential sensitization of different prostate cancer cells to apoptosis. ||  || Although protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in sensitizing prostate cancer cells to apoptosis, and suppression of PKC is able to trigger an apoptotic crisis in cells harboring oncogenic ras, little is known about whether dyregulation of Ras effectors in prostate cancer cells, together with loss of PKC, is synthetically lethal. The current study aims at investigating whether prostate cancer cells with aberrant Ras effector signaling are sensitive to treatment with HMG (a PKC inhibitor) for the induction of apoptosis. We show that prostate cancer DU145 cells expressing a high level of JNK1 become susceptible to apoptosis after treatment with HMG, in which caspase 8 is activated and cytochrome c is released to the cytosol. In contrast, the addition of HMG sensitizes LNCaP or PC3 prostate cancer cells harboring an active Akt to apoptosis, in which ROS is upregulated to induce the UPR and GADD153 expression. The concurrent activation of JNK1 and Akt has an additive effect on apoptosis following PKC suppression. Thus, the data identify Akt and JNK1 as potential targets in prostate cancer cells for PKC inhibition-induced apoptosis.	0
PP242 Counteracts Glioblastoma Cell Proliferation, Migration, Invasiveness and Stemness Properties by Inhibiting mTORC2/AKT. ||  || Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor and is associated with poor prognosis due to its thorny localization, lack of efficacious therapies and complex biology. Among the numerous pathways driving GBM biology studied so far, PTEN/phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays a pivotal role, as it controls cell survival, proliferation and metabolism and is involved in stem cell maintenance. In front of recent and numerous evidences highlighting mTOR upregulation in GBM, all the strategies developed to inhibit this pathway have been substantially unsuccessful. Our study focused on mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) to understand its involvement in GBM cell growth, proliferation, migration and invasiveness. We utilized an in vitro model, characterized by various genetic alterations (i.e., GL15, U257, U87MG and U118MG cell lines) in order to achieve the clonal heterogeneity observedin vivo. Additionally, being the U87MG cell line endowed with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), we also investigated the role of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in this specific cell population, which is responsible for GBM relapse. We provide further insights that explain the reasons for the failure of numerous clinical trials conducted to date targeting PI3K or mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) with rapamycin and its analogs. Additionally, we show that mTORC2 might represent a potential clinically valuable target for GBM treatment, as proliferation, migration and GSC maintenance appear to be mTORC2-dependent. In this context, we demonstrate that the novel ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor PP242 effectively targets both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation and counteracts cell proliferation via the induction of high autophagy levels, besides reducing cell migration, invasiveness and stemness properties.	0
Newborn genetic screening for hearing impairment: a population-based longitudinal study. || Audiometry Child Child, Preschool Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Neonatal Screening Sulfate Transporters || The feasibility of genetic screening for deafness-causing mutations in newborns has been reported in several studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term results in those who screened positive for deafness mutations; these results are crucial to determine the cost-effectiveness to justify population-wide genetic screening. We performed simultaneous hearing screening and genetic screening targeting four common deafness mutations (p.V37I and c.235delC of GJB2, c.919-2A>G of SLC26A4, and the mitochondrial m.1555A>G) in 5173 newborns at a tertiary hospital between 2009 and 2015. Serial audiometric results up to 6 years old were then analyzed in children with conclusive genotypes. Newborn genetic screening identified 82 (1.6%) babies with conclusive genotypes, comprising 62 (1.2%) with GJB2 p.V37I/p.V37I, 16 (0.3%) with GJB2 p.V37I/c.235delC, and 4 (0.1%) with m.1555A>G. Of these, 46 (56.1%) passed hearing screening at birth. Long-term follow-up demonstrated progressive hearing loss in children with the GJB2 p.V37I/p.V37I and p.V37I/c.235delC genotypes; this hearing loss deteriorated by approximately 1 decibel hearing level (dBHL) per year. We delineated the longitudinal auditory features of the highly prevalent GJB2 p.V37I mutation on a general population basis and confirmed the utility of newborn genetic screening in identifying infants with late-onset or progressive hearing impairment undetectable by newborn hearing screening.Genet Med 19 1, 6-12.	1
Mutation analysis of BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2 in 15 ovarian cancer cell lines: implications for therapy. || Base Sequence Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor DNA Primers Female Humans MAP Kinase Kinase 1 MAP Kinase Kinase 2 Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Transfection || Among gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer is the second most common and has the highest death rate. Cancer is a genetic disorder and arises due to the accumulation of somatic mutations in critical genes. An understanding of the genetic basis of ovarian cancer has implications both for early detection and for therapeutic intervention in this population of patients. Fifteen ovarian cancer cell lines, commonly used for in vitro experiments, were screened for mutations using bidirectional direct sequencing in all coding regions of BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2. BRAF mutations were identified in four of the fifteen ovarian cancer cell lines studied. Together, these four cell lines contained four different BRAF mutations, two of which were novel. ES-2 had the common B-Raf p.V600E mutation in exon 15 and Hey contained an exon 11 missense mutation, p.G464E. The two novel B-Raf mutants identified were a 5 amino acid heterozygous deletion p.N486-P490del in OV90, and an exon 4 missense substitution p.Q201H in OVCAR 10. One of the cell lines, ES-2, contained a mutation in MEK1, specifically, a novel heterozygous missense substitution, p.D67N which resulted from a nt 199 G-->A transition. None of the cell lines contained coding region mutations in MEK2. Functional characterization of the MEK1 mutant p.D67N by transient transfection with subsequent Western blot analysis demonstrated increased ERK phosphorylation as compared to controls. In this study, we report novel BRAF mutations in exon 4 and exon 12 and also report the first mutation in MEK1 associated with human cancer. Functional data indicate the MEK1 mutation may confer alteration of activation through the MAPK pathway. The significance of these findings is that BRAF and MEK1/2 mutations may be more common than anticipated in ovarian cancer which could have important implications for treatment of patients with this disease and suggests potential new therapeutic avenues.	0
Audiometric, vestibular, and genetic aspects of a DFNA9 family with a G88E COCH mutation. ||  || To perform genetic analysis and to analyze cochleovestibular impairment features in a newly identified Dutch family with nonsyndromic autosomal dominant hearing impairment (DFNA9). Genetic analysis was performed using microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Audiometric data were collected and analyzed longitudinally. Results were compared with those obtained in previously identified P51S COCH mutation carriers (n = 74). Special attention was also given to a comparison of age-related features such as progressive hearing loss and vestibular impairment. Tertiary referral center. G88E COCH mutation carriers from a Dutch family. The study of clinical features of a DFNA9 family carrying a G88E COCH mutation and to compare this to the symptoms of those carrying a P51S/COCH mutation. Pure-tone thresholds, phoneme recognition scores, and vestibular responses of the G88E mutation carriers were essentially similar to those previously established in the P51S mutation carriers. Hearing started to deteriorate in G88E mutation carriers from age 46 to 49 years and onward, whereas deterioration of vestibular function started from approximately age 46 years. In the P51S mutation carriers, vestibular impairment started earlier, at approximately age 34 years. However, the difference in age of onset with the G88E mutation carriers was not significant. Remarkably, the proportion of patients who developed complete vestibular areflexia within the age range of 40 to 56 years was significantly lower for the G88E mutation carriers than for the P51S mutation carriers. Apart from a significantly lower frequency of vestibular areflexia between the ages of 40 and 56 years, there are no phenotypic differences between carriers of the G88E and P51S mutations in the COCH gene.	4
A mutant p53/let-7i-axis-regulated gene network drives cell migration, invasion and metastasis. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement DNA Mutational Analysis Down-Regulation Female Gene Regulatory Networks Humans Mice Mice, Nude MicroRNAs Mutation, Missense Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Transplantation Neoplasms RNA, Small Interfering Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Most p53 mutations in human cancers are missense mutations resulting in a full-length mutant p53 protein. Besides losing tumor suppressor activity, some hotspot p53 mutants gain oncogenic functions. This effect is mediated in part, through gene expression changes due to inhibition of p63 and p73 by mutant p53 at their target gene promoters. Here, we report that the tumor suppressor microRNA let-7i is downregulated by mutant p53 in multiple cell lines expressing endogenous mutant p53. In breast cancer patients, significantly decreased let-7i levels were associated with missense mutations in p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter luciferase assays established let-7i as a transcriptional target of mutant p53 through p63. Introduction of let-7i to mutant p53 cells significantly inhibited migration, invasion and metastasis by repressing a network of oncogenes including E2F5, LIN28B, MYC and NRAS. Our findings demonstrate that repression of let-7i expression by mutant p53 has a key role in enhancing migration, invasion and metastasis.	0
Genetic heterogeneity in five Italian regions: analysis of PAH mutations and minihaplotypes. ||  || Molecular analysis of 289 chromosomes has been performed in a cohort of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients whose ancestors lived in five Italian regions, Calabria, Campania, Piemonte, Puglia/Basilicata and Sicilia. Phenylalaninehydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations and minihaplotypes (combinations of PAH gene STR and VNTR systems) have been determined for 78.5 and 64%, respectively, of the chromosomes studied. 21 different minihaplotypes and 24 PKU mutations were found. Heterogeneity tests carried out for the frequencies of mutations and minihaplotypes show that the distribution of eight mutations and four minihaplotypes is statistically heterogeneous in the five Italian regions. Although the evolutionary rate of microsatellites or the age of these mutations is difficult to estimate with accuracy, our findings taken together show a genetic stratification of the Italian population. These results rule out allelic homogeneity of PKU at the molecular level between regions of Italy, yet minihaplotype data may be of practical use for a multistep approach to PAH gene genotyping.	3
FKBP10 depletion enhances glucocerebrosidase proteostasis in Gaucher disease fibroblasts. || Amino Acid Sequence Cell Line Endoplasmic Reticulum Fibroblasts Gaucher Disease Glucosylceramidase Homeostasis Humans Lectins Molecular Sequence Data Muramidase Neoplasm Proteins Protein Folding Protein Transport Proteolysis Proteomics Reproducibility of Results Tacrolimus Binding Proteins alpha-Mannosidase || Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are often caused by mutations compromising lysosomal enzyme folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to degradation and loss of function. Mass spectrometry analysis of Gaucher fibroblasts treated with mechanistically distinct molecules that increase LSD enzyme folding, trafficking, and function resulted in the identification of nine commonly downregulated and two jointly upregulated proteins, which we hypothesized would be critical proteostasis network components for ameliorating loss-of-function diseases. LIMP-2 and FK506 binding protein 10 (FKBP10) were validated as such herein. Increased FKBP10 levels accelerated mutant glucocerebrosidase degradation over folding and trafficking, whereas decreased ER FKBP10 concentration led to more LSD enzyme partitioning into the calnexin profolding pathway, enhancing folding and activity to levels thought to ameliorate LSDs. Thus, targeting FKBP10 appears to be a heretofore unrecognized therapeutic strategy to ameliorate LSDs.	0
p53 mutants without a functional tetramerisation domain are not oncogenic. || ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1 Amino Acid Substitution Genes, Dominant Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Neoplasms Oligodeoxyribonucleotides Osteosarcoma Phenotype Precipitin Tests Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Protein Biosynthesis Recombinant Proteins Response Elements Transfection Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is altered in about 50 % of cancers. Most of the p53 mutants have lost the wild-type tumour suppressor activity but show oncogenic properties. The majority of the p53 alterations are missense mutations of residues located in its DNA binding domain (DBD). Only a few mutations concern residues in its tetramerisation domain (TD). However, the study of mutant proteins identified in tumors that do not form tetramers has shown that they have lost the wild-type activity like most of the p53 DBD mutants. Here, we show that two of such mutant proteins, Arg342Pro and Leu344Pro are not dominant negative and do not stimulate the expression of a reporter gene under the control of the multi-drug resistance gene-1 (MDR-1). This suggests that to be oncogenic, p53 mutants need to form tetramers. Accordingly, the dominant negative effect and the ability of a tetrameric mutant protein, Asp281Gly, to stimulate the MDR-1 promoter are abolished when its TD is rendered non-functional by the mutation of leucine 344 to a proline residue. These results suggest that mutations in the TD, are less selected in tumors than mutations in the DBD because they do not lead to oncogenic proteins.	0
[Mutation spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in patients with phenylketonuria in Tianjin and surrounding areas of Northern China]. ||  || To investigate the characteristics of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Tianjin and surrounding area, in order to provide basic information for genetic counseling and prenatal gene diagnosis. All of the 13 exons and flanking introns of the PAH gene from 99 patients with PKU were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and DNA sequencing. Mutations were found in all exons or flanking introns of the PAH gene except for exons 9 and 13. A total of 41 different mutations were identified which corresponded to 93.94% (186/198) of the PAH alleles, including 22 missense mutations (53.6%), 7 nonsense mutations (17.1%), 9 splicing junction mutations(22.0%), and 3 deletion mutations (7.3%). Six novel mutations (IVS3nt+1g--> a, A165D, Q301X, G344D, P362L and R413G) were identified and another 6 mutations (S16fsdelCT, R71H, IVS5nt+1g--> a, G239S, R243X and R261X) were reported in Chinese population for the first time according to the databases from http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca. The most common mutations included 243Q (36/198,18.18%), V399V (22/198, 11.1%), R111X (19/198, 9.6%), E6nt-96A--> g (18/198, 9.1%), R413P (15/198, 7.6%) and Y356X (13/198, 6.6%). In addition, 4 silent mutations (except V399V) in exons and 8 variations in introns were found in this study. The IVS1nt+40t--> g and IVS10nt-31g--> a were confirmed as novel variations by international PAH databases and IVS5nt-54g--> a was the first report in China. The frequencies of six common mutations were close to that in Beijing area of China, but it was different in sequence. The extensive mutation spectrum of the PAH gene showed higher heterogeneity in Tianjin and surrounding areas of Northern China comparing with other reports. According to this report, exons 7 and 11 are the hot spots and should be detected first for PAH gene quick diagnosis in this area, then comes exons 3, 6 and 12, and finally exons 5, 10 and others.	3
Rapamycin sensitizes cancer cells to growth inhibition by the PARP inhibitor olaparib. ||  || Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have been developed and tested in a context of combining it with double-stranded (ds) DNA repair defects or inhibitors, as PARP inhibitor impairs single-stranded (ss) DNA break repair, resulting in the activation of the dsDNA break repair machinery. Rapamycin has been widely prescribed for more than a decade and recent studies have revealed that it may inhibit dsDNA break repair. The combination of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and rapamycin synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and even in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with BRCA1 mutations. Rad51, which forms a polymer on ssDNA upon dsDNA breaks, plays an essential role in homologous recombination. Olaparib induced Rad51 focus formation, while rapamycin successfully inhibited it both in vivo andin vitro, suggesting that this combination worked through the blocking of both ssDNA break repair and dsDNA break repair; hence the cells cannot go through the G2/M checkpoint. The protein level of PARP was a predictive marker for both PAR activity and Rad51 focus formation in this combination. Collectively, these data suggest that this combination could have therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer with high PARP expression, or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy.	0
Muencke syndrome with cleft lip and palate. || Adult Cleft Lip Cleft Palate Craniosynostoses DNA Mutational Analysis Diseases in Twins Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Syndrome Twins, Monozygotic Ultrasonography, Prenatal || Muencke syndrome results from mutations in the FGFR3 gene, and although it is well recognized that the clinical presentation is variable, the important key finding includes coronal synostosis. We present a family where a mother with proven FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation gave birth to identical twins both of whom had craniosynostosis but had coexisting bilateral cleft lip and palate. We believe that this is the first description of clefting occurring in conjunction with Muencke syndrome and so further extends the range of phenotypic variation that can occur in this syndrome.	4
Conditioned media from human macrophages of M1 phenotype attenuate the cytotoxic effect of 5‑fluorouracil on the HT‑29 colon cancer cell line. || Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic Caco-2 Cells Cell Cycle Cell Survival Colonic Neoplasms Culture Media, Conditioned Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Fluorouracil HT29 Cells Humans Macrophages Phenotype || Resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy, such as 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU), is an obstacle for successful treatment of cancer. As a follow‑up of a previous study we have investigated the effect of conditioned media (CM) from macrophages of M1 or M2 phenotypes on 5‑FU cytotoxicity on the colon cancer cell lines HT‑29 and CACO‑2. HT‑29 cells, but not CACO‑2 cells, having been treated with a combination of M1 CM and 5‑FU recovered their cell growth to a much larger extent compared to cells having been treated with 5‑FU alone when further cultured for 7 days in fresh media. M1 CM treatment of HT‑29, but not CACO‑2 cells, induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases. 5‑FU treatment induced accumulation of cells in S‑phase in both HT‑29 and CACO‑2 cells. This accumulation of cells in S‑phase was attenuated by combined M1 CM and 5‑FU treatment in HT‑29 cells, but not in CACO‑2 cells. The mRNA expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins and 5‑FU metabolic enzymes were analyzed in an attempt to find possible mechanisms for the M1 CM induced attenuation of 5‑FU cytotoxicity in HT‑29. Thymidylate synthetase (TS) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP) were found to be substantially downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in HT‑29 cells treated with M1 CM, making them unlikely as mediators of reduced 5‑FU cytotoxicity. Among cell cycle regulating proteins, p21 was induced in HT‑29 cells, but not in CACO‑2 cells, in response to M1 CM treatment. However, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of p21 had no effect on the M1 CM induced cell cycle arrest seen in HT‑29 and neither did it change the growth recovery after combined treatment of HT‑29 cells with M1 CM and 5‑FU. In conclusion, treatment of HT‑29 cells with M1 CM reduces the cytotoxic effect of 5‑FU and this is mediated by a M1 CM induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases. So far, we lack an explanation why this action is absent in the CACO‑2 cells. The current findings may be important for optimization of chemotherapy in colon cancer.	0
Combining Oncolytic Virotherapy with p53 Tumor Suppressor Gene Therapy. ||  || Oncolytic virus (OV) therapy utilizes replication-competent viruses to kill cancer cells, leaving non-malignant cells unharmed. With the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved OV, dozens of clinical trials ongoing, and an abundance of translational research in the field, OV therapy is poised to be one of the leading treatments for cancer. A number of recombinant OVs expressing a transgene for p53 (TP53) or another p53 family member (TP63 or TP73) were engineered with the goal of generating more potent OVs that function synergistically with host immunity and/or other therapies to reduce or eliminate tumor burden. Such transgenes have proven effective at improving OV therapies, and basic research has shown mechanisms of p53-mediated enhancement of OV therapy, provided optimized p53 transgenes, explored drug-OV combinational treatments, and challenged canonical roles for p53 in virus-host interactions and tumor suppression. This review summarizes studies combining p53 gene therapy with replication-competent OV therapy, reviews preclinical and clinical studies with replication-deficient gene therapy vectors expressing p53 transgene, examines how wild-type p53 and p53 modifications affect OV replication and anti-tumor effects of OV therapy, and explores future directions for rational design of OV therapy combined with p53 gene therapy.	0
Mutant p53 induces EZH2 expression and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition by disrupting p68-Drosha complex assembly and attenuating miR-26a processing. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Animals Carcinoma Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement DEAD-box RNA Helicases Disease Progression Endometrial Neoplasms Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Female Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mice, Nude MicroRNAs Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional Ribonuclease III Signal Transduction Time Factors Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumor suppressor p53 and the transcriptional repressor Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) have both been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis via their impacts on microRNA expression. Here, we report that mutant p53 (mutp53) promotes EMT in endometrial carcinoma (EC) by disrupting p68-Drosha complex assembly. Overexpression of mutp53 has the opposite effect of wild-type p53 (WTp53), repressing miR-26a expression by reducing pri-miR-26a-1 processing in p53-null EC cells. Re-expression of miR-26a in mutp53 EC cells decreases cell invasion and promotes mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Rescuing miR-26a expression also inhibits EZH2, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail expression and induces E-cadherin expression both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, patients with higher serum miR-26a levels have a better survival rate. These results suggest that p53 gain-of-function mutations accelerate EC tumor progression and metastasis by interfering with Drosha and p68 binding and pri-miR-26a-1 processing, resulting in reduced miR-26a expression and EZH2 overexpression.	0
Nano-LC-MS/MS for Quantification of Lyso-Gb3 and Its Analogues Reveals a Useful Biomarker for Fabry Disease. || Adolescent Adult Aged Biomarkers Child Chromatography, Liquid Fabry Disease Female Glycolipids Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Nanotechnology Sphingolipids Tandem Mass Spectrometry Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || Biomarkers useful for diagnosis and evaluation of treatment for patients with Fabry disease are urgently needed. Recently, plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and lyso-Gb3-related analogues have attracted attention as promising biomarkers of Fabry disease. However, the plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues are extremely low or below the detection limits in some Fabry patients as well as in healthy subjects. In this paper, we introduce the novel application of a nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) system to the measurement of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues in plasma. Nano-LC-MS/MS requires smaller amounts of samples and is more sensitive than conventional techniques. Using this method, we measured the plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues in 40 healthy subjects, 5 functional variants (males with E66Q), and various Fabry patients (9 classic Fabry males/9 mutations; 7 later-onset Fabry males/5 mutations; and 10 Fabry females/9 mutations). The results revealed that the mean lyso-Gb3 and lyso-Gb3(-2) concentrations in all the Fabry patient subgroups were statistically higher, especially in the classic Fabry males, than those in the functional variants and healthy subjects. The plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues in healthy subjects, functional variants, and some Fabry patients with specific mutations (R112H and M296I) that cannot be established by conventional techniques were successfully determined by means of nano-LC-MS/MS. The lyso-Gb3 and lyso-Gb3(-2) concentrations in male patients with these mutations were lower than those in most Fabry patients having other mutations, but higher than those in the functional variants and healthy subjects. This new method is expected to be useful for sensitive determination of the plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues. This study also revealed that not only lyso-Gb3 but also lyso-Gb3(-2) in plasma is a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of Fabry disease.	4
SW480, a p53 double-mutant cell line retains proficiency for some p53 functions. || Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17 Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 DNA Mutational Analysis Gene Expression Regulation Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Karyotyping Promoter Regions, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || During certain types of cellular stress, the p53 tumor suppressor protein binds to DNA and transactivates a variety of genes that regulate critical responses including apoptosis, cell cycle checkpoints, differentiation, and angiogenesis. In addition, functional p53 is known to be required for efficient nucleotide excision repair (NER) of bulky DNA adducts generated through exposure to environmental mutagens such as UV light. Nonetheless, we previously showed that the model p53-mutated human adenocarcinoma strain SW480 is proficient in the removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) via NER. We undertook the present study to begin probing the molecular basis for this unexpected repair phenotype. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that SW480 is stable at the chromosomal level, i.e. manifests a karyotypic profile very similar to that revealed for this line as far back as 14 years ago. After fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using a probe complementary to the p53 gene, we found that 98% of the SW480 interphase nuclei contains three copies of the gene, later revealed to be localized on intact short arms of three chromosomes 17. DNA sequence analysis further showed that all three p53 copies in SW480 carry two point mutations (R273H and P309S), and levels of the corresponding mutated p53 protein are about 20-fold higher than in the closely related p53 wild-type strain LoVo. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we demonstrated that R273H/P309S p53 is able to bind with wild-type affinity to its consensus DNA sequence in vitro. Analysis of p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression and in vivo footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR) showed that, in wild-type LoVo cells, an exposure to cellular stress (e.g. UV or ionizing radiation) is necessary for p53 activation of the p21(Cip1/WAF1) promoter. In contrast, the R273H/P309S-mutated p53 protein in SW480 constitutively activates p21(Cip1/WAF1) in the absence of stress through an unknown mechanism. A similar phenomenon whereby mutated p53 in SW480 is able to induce NER-related proteins might explain the normal DNA repair phenotype previously observed in this strain. For now we conclude that, in general, results obtained using SW480 as a p53-deficient cell line should be interpreted very cautiously.	0
The impact on high-grade serous ovarian cancer of obesity and lipid metabolism-related gene expression patterns: the underestimated driving force affecting prognosis. ||  || To investigate whether specific obesity/metabolism-related gene expression patterns affect the survival of patients with ovarian cancer. Clinical and genomic data of 590 samples from the high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma (HGOSC) study of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 91 samples from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study were downloaded from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) portal. Clustering of mRNA microarray and reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) data was performed with 83 consensus driver genes and 144 obesity and lipid metabolism-related genes. Association between different clusters and survival was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox regression. Mutually exclusive, co-occurrence and network analyses were also carried out. Using RNA and RPPA data, it was possible to identify two subsets of HGOSCs with similar clinical characteristics and cancer driver mutation profiles (e.g. TP53), but with different outcome. These differences depend more on up-regulation of specific obesity and lipid metabolism-related genes than on the number of gene mutations or copy number alterations. It was also found that CD36 and TGF-ß are highly up-regulated at the protein levels in the cluster with the poorer outcome. In contrast, BSCL2 is highly up-regulated in the cluster with better progression-free and overall survival. Different obesity/metabolism-related gene expression patterns constitute a risk factor for prognosis independent of the therapy results in the Cox regression. Prognoses were conditioned by the differential expression of obesity and lipid metabolism-related genes in HGOSCs with similar cancer driver mutation profiles, independent of the initial therapeutic response.	4
Homozygous truncating mutation in NRAP gene identified by whole exome sequencing in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy. || Adult Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Female Genotype Homozygote Humans Male Muscle Proteins Mutation Pedigree Whole Exome Sequencing || The genetic background of dilated cardiomyopathy is highly heterogeneous, with close to 100 known genes and a number of candidates described to date. Nebulin-related-anchoring protein (NRAP) is an actin-binding cytoskeletal protein expressed predominantly in striated and cardiac muscles, and is involved in myofibrillar assembly in the foetal heart and in force transmission in the adult heart. The homozygous NRAP truncating variant (rs201084642), which is predicted to introduce premature stop codon into all NRAP isoforms, was revealed in the dilated cardiomyopathy patient using whole exome sequencing. The same genotype was detected in the asymptomatic proband's brother. The expression of the NRAP protein was undetectable in the patient's heart muscle by the Western blot. Genotyping for rs201084642 in the ethnically matched cohort of 231 dilated cardiomyopathy patients did not reveal any additional subjects with this variant. Our findings suggest that the biallelic loss-of-function mutation in NRAP could constitute a relatively rare, low-penetrance genetic risk factor for dilated cardiomyopathy.	4

Targeting TopBP1 at a convergent point of multiple oncogenic pathways for cancer therapy. || Animals Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Carrier Proteins DNA-Binding Proteins E2F1 Transcription Factor Female Fluoresceins Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Heterografts Humans Mice Neoplasm Transplantation Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The progression of many solid tumours is driven by deregulation of multiple common pathways, particularly Rb, PI(3)K/Akt and p53. Prior studies identified TopBP1 as a key mediator for the oncogenic gain-of-function activities of mutant p53 (mutp53) in cancer. In Akt-hyperactive cancer, TopBP1 forms oligomers and represses E2F1-dependent apoptosis. Here we perform a molecular docking screening and identify a lead compound, calcein, capable of blocking TopBP1 oligomerization and p53 binding, resulting in re-activation of E2F1-dependent apoptosis and blockade of mutp53 gain-of-function. Calcein AM, the cell-permeable derivative of calcein, shows significant antitumour activity in a wide spectrum of cultured cancer cells harbouring high TopBP1 levels. These biochemical findings are recapitulated in breast cancer xenograft models. Thus, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence for targeting TopBP1, a convergent point of multiple pathways, as a cancer therapy.	0
Patterns and Biologic Features of p53 Mutation Types in Korean Breast Cancer Patients. ||  || The p53 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer. We investigated the patterns and biologic features of p53 gene mutation and evaluated their clinical significance in Korean breast cancer patients. Patients who underwent p53 gene sequencing were included. Mutational analysis of exon 5 to exon 9 of the p53 gene was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. A total of 497 patients were eligible for the present study and p53 gene mutations were detected in 71 cases (14.3%). Mutation of p53 was significantly associated with histologic grading (p<0.001), estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status (p<0.001), HER2 status (p<0.001), Ki-67 (p=0.028), and tumor size (p=0.004). The most frequent location of p53 mutations was exon 7 and missense mutation was the most common type of mutation. Compared with patients without mutation, there was a statistically significant difference in relapse-free survival of patients with p53 gene mutation and missense mutation (p=0.020, p=0.006, respectively). Only p53 missense mutation was an independent prognostic factor for relapse-free survival in multivariate analysis, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-4.89, p=0.031). Mutation of the p53 gene was associated with more aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics and p53 missense mutation was an independent negative prognostic factor in Korean breast cancer patients.	4
A pathogenic mosaic TP53 mutation in two germ layers detected by next generation sequencing. || Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Germ-Line Mutation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Infant Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Male Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by germline TP53 mutations and is clinically characterized by a predisposition to a range of cancers, most commonly sarcoma, brain tumours and leukemia. Pathogenic mosaic TP53 mutations have only rarely been described. We describe a 2 years old child presenting with three separate cancers over a 6 month period; two soft tissue mesenchymal tumors and an aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma. As conventional testing of blood DNA by Sanger sequencing for mutations in TP53, ALK, and SDH was negative, whole exome sequencing of the blood DNA of the patient and both parents was performed to screen more widely for cancer predisposing mutations. In the patient's but not the parents' DNA we found a c.743 G>A, p.Arg248Gln (CCDS11118.1) TP53 mutation in 3-20% of sequencing reads, a level that would not generally be detectable by Sanger sequencing. Homozygosity for this mutation was detected in all tumor samples analyzed, and germline mosaicism was demonstrated by analysis of the child's newborn blood spot DNA. The occurrence of separate tumors derived from different germ layers suggests that this de novo mutation occurred early in embryogenesis, prior to gastrulation. The case demonstrates pathogenic mosaicim, detected by next generation deep sequencing, that arose in the early stages of embryogenesis.	4
[Singleton and twin pregnancies of PKU patients - individual variability of phenylalanine tolerance: experience of a single treatment center (Preliminary report)]. ||  PKU  maternal-fetal interactions birthweight discordance phenylalanine tolerance pregnancy characteristics twin pregnancy  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the autosomal recessive deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase resulting in the accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) in blood and in the brain. Phe restriction in a patient's diet is determined depending on the amount of Phe intake which allows for stable blood Phe levels within the therapeutic range of 120-360µmol/L. In clinical practice the empirical determination of Phe tolerance relies on frequent assessment of blood Phe concentrations in relation to Phe intake from food records. Untreated maternal PKU may lead to maternal PKU syndrome in offspring. The objective of the study was to compare Phe tolerance during the course of singleton and multiple pregnancies of PKU patients. Case subjects and methods: The cases reviewed included three sets of classical PKU-affected Polish women on a low-phenylalanine diet during the course of singleton and twin pregnancies and their PKU-unaffected newborns. All the patients were under regular supervision of a metabolic dietitian to stabilize blood Phe levels and determine Phe tolerance. Data on pregnancy weight gain, the gestational age when the diet initiated, the percent of Phe assessments < 120 µmol/L and > 360 µmol/L, as well as offspring birth measurements were analyzed. The total increase in Phe tolerance and its pattern during the course of singleton and twin pregnancies differed remarkably in each patient. Three PKU women (Q383X/R408W, EX3DEL/EX3DEL, R281L/R408W) increased their Phe tolerance in singleton and twin pregnancies by 579%/468%, 674%/261%, and 427%/236%, respectively. During the last 10 weeks of singleton and twin pregnancy Phe tolerance showed an increase by 62%/149%, 33%/64%, and 37%/40%, respectively. The analysis of predictors for Phe tolerance showed that an individual's weight gain and the fetal weight gain as estimated from liveborn birth-weight data had no predictive capacity. Individual Phe tolerance in singleton pregnancies of PKU patients does not predict tolerance in twin pregnancy. Further research on the growing population of multiple pregnancy PKU patients is necessary to provide evidence-based guidelines to optimize the treatment of PKU in females of childbearing age.	1 3
Elevated Lyso-Gb3 Suggests the R118C GLA Mutation Is a Pathological Fabry Variant. || Fabry disease Lyso-Gb3 Pathological variant || Fabry disease (FD), an X-linked lysosomal storage disease, results from an α-galactosidase A deficiency and altered sphingolipid metabolism. An accumulation of globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) likely triggers the pathological cascade leading to disease phenotype. The pathogenic significance of several Fabry mutations including the R118C α-galactosidase (GLA) gene variant has been disputed. We describe three members of the same family with the R118C variant, each having documented clinical signs of FD, low residual enzyme levels, and an elevated lyso-Gb3 in one heterozygote.Determining the clinical significance of each GLA gene variant remains an ongoing challenge, with potential for inadequate treatment if the diagnosis of FD is missed. Elevated lyso-Gb3 has been shown to be the most reliable noninvasive marker of clinically relevant GLA variants. While the R118C variant will likely lead to a milder phenotype, additional genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors can ameliorate or exacerbate the expression and impact on the resultant phenotype and associated complications. Patients affected with this variant warrant closer review and better management of disease risk factors.	3
Detection of point mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and prenatal diagnosis of phenylketonuria. ||  || The known mutant alleles of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAN) gene were analyzed in 25 phenylketonuria (PKU) families from North China by using polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide dot blot hybridization techniques. The results showed that the six mutations analyzed accounted for 62% of all PKU genes. The three most frequent mutations were R243Q, R413P and Y204C. Seven prenatal gene diagnoses were carried out in 6 PKU families and were confirmed after birth or by examination of aborted materials.	3

Despite great strides in our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of the Ras proteins, the expanding roster of their downstream effectors and the complexity of the signalling cascades that they regulate indicate that much remains to be learnt.	0
Using exome data to identify malignant hyperthermia susceptibility mutations. || Aged Calcium Channels Cohort Studies Databases, Genetic Exome Exons Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Malignant Hyperthermia Middle Aged Mutation Mutation, Missense Penetrance Predictive Value of Tests Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel || Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a life-threatening, inherited disorder of muscle calcium metabolism, triggered by anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. An unselected cohort was screened for MHS mutations using exome sequencing. The aim of this study was to pilot a strategy for the RYR1 and CACNA1S genes. Exome sequencing was performed on 870 volunteers not ascertained for MHS. Variants in RYR1 and CACNA1S were annotated using an algorithm that filtered results based on mutation type, frequency, and information in mutation databases. Variants were scored on a six-point pathogenicity scale. Medical histories and pedigrees were reviewed for malignant hyperthermia and related disorders. The authors identified 70 RYR1 and 53 CACNA1S variants among 870 exomes. Sixty-three RYR1 and 41 CACNA1S variants passed the quality and frequency metrics but the authors excluded synonymous variants. In RYR1, the authors identified 65 missense mutations, one nonsense, two that affected splicing, and one non-frameshift indel. In CACNA1S, 48 missense, one frameshift deletion, one splicing, and one non-frameshift indel were identified. RYR1 variants predicted to be pathogenic for MHS were found in three participants without medical or family histories of MHS. Numerous variants, previously described as pathogenic in mutation databases, were reclassified by the authors as being of unknown pathogenicity. Exome sequencing can identify asymptomatic patients at risk for MHS, although the interpretation of exome variants can be challenging. The use of exome sequencing in unselected cohorts is an important tool to understand the prevalence and penetrance of MHS, a critical challenge for the field.	4
Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica: a case of HRAS mosaicism causing rhabdomyosarcoma. ||  || A 17-year-old male presented with a large sebaceous naevus (SN) comprising part of his right face and scalp and a speckled lentiginous naevus (SLN) on his left trunk, hip, neck and scalp with a checkerboard pattern. His right oral hemimucosa showed extensive papillomatous lesions, which were contiguous with the upper-lip SN lesions. He also showed extracutaneous manifestations including cardiac, musculoskeletal and ocular alterations. Internally, he had developed two primary rhabdomyosarcomas. DNA samples of the SN, SLN, oral papillomatous hyperplasia and both rhabdomyosarcomas were analysed by Sanger sequencing. An HRAS c.37G>C mutation was detected in all of them. Skin and blood DNA were wild-type. Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica (PPK) is characterized by the association of an SN with a papular naevus spilus and extracutaneous manifestations. Until recently, the aetiopathogenetic hypothesis of didymosis was accepted. However, in 2013 Groesser et al. proved the existence of an activating HRAS mutation as the cause of this syndrome. A higher incidence of cancer has been observed in germline RASopathies. Furthermore, up to 30% of human cancers show dysregulation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways. In our patient, an HRAS mosaic mutation explains not only the cutaneous but also the extracutaneous manifestations. To our knowledge this is the first described case of PPK in which the existence of an HRAS mosaic mutation is the confirmed cause of rhabdomyosarcoma. Furthermore, the HRAS c.37G>C mutation has never been related to any type of rhabdomyosarcoma. Mosaicisms could be underdiagnosed causes of childhood tumours. As dermatologists we stand in a privileged position of being able to detect these alterations.	4
K-RasV14I recapitulates Noonan syndrome in mice. || Abnormalities, Multiple Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Animals Body Size Cell Lineage Crosses, Genetic Disease Models, Animal Dwarfism Epistasis, Genetic Face Female Genes, Dominant Genes, ras Genotype Heart Defects, Congenital Hematopoiesis Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases Male Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Mice, Mutant Strains Mutation, Missense Myeloproliferative Disorders Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Point Mutation Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Radiation Chimera Signal Transduction || Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by short stature, craniofacial dysmorphism, and congenital heart defects. NS also is associated with a risk for developing myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Mutations responsible for NS occur in at least 11 different loci including KRAS. Here we describe a mouse model for NS induced by K-Ras(V14I), a recurrent KRAS mutation in NS patients. K-Ras(V14I)-mutant mice displayed multiple NS-associated developmental defects such as growth delay, craniofacial dysmorphia, cardiac defects, and hematologic abnormalities including a severe form of MPD that resembles human JMML. Homozygous animals had perinatal lethality whose penetrance varied with genetic background. Exposure of pregnant mothers to a MEK inhibitor rescued perinatal lethality and prevented craniofacial dysmorphia and cardiac defects. However, Mek inhibition was not sufficient to correct these defects when mice were treated after weaning. Interestingly, Mek inhibition did not correct the neoplastic MPD characteristic of these mutant mice, regardless of the timing at which the mice were treated, thus suggesting that MPD is driven by additional signaling pathways. These genetically engineered K-Ras(V14I)-mutant mice offer an experimental tool for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of NS. Perhaps more importantly, they should be useful as a preclinical model to test new therapies aimed at preventing or ameliorating those deficits associated with this syndrome.	0
Ubiquitination of K-Ras enhances activation and facilitates binding to select downstream effectors. || Amino Acid Sequence Cell Line Chromatography, Affinity Guanosine Triphosphate Humans Lysine Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein Binding Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Tandem Mass Spectrometry Ubiquitination raf Kinases ras Proteins || The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)--loaded form of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ras initiates multiple signaling pathways by binding to various effectors, such as the kinase Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Ras activity is increased by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that stimulate guanosine diphosphate release and GTP loading and is inhibited by GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis. KRAS is the most frequently mutated RAS gene in cancer. Here, we report that monoubiquitination of lysine-147 in the guanine nucleotide-binding motif of wild-type K-Ras could lead to enhanced GTP loading. Furthermore, ubiquitination increased the binding of the oncogenic Gly12Val mutant of K-Ras to the downstream effectors PI3K and Raf. Thus, monoubiquitination could enhance GTP loading on K-Ras and increase its affinity for specific downstream effectors, providing a previously unidentified mechanism for Ras activation.	0
Life-long tailoring of management for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy : Awareness and decision-making in changing scenarios. ||  || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, characterised by complex pathophysiology and extensive genetic and clinical heterogeneity. In most patients, HCM is caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes and inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The clinical phenotype ranges from severe presentations at a young age to lack of left ventricular hypertrophy in genotype-positive individuals. No preventative treatment is available as the sequence and causality of the pathomechanisms that initiate and exacerbate HCM are unknown. Sudden cardiac death and end-stage heart failure are devastating expressions of this disease. Contemporary management including surgical myectomy and implantable cardiac defibrillators has shown significant impact on long-term prognosis. However, timely recognition of specific scenarios - including transition to the end-stage phase - may be challenging due to limited awareness of the progression patterns of HCM. This in turn may lead to missed therapeutic opportunities. To illustrate these difficulties, we describe two HCM patients who progressed from the typical hyperdynamic stage of asymmetric septal thickening to end-stage heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction. We highlight the different stages of this complex inherited cardiomyopathy based on the clinical staging proposed by Olivotto and colleagues. In this way, we aim to provide a practical guide for clinicians and hope to increase awareness for this common form of cardiac disease.	4
New era in treatment for phenylketonuria: Pharmacologic therapy with sapropterin dihydrochloride. ||  || Oral administration of sapropterin hydrochloride, recently approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission, is a novel approach for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU), one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. PKU is caused by an inherited deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), and the pathophysiology of the disorder is related to chronic accumulation of the free amino acid phenylalanine in tissues. Contemporary therapy is based upon restriction of dietary protein intake, which leads to reduction of blood phenylalanine levels. This therapy is difficult to maintain throughout life, and dietary noncompliance is commonplace. Sapropterin dihydrochloride is a synthetic version of tetrahydrobiopterin, the naturally occurring pterin cofactor that is required for PAH-mediated phenylalanine hydroxylation. In a subset of individuals with PAH deficiency, sapropterin administration leads to reduction in blood phenylalanine levels independent of dietary protein. For these individuals, sapropterin is an effective novel therapy for PKU.	1 3
Hereditary breast cancer and the BRCA1-associated FANCJ/BACH1/BRIP1. || BRCA1 Protein Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors Breast Neoplasms DNA Repair Fanconi Anemia Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mutation Tumor Suppressor Proteins || It is clear that FANCJ, also known as BACH1 or BRIP1, is an essential tumor suppressor gene based on the identification of clinically relevant mutations not only in breast cancer, but also the childhood cancer syndrome, Fanconi anemia. This conclusion is further supported by the direct and functional interaction between FANCJ and the hereditary breast cancer-associated gene product BRCA1. In the absence of the FANCJ DNA helicase or its interaction with BRCA1, cells have defects in several aspects of the DNA damage response. In particular, the BRCA1-FANCJ interaction is essential for promoting error-free repair, checkpoint control and for limiting DNA damage tolerance. As the number of FANCJ clinical mutations and affected patients accumulate, it will be critical to understand whether the associated tumors resemble BRCA-associated tumors. If so, FANCJ patients could also benefit from new therapies that selectively sensitize DNA repair-defective tumors and spare healthy cells. In this article, we summarize the breast cancer-associated FANCJ mutations and discuss functional outcomes for DNA repair and tumor suppression.	0
A systematic review and meta-analysis of common mutations of SLC26A4 gene in Asian populations. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group Case-Control Studies China Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Prevalence Risk Assessment Sulfate Transporters || The IVS7-2A>G (c.919-2A>G) and p.H723R (c.2168A>G) mutations of SLC26A4 gene are recognized as a risk factor for the non-syndromic hearing loss. To elucidate the variable results, a meta-analysis and systematic review was performed from all case-control studies by pooling data on them. The case-control studies were assessed with a modification of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The strength of association between c.919-2A>G, c.2168A>G and hearing loss risk was measured by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 14 case-control studies and 16 case series studies in present study. There was a higher prevalence of the c.919-2A>G mutation in the case group than that in the control group (12.4% vs 0.9%; OR = 13.05, 95% CI: 8.41-20.23, Z = 11.47, P<0.00001). In conclusion, the results from this meta-analysis suggest that NSHL patients have an increased risk of the c.919-2A>G mutation of SLC26A4 gene in Asians, especially in Chinese.	4
PALB2: the hub of a network of tumor suppressors involved in DNA damage responses. || Animals BRCA2 Protein DNA Damage Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Gene Regulatory Networks Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Tumor Suppressor Proteins || PALB2 was first identified as a partner of BRCA2 that mediates its recruitment to sites of DNA damage. PALB2 was subsequently found as a tumor suppressor gene. Inherited heterozygosity for this gene is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the breast and other sites. Additionally, biallelic mutation of PALB2 is linked to Fanconi anemia, which also has an increased risk of developing malignant disease. Recent work has identified numerous interactions of PALB2, suggesting that it functions in a network of proteins encoded by tumor suppressors. Notably, many of these tumor suppressors are related to the cellular response to DNA damage. The recruitment of PALB2 to DNA double-strand breaks at the head of this network is via a ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathway that involves the RAP80, Abraxas and BRCA1 tumor suppressors. Next, PALB2 interacts with BRCA2, which is a tumor suppressor, and with the RAD51 recombinase. These interactions promote DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). More recently, PALB2 has been found to bind the RAD51 paralog, RAD51C, as well as the translesion polymerase pol η, both of which are tumor suppressors with functions in HR. Further, an interaction with MRG15, which is related to chromatin regulation, may facilitate DNA repair in damaged chromatin. Finally, PALB2 interacts with KEAP1, a regulator of the response to oxidative stress. The PALB2 network appears to mediate the maintenance of genome stability, may explain the association of many of the corresponding genes with similar spectra of tumors, and could present novel therapeutic opportunities.	0
Hearing loss associated with 35delG mutation in Connexin-26 (GJB2) gene: audiogram analysis. || Adolescent Adult Audiometry, Pure-Tone Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Female Gene Deletion Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Phenotype Severity of Illness Index || 35delG is the most common mutation in the Connexin-26 gene, representing a major cause of autosomal recessive hearing loss. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the audiological phenotype and the 35delG mutation in 64 Sicilians with non-syndromic deafness. Pure-tone audiometry and a screening for 35delG mutation were performed. Audiograms were evaluated according to the classification of Liu and Xu. Thirteen homozygotes and nine heterozygotes for the investigated mutation were found. Symmetrical hearing loss was significantly (p=0.008) more common in homozygous subjects than in those without the Connexin-26 mutation. Profound-severe hypoacusia was found in 92.3 per cent of 35delG homozygous, 22.3 per cent of heterozygous and 58.7 per cent of 35delG absent patients. Residual shape audiograms were more frequent in homozygotes. A molecular analysis for the 35delG mutation should be performed in cases of symmetric, severe-profound congenital hearing loss, as a genetic cause is probable in such cases.	4
Case report of a 45-year old female Fabry disease patient carrying two alpha-galactosidase A gene mutation alleles. || Alleles Brain Exons Fabry Disease Female Genotype Heart Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Stroke alpha-Galactosidase || X-chromosomal inheritance patterns and generally rare occurrence of Fabry disease (FD) account for mono-mutational hemizygous male and heterozygous female patients. Female mutation carriers are usually clinically much less severely affected, which has been explained by a suggested mosaicism in cell phenotype due to random allele shutdown. However, clinical evidence is scarce and potential additional effects in female gene carriers, which might account for specific clinical characteristics such as less severe chronic kidney disease, are yet unknown. This article reports on a 45 year old female patient carrying the two alpha-galactosidase A gene mutations c.416A > G, p.N139S in exon 3 and c.708G > C, p.W236C in exon 5, but still showing only mild organ manifestations. This current case highlights the importance of careful clinical characterization in patients with Fabry disease, who may show additional rare constellations and, therefore, are in need of personalized medicine. The impact of potential additional protective effects exceeding the presence of a non-pathogenic GLA allele in female gene carriers requires further investigation.	4
QM-MM simulations on p53-DNA complex: a study of hot spot and rescue mutants. || Binding Sites Cell Proliferation DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Neoplasms Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Quantum Theory Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a transcription factor involved in the expression of a number of downstream genes in response to genotoxic stress. It is activated through post translation modifications in normal as well as cancerous cells. However, due to mutations occurring in p53 in cancer cells it is not able to perform its function of DNA binding which leads to cell proliferation. It is found to be mutated in 50% of the cancers. These mutations occur at a high frequency in the DNA binding region of the p53. Among the known seven hot spot cancer mutations G245S, R249S, and R273C have been studied here using quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM-MM) simulations. These mutations along with their experimentally proven rescue mutations have also been included in the present work. A comparative study of these cancer mutations along with wild type and their rescue mutations has been performed. A computational measure based on the free energy changes occurring in the binding of the p53 to the DNA has been presented. A correlation between the DNA binding property and important interaction between p53 and DNA has been observed for all the mutants. The keys residues which contribute to the binding of p53 to DNA by forming crucial hydrogen bonds have also been discussed in detail. A 30 ns simulation study was analyzed to observe the local structural changes and DNA binding property of p53 in case of wild type, cancer and rescue mutants.	0
Mutagenic assessment of chemotherapy and Smac mimetic drugs in cells with defective DNA damage response pathways. ||  || DNA damaging therapies can spur the formation of therapy-related cancers, due to mis-repair of lesions they create in non-cancerous cells. This risk may be amplified in patients with impaired DNA damage responses. We disabled key DNA damage response pathways using genetic and pharmacological approaches, and assessed the impact of these deficiencies on the mutagenicity of chemotherapy drugs or the "Smac mimetic" GDC-0152, which kills tumor cells by targeting XIAP, cIAP1 and 2. Doxorubicin and cisplatin provoked mutations in more surviving cells deficient in ATM, p53 or the homologous recombination effector RAD51 than in wild type cells, but suppressing non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by disabling DNA-PKcs prevented chemotherapy-induced mutagenesis. Vincristine-induced mutagenesis required p53 and DNA-PKcs but was not affected by ATM status, consistent with it provoking ATM-independent p53-mediated activation of caspases and CAD, which creates DNA lesions in surviving cells that could be mis-repaired by NHEJ. Encouragingly, GDC-0152 failed to stimulate mutations in cells with proficient or defective DNA damage response pathways. This study highlights the elevated oncogenic risk associated with treating DNA repair-deficient patients with genotoxic anti-cancer therapies, and suggests a potential advantage for Smac mimetic drugs over traditional therapies: a reduced risk of therapy-related cancers.	0
PLX4032, a selective BRAF(V600E) kinase inhibitor, activates the ERK pathway and enhances cell migration and proliferation of BRAF melanoma cells. || Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Humans Indoles Melanoma Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Structure-Activity Relationship Sulfonamides Vemurafenib || BRAF(V600E/K) is a frequent mutationally active tumor-specific kinase in melanomas that is currently targeted for therapy by the specific inhibitor PLX4032. Our studies with melanoma tumor cells that are BRAF(V600E/K) and BRAF(WT) showed that, paradoxically, while PLX4032 inhibited ERK1/2 in the highly sensitive BRAF(V600E/K), it activated the pathway in the resistant BRAF(WT) cells, via RAF1 activation, regardless of the status of mutations in NRAS or PTEN. The persistently active ERK1/2 triggered downstream effectors in BRAF(WT) melanoma cells and induced changes in the expression of a wide-spectrum of genes associated with cell cycle control. Furthermore, PLX4032 increased the rate of proliferation of growth factor-dependent NRAS Q61L mutant primary melanoma cells, reduced cell adherence and increased mobility of cells from advanced lesions. The results suggest that the drug can confer an advantage to BRAF(WT) primary and metastatic tumor cells in vivo and provide markers for monitoring clinical responses.	0

An in silico study of the molecular basis of B-RAF activation and conformational stability. || Amino Acid Substitution Computer Simulation Databases, Protein Enzyme Activation Mutation Protein Structure, Tertiary Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Software || B-RAF kinase plays an important role both in tumour induction and maintenance in several cancers and it is an attractive new drug target. However, the structural basis of the B-RAF activation is still not well understood. In this study we suggest a novel molecular basis of B-RAF activation based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of B-RAFWT and the B-RAFV600E, B-RAFK601E and B-RAFD594V mutants. A strong hydrogen bond network was identified in B-RAFWT in which the interactions between Lys601 and the well known catalytic residues Lys483, Glu501 and Asp594 play an important role. It was found that several mutations, which directly or indirectly destabilized the interactions between these residues within this network, contributed to the changes in B-RAF activity. Our results showed that the above mechanisms lead to the disruption of the electrostatic interactions between the A-loop and the alphaC-helix in the activating mutants, which presumably contribute to the flipping of the activation segment to an active form. Conversely, in the B-RAFD594V mutant that has impaired kinase activity, and in B-RAFWT these interactions were strong and stabilized the kinase inactive form.	0
ADP-ribosylation factor 6 mediates E-cadherin recovery by chemical chaperones. || ADP-Ribosylation Factors Animals CHO Cells Cadherins Catenins Cell Membrane Cricetinae Cricetulus Dimethyl Sulfoxide Endocytosis Exocytosis Humans Mutant Proteins Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor) Protein Binding Protein Stability Protein Transport RNA, Small Interfering || E-cadherin plays a powerful tumor suppressor role. Germline E-cadherin mutations justify 30% of Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) and missense mutations are found in 30% of these families. We found possible to restore in vitro mutant E-cadherin associated to HDGC syndrome by using Chemical Chaperones (CCs). Herein, our aim was to disclose the molecular mechanisms underlying the CCs effects in E-cadherin regulation. Using cells stably expressing WT E-cadherin or two HDGC-associated missense mutations, we show that upon DMSO treatment, not only mutant E-cadherin is restored and stabilized at the plasma membrane (PM), but also Arf6 and PIPKIγ expressions are altered. We show that modulation of Arf6 expression partially mimics the effect of CCs, suggesting that the cellular effects observed upon CCs treatment are mediated by Arf6. Further, we show that E-cadherin expression recovery is specifically linked to Arf6 due to its role on endocytosis and recycling pathways. Finally, we demonstrated that, as DMSO, several others CCs are able to modulate the trafficking machinery through an Arf6 dependent mechanism. Interestingly, the more effective compounds in E-cadherin recovery to PM are those that simultaneously inhibit Arf6 and stimulate PIPKIγ expression and binding to E-cadherin. Here, we present the first evidence of a direct influence of CCs in cellular trafficking machinery and we show that this effect is of crucial importance in the context of juxtamembrane E-cadherin missense mutations associated to HDGC. We propose that this influence should be taken into account when exploring the therapeutic potential of this type of chemicals in genetic diseases associated to protein-misfolding.	0
Probing potential binding modes of the p53 tetramer to DNA based on the symmetries encoded in p53 response elements. || Binding Sites Computational Biology Computer Simulation DNA DNA, Cruciform DNA, Superhelical Models, Molecular Mutation Protein Binding Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid Response Elements Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Symmetries in the p53 response-element (p53RE) encode binding modes for p53 tetramer to recognize DNA. We investigated the molecular mechanisms and biological implications of the possible binding modes. The probabilities evaluated with molecular dynamics simulations and DNA sequence analyses were found to be correlated, indicating that p53 tetramer models studied here are able to read DNA sequence information. The traditionally believed mode with four p53 monomers binding at all four DNA quarter-sites does not cause linear DNA to bend. Alternatively, p53 tetramer can use only two monomers to recognize DNA sequence and induce DNA bending. With an arrangement of dimer of AB dimer observed in p53 trimer-DNA complex crystal, p53 can recognize supercoiled DNA sequence-specifically by binding to quarter-sites one and four (H14 mode) and recognize Holliday junction geometry-specifically. Examining R273H mutation and p53-DNA interactions, we found that at least three R273H monomers are needed to disable the p53 tetramer, consistent with experiments. But just one R273H monomer may greatly shift the binding mode probabilities. Our work suggests that p53 needs balanced binding modes to maintain genome stability. Inverse repeat p53REs favor the H14 mode and direct repeat p53REs may have high possibilities of other modes.	0
Reduced H3K27me3 Expression Is Common in Nodular Melanomas of Childhood Associated With Congenital Melanocytic Nevi But Not in Proliferative Nodules. || Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Proliferation Child Child, Preschool Diagnosis, Differential Epigenesis, Genetic Female Follow-Up Studies Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Histones Humans Immunohistochemistry Infant Infant, Newborn Male Melanoma Methylation Nevus, Pigmented Skin Neoplasms || The formation of a nodule within a congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) raises concerns about possible melanoma. Most new nodular growths that develop during childhood, however, are benign proliferative nodules (PN); melanoma is very rare. The distinction of melanoma from PN can at times be difficult clinically and histopathologically, requiring ancillary molecular tests for diagnosis. Although the application of molecular methods has revealed new insights into the mutational and genomic landscape of childhood melanomas, little is known about epigenetic events that may drive the growth of a melanoma or PN in a CMN. In this study we compared the expression of H3K27me3, a key regulator in chromatin remodelling-controlled transcription, in PNs and pediatric nodular melanomas arising within medium-sized to large CMN by immunohistochemistry. Significant loss of H3K27me3 expression was seen in 4 of 5 melanomas, but not in any of the 20 PNs. This observation suggests that epigenetic events likely play a role in the pathogenesis of melanoma developing in the dermis or subcutis of CMN. Furthermore, assessing for H3K27me3 expression by immunohistochemistry may be diagnostically useful for problematic cases.	4
HNF1A mutation presenting with fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood prior to onset of overt diabetes. || Adult DNA Mutational Analysis Family Health Female Fetal Macrosomia Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Humans Hypoglycemia Male Mutation Pedigree Prediabetic State || HNF1A-MODY (MODY3) is a common subtype of autosomal dominant diabetes. Unlike HNF4-MODY where fetal macrosomia and early postnatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have been reported, history of transient insulin overproduction has not yet been recognized in individuals with HNF1A-MODY. Here, we report on a 40-year-old male patient with HNF1A mutation p.Arg272His (c.815G>A) having a history of fetal macrosomia (4750 g, 59 cm), and, at least, one attack of symptomatic hypoglycemia in childhood. Diabetes was subsequently diagnosed at 19 years of age. The proband's daughter who developed diabetes at 16 years carries the same mutation, but her birth weight and length were in the upper normal range, and she never experienced hypoglycemic symptoms. The observation of fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia in childhood is indicative of a biphasic impact of the HNF1A mutation on p-cell function over the lifespan, leading from inappropriate insulin oversecretion to final clinical diabetes.	4
Two cases with severe lethal course of Costello syndrome associated with HRAS p.G12C and p.G12D. || Costello Syndrome Fatal Outcome Female Genetic Association Studies Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mutation, Missense Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by severe failure to thrive, coarse facial appearance, cardiac and skin abnormalities, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and predisposition to malignancies. Heterozygous de novo germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS cause CS. About 80% of patients share the same mutation resulting in the amino acid change p.G12S and present a relatively homogeneous phenotype. Other less common lesions in HRAS can induce a milder phenotype on the one hand and a more severe phenotype on the other broadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations in CS-affected individuals. We report two new patients with the HRAS p.G12C and p.G12D substitutions and a severe neonatal manifestation causing death at the age of three months and 13 days, respectively. Both patients had particularly severe heart involvement with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and tachyarrhythmia, generalized edema, and respiratory distress. In one case, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was already noted prenatally. These cases together with other individuals harboring the rare HRAS mutations p.G12C, p.G12V, p.G12D, and p.G12E provide further evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation that could be of importance for counseling and medical management.	4
Identification of Genetic Mutations in Human Lung Cancer by Targeted Sequencing. ||  || Lung cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy and the primary cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Unique mutations patterns can be found in lung cancer subtypes, in individual cancers, or within a single tumor, and drugs that target these genetic mutations and signal transduction pathways are often beneficial to patients. In this study, we used the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Panel to sequence 737 loci from 45 cancer-related genes and oncogenes to identify genetic mutations in 48 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human lung cancer samples from Chinese patients. We found frequent mutations in EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and TP53 genes. Moreover, we observed that a portion of the lung cancer samples harbored two or more mutations in these key genes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the Ion Torrent sequencing to efficiently identify genetic mutations in individual tumors for targeted lung cancer therapy.	4
Intratumoral heterogeneity as a therapy resistance mechanism: role of melanoma subpopulations. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Melanoma Molecular Targeted Therapy || Malignant melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer whose incidence continues to increase worldwide. Increased exposure to sun, ultraviolet radiation, and the use of tanning beds can increase the risk of melanoma. Early detection of melanomas is the key to successful treatment mainly through surgical excision of the primary tumor lesion. But in advanced stage melanomas, once the disease has spread beyond the primary site to distant organs, the tumors are difficult to treat and quickly develop resistance to most available forms of therapy. The advent of molecular and cellular techniques has led to a better characterization of tumor cells revealing the presence of heterogeneous melanoma subpopulations. The discovery of gene mutations and alterations of cell-signaling pathways in melanomas has led to the development of new targeted drugs that show dramatic response rates in patients. Single-agent therapies generally target one subpopulation of tumor cells while leaving others unharmed. The surviving subpopulations will have the ability to repopulate the original tumors that can continue to progress. Thus, a rational approach to target multiple subpopulations of tumor cells with a combination of drugs instead of single-agent therapy will be necessary for long-lasting inhibition of melanoma lesions. In this context, the recent development of immune checkpoint reagents provides an additional armor that can be used in combination with targeted drugs to expand the presence of melanoma reactive T cells in circulation to prevent tumor recurrence.	0
Survival and associated factors in 268 adults with Pompe disease prior to treatment with enzyme replacement therapy. || Adult Aged Enzyme Replacement Therapy Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Survival Analysis Young Adult alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. The majority of adult patients have slowly progressive disease, which gradually impairs mobility and respiratory function and may lead to wheelchair and ventilator dependency. It is as yet unknown to what extent the disease reduces the life span of these patients. Our objective was to determine the survival of adults with Pompe disease not receiving ERT and to identify prognostic factors associated with survival. Data of 268 patients were collected in a prospective international observational study conducted between 2002 and 2009. Survival analyses from time of diagnosis and from time of study entry were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox-proportional-hazards regression. Median age at study entry was 48 years (range 19-79 years). Median survival after diagnosis was 27 years, while median age at diagnosis was 38 years. During follow-up, twenty-three patients died prior to ERT, with a median age at death of 55 (range 23-77 years). Use of wheelchair and/or respiratory support and patients' score on the Rotterdam Handicap Scale (RHS) were identified as prognostic factors for survival. Five-year survival for patients without a wheelchair or respiratory support was 95% compared to 74% in patients who were wheelchair-bound and used respiratory support. In a Dutch subgroup of 99 patients, we compared the observed number of deaths to the expected number of deaths in the age- and sex-matched general population. During a median follow-up of 2.3 years, the number of deaths among the Dutch Pompe patients was higher than the expected number of deaths in the general population. Our study shows for the first time that untreated adults with Pompe disease have a higher mortality than the general population and that their levels of disability and handicap/participation are the most important factors associated with mortality. These results may be of relevance when addressing the effect of ERT or other potential treatment options on survival.	1
Genetic Variants Associated with Lipid Profiles in Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes. || Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Body Mass Index Cardiovascular Diseases China Cholesterol Cholesterol, LDL Diabetes Complications Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Dyslipidemias Female Genotype Glucose Tolerance Test Humans Lipids Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Risk Factors Triglycerides || Dyslipidemia is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aim of this study was to identify lipid-related genetic variants in T2D patients of Han Chinese ancestry. Among 4,908 Chinese T2D patients who were not taking lipid-lowering medications, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes previously found to be associated with lipid traits in genome-wide association studies conducted in populations of European ancestry (ABCA1, GCKR, BAZ1B, TOMM40, DOCK7, HNF1A, and HNF4A) were genotyped. After adjusting for multiple covariates, SNPs in ABCA1, GCKR, BAZ1B, TOMM40, and HNF1A were identified as significantly associated with triglyceride levels in T2D patients (P < 0.05). The associations between the SNPs in ABCA1 (rs3890182), GCKR (rs780094), and BAZ1B (rs2240466) remained significant even after correction for multiple testing (P = 8.85×10(-3), 7.88×10(-7), and 2.03×10(-6), respectively). BAZ1B (rs2240466) also was associated with the total cholesterol level (P = 4.75×10(-2)). In addition, SNP rs157580 in TOMM40 was associated with the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = 6.94×10(-3)). Our findings confirm that lipid-related genetic loci are associated with lipid profiles in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.	4
Clinical Grade "SNaPshot" Genetic Mutation Profiling in Multiple Myeloma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cell Line, Tumor Humans Middle Aged Multiple Myeloma Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || Whole genome sequencing studies have identified several oncogenic mutations in multiple myeloma (MM). As MM progresses, it evolves genetically underscoring the need to have tools for rapid detection of targetable mutations to optimize individualized treatment. Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has developed a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved, high-throughput, genotyping platform to determine the mutation status of a panel of known oncogenes. Sequence analysis using SNaPshot on DNA extracted from bone marrow and extramedullary plasmacytomas is feasible and leads to the detection of potentially druggable mutations. Screening MM patients for somatic mutations in oncogenes may provide novel targets leading to additional therapies for this patient population.	4
Whole-exome sequencing identifies two novel mutations in KCNQ4 in individuals with nonsyndromic hearing loss. ||  || Mutations in potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 4 (KCNQ4) are etiologically linked to a type of nonsyndromic hearing loss, deafness nonsyndromic autosomal dominant 2 (DFNA2). We performed whole-exome sequencing for 98 families with hearing loss and found mutations in KCNQ4 in five families. In this study, we characterized two novel mutations in KCNQ4: a missense mutation (c.796G>T; p.Asp266Tyr) and an in-frame deletion mutation (c.259_267del; p.Val87_Asn89del). p.Asp266Tyr located in the channel pore region resulted in early onset and moderate hearing loss, whereas p.Val87_Asn89del located in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region resulted in late onset and high frequency-specific hearing loss. When heterologously expressed in HEK 293 T cells, both mutant proteins did not show defects in protein trafficking to the plasma membrane or in interactions with wild-type (WT) KCNQ4 channels. Patch-clamp analysis demonstrated that both p.Asp266Tyr and p.Val87_Asn89del mutant channels lost conductance and were completely unresponsive to KCNQ activators, such as retigabine, zinc pyrithione, and ML213. Channels assembled from WT-p.Asp266Tyr concatemers, like those from WT-WT concatemers, exhibited conductance and responsiveness to KCNQ activators. However, channels assembled from WT-p.Val87_Asn89del concatemers showed impaired conductance, suggesting that p.Val87_Asn89del caused complete loss-of-function with a strong dominant-negative effect on functional WT channels. Therefore, the main pathological mechanism may be related to loss of K+ channel activity, not defects in trafficking.	0
From identification of the BTK kinase to effective management of leukemia. || Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase Animals Humans Leukemia Protein Kinase Inhibitors Protein-Tyrosine Kinases || BTK is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase, whose corresponding gene was isolated in the early 1990s. BTK was initially identified by positional cloning of the gene causing X-linked agammaglobulinemia and independently in a search for new kinases. Given the phenotype of affected patients, namely lack of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells with the ensuing inability to mount humoral immune responses, BTK inhibitors were anticipated to have beneficial effects on antibody-mediated pathologies, such as autoimmunity. In contrast to, for example, the SRC-family of cytoplasmic kinases, there was no obvious way in which structural alterations would yield constitutively active forms of BTK, and such mutations were also not found in leukemias or lymphomas. In 2007, the first efficient inhibitor, ibrutinib, was reported and soon became approved both in the United States and in Europe for the treatment of three B-cell malignancies, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Over the past few years, additional inhibitors have been developed, with acalabrutinib being more selective, and recently demonstrating fewer clinical adverse effects. The antitumor mechanism is also not related to mutations in BTK. Instead tumor residency in lymphoid organs is inhibited, making these drugs highly versatile. BTK is one of the only 10 human kinases that carry a cysteine in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cleft. As this allows for covalent, irreversible inhibitor binding, it provides these compounds with a highly advantageous character. This quality may be crucial and bodes well for the future of BTK-modifying medicines, which have been estimated to reach annual multi-billion dollar sales in the future.	0
Polymorphisms in p53 and the p53 pathway: roles in cancer susceptibility and response to treatment. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Exons Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Mutation Neoplasms Polymorphism, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 tumour suppressor protein lies at the crossroads of multiple cellular response pathways that control the fate of the cell in response to endogenous or exogenous stresses and inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor signalling pathway is seen in most human cancers. Such aberrant p53 activity may be caused by mutations in the TP53 gene sequence producing truncated or inactive mutant proteins, or by aberrant production of other proteins that regulate p53 activity, such as gene amplification and overexpression of MDM2 or viral proteins that inhibit or degrade p53. Recent studies have also suggested that inherited genetic polymorphisms in the p53 pathway influence tumour formation, progression and/or response to therapy. In some cases, these variants are clearly associated with clinico-pathological variables or prognosis of cancer, whereas in other cases the evidence is less conclusive. Here, we review the evidence that common polymorphisms in various aspects of p53 biology have important consequences for overall tumour susceptibility, clinico-pathology and prognosis. We also suggest reasons for some of the reported discrepancies in the effects of common polymorphisms on tumourigenesis, which relate to the complexity of effects on tumour formation in combination with other oncogenic changes and other polymorphisms. It is likely that future studies of combinations of polymorphisms in the p53 pathway will be useful for predicting tumour susceptibility in the human population and may serve as predictive biomarkers of tumour response to standard therapies.	0
GJB2 (Connexin-26) mutations are not frequent among hearing impaired patients in east Greenland. ||  || Investigate genetic causes of HI among the Inuit populations in the Arctic with a high prevalence of hearing impairment (HI). A cross-sectional survey with population-based controls. Forty-five patients, with sensorineural or mixed HI and an available blood sample for GJB2 sequencing from DNA, were selected from 166 east Greenlanders by specialist audiology examination, including pure-tone air and bone conduction audiometry from 125 Hz to 8000 Hz. Controls were 108 east- and 109 west-Greenlanders. Forty-five patients with HI were included, 24 males and 21 females. Median age was 35 years (range: 5-76). The c.35delG allele frequency was 3.3%. One patient, homozygous for the c.35delG GJB2 mutation, had bilateral congenital profound HI. Another with mixed HI was heterozygous for the same mutation. Three were heterozygous for the p.V27I variant and one was heterozygous for the p.V153I variant. The frequency of the c.35delG mutation in the controls varied between 0.5% in west Greenland to 2.3% in east Greenland. The c.35delG GJB2 mutation occurs in Greenland with low frequency. We conclude the main causes behind the prevalence of HI in this population are chronic otitis media, noise traumas, and/or unidentified genetic causes.	4
Rhomboid family member 2 regulates cytoskeletal stress-associated Keratin 16. || Animals Carrier Proteins Cell Line Cell Proliferation Cytoskeleton Down-Regulation Epidermal Cells Epidermis Esophageal Neoplasms Female Fibroblasts Gain of Function Mutation Humans Keratin-16 Keratin-6 Keratinocytes Keratoderma, Palmoplantar Male Mice Mice, Knockout Pressure RNA, Small Interfering Stress, Physiological Tissue Culture Techniques Up-Regulation Wound Healing || Keratin 16 (K16) is a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein highly expressed at pressure-bearing sites of the mammalian footpad. It can be induced in hyperproliferative states such as wound healing, inflammation and cancer. Here we show that the inactive rhomboid protease RHBDF2 (iRHOM2) regulates thickening of the footpad epidermis through its interaction with K16. K16 expression is absent in the thinned footpads of irhom2-/- mice compared with irhom2+/+mice, due to reduced keratinocyte proliferation. Gain-of-function mutations in iRHOM2 underlie Tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC), characterized by palmoplantar thickening, upregulate K16 with robust downregulation of its type II keratin binding partner, K6. By orchestrating the remodelling and turnover of K16, and uncoupling it from K6, iRHOM2 regulates the epithelial response to physical stress. These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperproliferation of the palmoplantar epidermis in both physiological and disease states, and how this 'stress' keratin is regulated.	0
TP53 exon-6 truncating mutations produce separation of function isoforms with pro-tumorigenic functions. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Cyclophilins Disease Models, Animal Heterografts Humans Mice, Nude Mitochondrial Membranes Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasms Permeability Protein Isoforms Sequence Deletion Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53 truncating mutations are common in human tumors and are thought to give rise to p53-null alleles. Here, we show thatTP53 exon-6 truncating mutations occur at higher than expected frequencies and produce proteins that lack canonical p53 tumor suppressor activities but promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Functionally and molecularly, these p53 mutants resemble the naturally occurring alternative p53 splice variant, p53-psi. Accordingly, these mutants can localize to the mitochondria where they promote tumor phenotypes by binding and activating the mitochondria inner pore permeability regulator, Cyclophilin D (CypD). Together, our studies reveal thatTP53 exon-6 truncating mutations, contrary to current beliefs, act beyond p53 loss to promote tumorigenesis, and could inform the development of strategies to target cancers driven by these prevalent mutations.	0
Clinical genetics of craniosynostosis. || Craniosynostoses Genetic Counseling Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Whole Exome Sequencing || When providing accurate clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling in craniosynostosis, the challenge is heightened by knowledge that etiology in any individual case may be entirely genetic, entirely environmental, or anything in between. This review will scope out how recent genetic discoveries from next-generation sequencing have impacted on the clinical genetic evaluation of craniosynostosis. Survey of a 13-year birth cohort of patients treated at a single craniofacial unit demonstrates that a genetic cause of craniosynostosis can be identified in one quarter of cases. The substantial contributions of mutations in two genes, TCF12 and ERF, is confirmed. Important recent discoveries are mutations of CDC45 and SMO in specific craniosynostosis syndromes, and of SMAD6 in nonsyndromic midline synostosis. The added value of exome or whole genome sequencing in the diagnosis of difficult cases is highlighted. Strategies to optimize clinical genetic diagnostic pathways by combining both targeted and next-generation sequencing are discussed. In addition to improved genetic counseling, recent discoveries spotlight the important roles of signaling through the bone morphogenetic protein and hedgehog pathways in cranial suture biogenesis, as well as a key requirement for adequate cell division in suture maintenance.	4
Whole-exome sequencing identifies germline mutation in TP53 andATRX in a child with genomically aberrant AT/RT and her mother with anaplastic astrocytoma. ||  || Brain tumors typically arise sporadically and do not affect several family members simultaneously. In the present study, we describe clinical and genetic data from two patients, a mother and her daughter, with familial brain tumors. Exome sequencing revealed a germline missense mutation in the TP53 andATRX genes in both cases, and a somatic copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) inTP53 in both atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) and astrocytoma tumors.ATRX mutation was associated with the loss of ATRX protein expression. In the astrocytoma case, R132C missense mutation was found in the known hotspot site in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and LOH was detected inTP53 The mother carried few other somatic alterations, suggesting that theIDH1 mutation and LOH inTP53 were sufficient to drive tumor development. The genome in the AT/RT tumor was atypically aneuploid: Most chromosomes had experienced copy-neutral LOH or whole-chromosome gains. Only Chromosome 18 had normal diploid status.INI1/hSNF5/SMARCB1 was homozygously deleted in the AT/RT tumor. This report provides further information about tumor development in a predisposed genetic background and describes two special Li-Fraumeni cases with a familial brain tumor.	4
HOXA5 and p53 cooperate to suppress lung cancer cell invasion and serve as good prognostic factors in non-small cell lung cancer. ||  || Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and tumor metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related death. Our previous study suggested that Homeobox A5 (HOXA5) could inhibit lung cancer cell invasion via regulating cytoskeletal remodeling and involved in tumor metastasis. Recently, consensus HOX binding sites was found in the p53 gene promoter region. However, whether the HOXA5 could cooperate with p53 and contribute the inhibition of lung cancer cell invasion is still unclear. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the correlation of HOXA5 and p53 in tumor invasion and its prognostic influence in lung cancer patient specimens. Totally 71 cases of primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were collected. The median follow-up period is 6.8 years. Immunohistochemical stain for p53 and HOXA5 were performed. Kaplan-Meier plot was done for overall survival analysis. In addition, lung cancer cell lines transfected with wild-type or mutated p53 constructs were overexpressed with HOXA5 for invasion assay. In human specimens, HOXA5 expressed mainly in the cytoplasm (54.1%) rather than nuclei (14.6%) of the NSCLC tumor part. The HOXA5 expression is higher in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.001). In addition, poor prognosis is seen in group with both non-immunoreactive for p53 and HOXA5. HOXA5 and p53 could cooperate to inhibit tumor cell invasion significantly partly by decreasing MMP2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Our studies provide new insights into how HOXA5 and p53 cooperate to contribute to the suppression of lung cancer cell invasion and play good prognostic roles in NSCLC.	0
Structural mutation analysis of PTEN and its genotype-phenotype correlations in endometriosis and cancer. || Amino Acid Sequence Catalytic Domain Conserved Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Databases, Genetic Endometrial Neoplasms Endometriosis Female Gene Expression Genetic Association Studies Genotype Humans Kinetics Models, Molecular Mutation, Missense Ovarian Neoplasms PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phenotype Protein Domains Protein Stability Protein Structure, Secondary Sequence Alignment Static Electricity || The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene encodes a tumor suppressor phosphatase that has recently been found to be frequently mutated in patients with endometriosis, endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer. Here, we present the first computational analysis of 13 somatic missense PTEN mutations associated with these phenotypes. We found that a majority of the mutations are associated in conserved positions within the active site and are clustered within the signature motif, which contain residues that play a crucial role in loop conformation and are essential for catalysis. In silico analyses were utilized to identify the putative effects of these mutations. In addition, coarse-grained models of both wild-type (WT) PTEN and mutants were constructed using elastic network models to explore the interplay of the structural and global dynamic effects that the mutations have on the relationship between genotype and phenotype. The effects of the mutations reveal that the local structure and interactions affect polarity, protein structure stability, electrostatic surface potential, and global dynamics of the protein. Our results offer new insight into the role in which PTEN missense mutations contribute to the molecular mechanism and genotypic-phenotypic correlation of endometriosis, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer.

Expanded genetic screening panel for the Ashkenazi Jewish population. || Female Gene Frequency Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Jews Male Mutation Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis || Carrier screening programs that identify the presence of known mutations have been effective for reducing the incidence of autosomal recessive conditions in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population and other populations. Yet, these programs have not realized their full potential. Furthermore, many known autosomal recessive and dominant conditions are not screened for and the molecular basis of other conditions for which screening might be offered is unknown. Through literature review and annotation of full sequenced genomes from healthy individuals, we expanded the list of mutations. Mutations were identified in a sample of 128 fully sequenced AJ genomes that were filtered through clinical databases and curated manually for clinical validity and utility using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics scoring (ACMG) system. Other known mutations were identified through literature review. A panel of 163 mutations was identified for 76 autosomal recessive, 24 autosomal dominant, and 3 X-linked disorders. Screening for a broader range of disorders not only could further reduce the incidence of autosomal recessive disorders but also could offer the benefits of early or presymptomatic diagnosis.Genet Med 18 5, 522-528.	4
Clinical spectrum and outcomes in families with coronal synostosis and TCF12 mutations. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Nuclear Proteins Pedigree Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Synostosis Twist-Related Protein 1 || TCF12 mutations have been reported very recently in coronal synostosis. We report several cases of familial coronal synostosis among four families harbouring novel TCF12 mutations. We observed a broad interfamilial phenotypic spectrum with features overlapping with the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. TCF12 molecular testing should be considered in patients with unilateral- or bilateral-coronal synostosis associated or not with syndactyly, after having excluded mutations in the TWIST1 gene and the p.Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3.	4
Muenke syndrome. || Arginine Bone and Bones Craniosynostoses Facies Female Genes, Dominant History, 20th Century Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation Penetrance Proline Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor Syndrome Tomography, X-Ray Computed || Muenke syndrome is a genetically determined craniosynostosis that involves one or both coronal sutures. In some patients it is associated with skeletal abnormalities such as thimble-like middle phalanges, coned epiphysis, and/or neurological impairment, namely sensorineural hearing loss or mental retardation. In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic of this disease. Because of the incomplete penetrance of this anomaly, the suspicion of Muenke syndrome must be raised in any child with uni- or bilateral coronal craniosynostosis, and the genetic analysis propounded even in the absence of extracranial features. We report the cases of two sisters who presented with Muenke syndrome and whose affected mother did not have any form of craniosynostosis.	4
A rare mutation in ABCC8/SUR1 leading to altered ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity and beta-cell glucose sensing is associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. || ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters Adult Calcium Cell Line Cytoplasm Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Electrophysiology Exons Humans Hyperglycemia Insulin-Secreting Cells KATP Channels Kidney Membrane Potentials Mutation Patch-Clamp Techniques Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying Receptors, Drug Sulfonylurea Receptors || ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels) link glucose metabolism to the electrical activity of the pancreatic beta-cell to regulate insulin secretion. Mutations in either the Kir6.2 or sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1 subunit of the channel have previously been shown to cause neonatal diabetes. We describe here an activating mutation in the ABCC8 gene, encoding SUR1, that is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes only in adults. Recombinant K(ATP) channel subunits were expressed using pIRES2-based vectors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 or INS1(832/13) cells and the subcellular distribution of c-myc-tagged SUR1 channels analyzed by confocal microscopy. K(ATP) channel activity was measured in inside-out patches and plasma membrane potential in perforated whole-cell patches. Cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] was imaged using Fura-Red. A mutation in ABCC8/SUR1, leading to a Y356C substitution in the seventh membrane-spanning alpha-helix, was observed in a patient diagnosed with hyperglycemia at age 39 years and in two adult offspring with impaired insulin secretion. Single K(ATP) channels incorporating SUR1-Y356C displayed lower sensitivity to MgATP (IC(50) = 24 and 95 micromol/l for wild-type and mutant channels, respectively). Similar effects were observed in the absence of Mg(2+), suggesting an allosteric effect via associated Kir6.2 subunits. Overexpression of SUR1-Y356C in INS1(832/13) cells impaired glucose-induced cell depolarization and increased in intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration, albeit more weakly than neonatal diabetes-associated SUR1 mutants. An ABCC8/SUR1 mutation with relatively minor effects on K(ATP) channel activity and beta-cell glucose sensing causes diabetes in adulthood. These data suggest a close correlation between altered SUR1 properties and clinical phenotype.	0
[Analysis on GJB2 gene mutations with nonsyndromic hearing impairment in Kazak patients of Xinjiang]. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Ethnic Groups Humans Infant Mutation Young Adult || To study mutations in the GJB2 gene in Kazak patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment from Xinjiang. One hundred and ninety-three cases of Kazak from the Xinjiang region, including 97 cases of hearing loss and 96 cases of normal people, were performed mutational analysis of the GJB2 coding region by PCR-direct sequencing. Eight kinds of mutation were found in the encoding region of hearing impairment group:12 cases of 35 delG homozygous, 5 cases of 79G>A homozygous, 8 cases of 79G>A heterozygous, 1 case of 79G>A heterozygous and 608T>C heterozygous, 5 cases of 79G>A heterozygous and 341A>G heterozygous, 4 cases of 235 delC heterozygous, 2 cases of 341A>G heterozygous, 1 case of 439T>G heterozygous, 1 cases of 457G> A heterozygous, 2 cases of 521G>A homozygous. Four kinds of mutations found in the normal group were confirmed as common polymorphic mutation. The study suggests that the GJB2 gene mutation of the Kazak deaf population in Xinjiang has ethnic and regional characteristics. There is a rather high carrier frequency of GJB2 mutation of Kazak patients in Xinjiang. In this study the 35 delG mutation is a common mutation of Kazak patients.	4
Clinical Validation of a Multiplex Kit for RAS Mutations in Colorectal Cancer: Results of the RASKET (RAS KEy Testing) Prospective, Multicenter Study. || Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Endpoint Determination Exons Genotyping Techniques Humans Mutation Mutation Rate Prospective Studies Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Reagent Kits, Diagnostic Reference Standards || RAS (KRAS and NRAS) testing is required to predict anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Although direct sequencing (DS) with manual microdissection (MMD) is widely used, a diagnostic kit providing rapid detections of RAS mutations would be clinically beneficial. We evaluated the MEBGEN(TM) RASKET KIT (RASKET KIT), a multiplex assay using PCR-reverse sequence specific oligonucleotide and xMAP(®) technology to concurrently detect exon 2, 3, and 4 RAS mutations in a short turnaround time (4.5 h/96-specimens). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were obtained from 308 consenting patients with histologically-confirmed CRC at six hospitals in Japan. For the RASKET KIT, we used only 50-100 ng DNA from each FFPE specimen not processed by MMD. The primary endpoint was the concordance rate between RAS mutations identified with the RASKET KIT and two reference assays (DS with MMD and TheraScreen(®) K-RAS Mutation Kit). As the secondary endpoints, we evaluated the concordance rate between DS and the RASKET KIT for RAS mutations in the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population and the genotyping performance of the RASKET KIT compared with DS. Among 307 analyzable specimens, the reference assays detected 140 (45.6%, 140/307) RAS mutations: 111 KRAS exon 2 and 29 other (minor) RAS mutations. The RASKET KIT detected 143 (46.6%, 143/307) mutations: 114 KRAS exon 2 and 29 minor RAS mutations. The between-method concordance rate was 96.7% (297/307) (95% CI: 94.1-98.4%). Minor RAS mutations were detected in 15.7% (30/191) of the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population (n = 191); the concordance rate was 98.4% (188/191) (95% CI: 95.5-99.7%). The concordance rate of RAS genotyping was 100% (139/139) (95% CI: 97-100%). The RASKET KIT provides rapid and precise detections of RAS mutations and consequently, quicker and more effective anti-EGFR therapy for CRC (Study ID: UMIN000011784).

Palatal and oral manifestations of Muenke syndrome (FGFR3-related craniosynostosis). || Cleft Lip Cleft Palate Craniosynostoses Female Hearing Loss Humans Incidence Male Malocclusion Otitis Media with Effusion Palate, Hard Retrospective Studies United States || Although Muenke syndrome is the most common syndromic form of craniosynostosis, the frequency of oral and palatal anomalies including high-arched palate, cleft lip with or without cleft palate has not been documented in a patient series of Muenke syndrome to date. Further, to our knowledge, cleft lip and palate has not been reported yet in a patient with Muenke syndrome (a previous patient with isolated cleft palate has been reported). This study sought to evaluate the frequency of palatal anomalies in patients with Muenke syndrome through both a retrospective investigation and literature review. A total of 21 patients who met criteria for this study were included in the retrospective review. Fifteen patients (71%) had a structural anomaly of the palate. Cleft lip and palate was present in 1 patient (5%). Other palatal findings included high-arched hard palate in 14 patients (67%). Individuals with Muenke syndrome have the lowest incidence of cleft palate among the most common craniosynostosis syndromes. However, high-arched palate in Muenke syndrome is common and may warrant clinical attention, as these individuals are more susceptible to recurrent chronic otitis media with effusion, dental malocclusion, and hearing loss.	4
[PTEN and NBS1 gene mutations in familial breast cancer and early-onset breast cancer from Hunan Province in China]. ||  || To investigate the profile and potential significance of PTEN and NBS1 mutations among patients with familial or at early onset breast cancer in Hunan province. A total of 131 breast cancer patients with familial history or suffered from breast cancer at the age of less than 35 years old were included in this study. A comprehensive phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and nibrin (NBS1) mutation analysis was performed through denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and subsequent DNA direct sequencing. Among 131 patients, a reported mutation IVS4+109insTCTTA in PTEN gene were identified in two patients. The mutation frequency of IVS4+109insTCTTA was 1.15%. Two mutations in PTEN gene, 225 A>C (Thr 160 Pro) and IVS5+13T>C, was firstly discovered. Another reported missense mutation was rs121909229 G>A (Arg 130 Gln). Three mutations were detected in NBS1 gene, of which IVS6+43A>G and IVS6+127A>G were firstly discovered and another reported synonymous mutations was rs1805794 G>C (Glu 185 Gln). The novel mutations in PTEN and NBS1 might be specific to the familial and early-onset breast cancer of Chinese Hunan population.	4
p73 expression is regulated by ribosomal protein RPL26 through mRNA translation and protein stability. || 3' Untranslated Regions Binding Sites CRISPR-Cas Systems Colonic Neoplasms Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F Gene Editing Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells Half-Life Humans Protein Stability Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 RNA Interference RNA, Messenger Ribosomal Proteins Transfection Tumor Protein p73 || p73, a p53 family tumor suppressor, is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including transcription and mRNA and protein stability. However, whether p73 expression is regulated via mRNA translation has not been explored. To test this, we examined whether ribosomal protein 26 (RPL26) plays a role in p73 expression. Here, we showed that p73 expression is controlled by RPL26 via protein stability and mRNA translation. To examine whether MDM2 mediates RPL26 to regulate p73 protein stability, we generated multiple MDM2-knockout cell lines by CRISPR-cas9. We found that in the absence of MDM2, the half-life of p73 protein is markedly increased. Interestingly, we also found that RPL26 is still capable of regulating p73 expression, albeit to a lesser extent, in MDM2-KO cells compared to that in isogenic control cells, suggesting that RPL26 regulates p73 expression via multiple mechanisms. Indeed, we found that RPL26 is necessary for efficient assembly of polysomes on p73 mRNA and de novo synthesis of p73 protein. Consistently, we found that RPL26 directly binds to p73 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and that RPL26 is necessary for efficient expression of an eGFP reporter that carries p73 3'UTR. We also found that RPL26 interacts with cap-binding protein eIF4E and enhances the association of eIF4E with p73 mRNA, leading to increased p73 mRNA translation. Finally, we showed that knockdown of RPL26 promotes, whereas ectopic expression of RPL26 inhibits, cell growth in a TAp73-dependent manner. Together, our data indicate that RPL26 regulates p73 expression via two distinct mechanisms: protein stability and mRNA translation.	0
Genetic determinants of lipid traits in diverse populations from the population architecture using genomics and epidemiology (PAGE) study. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Continental Population Groups Female Gene Frequency Genetics, Population Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Linkage Disequilibrium Lipid Metabolism Lipoproteins, HDL Lipoproteins, LDL Male Middle Aged Molecular Epidemiology Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Quantitative Trait Loci Risk Factors Triglycerides Young Adult || For the past five years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of common variants associated with human diseases and traits, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) levels. Approximately 95 loci associated with lipid levels have been identified primarily among populations of European ancestry. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study was established in 2008 to characterize GWAS-identified variants in diverse population-based studies. We genotyped 49 GWAS-identified SNPs associated with one or more lipid traits in at least two PAGE studies and across six racial/ethnic groups. We performed a meta-analysis testing for SNP associations with fasting HDL-C, LDL-C, and ln(TG) levels in self-identified European American (~20,000), African American (~9,000), American Indian (~6,000), Mexican American/Hispanic (~2,500), Japanese/East Asian (~690), and Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (~175) adults, regardless of lipid-lowering medication use. We replicated 55 of 60 (92%) SNP associations tested in European Americans at p<0.05. Despite sufficient power, we were unable to replicate ABCA1 rs4149268 and rs1883025, CETP rs1864163, and TTC39B rs471364 previously associated with HDL-C and MAFB rs6102059 previously associated with LDL-C. Based on significance (p<0.05) and consistent direction of effect, a majority of replicated genotype-phentoype associations for HDL-C, LDL-C, and ln(TG) in European Americans generalized to African Americans (48%, 61%, and 57%), American Indians (45%, 64%, and 77%), and Mexican Americans/Hispanics (57%, 56%, and 86%). Overall, 16 associations generalized across all three populations. For the associations that did not generalize, differences in effect sizes, allele frequencies, and linkage disequilibrium offer clues to the next generation of association studies for these traits.	4
The new platinum(IV) derivative LA-12 shows stronger inhibitory effect on Hsp90 function compared to cisplatin. || Amantadine Antineoplastic Agents Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins Humans Immunoprecipitation Organoplatinum Compounds Spectrophotometry, Atomic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cisplatin and its derivatives are commonly used anti-cancer drugs. However, cisplatin has clinical limitations including serious side effects and frequent emergence of intrinsic or acquired resistance. Thus, the novel platinum(IV) complex LA-12 represents a promising treatment modality, which shows increased intracellular penetration resulting in improved cytotoxicity in various cancer cell lines, including cisplatin resistant cells. LA-12 disrupts cellular proliferation regardless of the p53 status in the cells, however the potency of the drug is greatly enhanced by the presence of a functional p53, indicating several mechanisms of action. Similarly to cisplatin, an interaction of LA-12 with molecular chaperone Hsp90 was proposed. Binding of LA-12 to Hsp90 was demonstrated by Hsp90 immunoprecipitation followed by platinum measurement using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). An inhibitory effect of LA-12 on Hsp90 chaperoning function was shown by decrease of Hsp90-assisted wild-type p53 binding to p21WAF1 promoter sequence in vitro and by accelerated ubiqutination and degradation of primarily unfolded mutant p53 proteins in cells exposed to LA-12. To generalize our findings, LA-12 induced degradation of other Hsp90 client proteins such as Cyclin D1 and estrogen receptor was shown and proved as more efficient in comparison with cisplatin. This newly characterised molecular mechanism of action opens opportunities to design new cancer treatment strategy profitable from unique LA-12 properties, which combine DNA damaging and Hsp90 inhibitory effects.	0
Multiplex genomic profiling of non-small cell lung cancers from the LETS phase III trial of first-line S-1/carboplatin versus paclitaxel/carboplatin: results of a West Japan Oncology Group study. || Adult Aged Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Carboplatin Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Combinations Female Gene Expression Profiling Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Kaplan-Meier Estimate Lung Neoplasms Male Mass Spectrometry Middle Aged Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Mutation Oxonic Acid Paclitaxel Tegafur || Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens were collected from advanced NSCLC patients enrolled in LETS phase III trial comparing first-line S-1/carboplatin with paclitaxel/carboplatin and subjected to multiplex genotyping for 214 somatic hotspot mutations in 26 genes (LungCarta Panel) and 20 major variants of ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusion genes (LungFusion Panel) with the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. MET amplification was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A somatic mutation in at least one gene was identified in 48% of non-squamous cell carcinoma and 45% of squamous cell carcinoma specimens, with EGFR (17%), TP53 (11%), STK11 (9.8%), MET (7.6%), and KRAS (6.2%). Mutations in EGFR or KRAS were associated with a longer or shorter median overall survival, respectively. The LungFusion Panel identified ALK fusions in six cases (2.5%), ROS1 fusions in five cases (2.1%), and a RET fusion in one case (0.4%), with these three types of rearrangement being mutually exclusive. Nine (3.9%) of 229 patients were found to be positive for de novo MET amplification. This first multiplex genotyping of NSCLC associated with a phase III trial shows that MassARRAY-based genetic testing for somatic mutations and fusion genes performs well with nucleic acid derived from FFPE specimens of NSCLC tissue.	4
Profiling of somatic mutations in phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma by targeted next generation sequencing analysis. ||  || At least 12 genes (FH, HIF2A, MAX, NF1, RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, TMEM127, and VHL) have been implicated in inherited predisposition to phaeochromocytoma (PCC), paraganglioma (PGL), or head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) and a germline mutation may be detected in more than 30% of cases. Knowledge of somatic mutations contributing to PCC/PGL/HNPGL pathogenesis has received less attention though mutations in HRAS, HIF2A, NF1, RET, and VHL have been reported. To further elucidate the role of somatic mutation in PCC/PGL/HNPGL tumourigenesis, we employed a next generation sequencing strategy to analyse "mutation hotspots" in 50 human cancer genes. Mutations were identified for HRAS (c.37G>C; p.G13R and c.182A>G; p.Q61R) in 7.1% (6/85); for BRAF (c.1799T>A; p.V600E) in 1.2% (1/85) of tumours; and for TP53 (c.1010G>A; p.R337H) in 2.35% (2/85) of cases. Twenty-one tumours harboured mutations in inherited PCC/PGL/HNPGL genes and no HRAS, BRAF, or TP53 mutations occurred in this group. Combining our data with previous reports of HRAS mutations in PCC/PGL we find that the mean frequency of HRAS/BRAF mutations in sporadic PCC/PGL is 8.9% (24/269) and in PCC/PGL with an inherited gene mutation 0% (0/148) suggesting that HRAS/BRAF mutations and inherited PCC/PGL genes mutations might be mutually exclusive. We report the first evidence for BRAF mutations in the pathogenesis of PCC/PGL/HNPGL.	4
Germline mutations of the E-cadherin gene in families with inherited invasive lobular breast carcinoma but no diffuse gastric cancer. || Breast Neoplasms Cadherins Carcinoma, Lobular Female Gastrectomy Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Middle Aged Pedigree Stomach Neoplasms || Present data are highly suggestive but do not unequivocally prove the cosegregation of germ-line CDH1 mutations with inherited invasive lobular breast cancer (ILBC). Two Caucasian families with 6 pathologically confirmed ILBC cases but no diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) were identified in our oncogenetics consultations. Screening for mutations of CDH1, BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes was performed on blood samples. When available, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses were performed on tumor samples. No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation was found. Deleterious CDH1 germ-line mutations c.283C>T and c.1582del were found in all the 4 living women with ILBC in family 1 and family 2, respectively. The mutation c.283C>T was also present in a healthy 71-year-old male and 2 obligate carriers in family 1. No DGC was observed in the 2 families. Loss of the wild-type CDH1 allele in 1 of the breast tumors was confirmed by LOH and IHC studies, in accordance with the "2-hit" model of tumor suppressor genes. Germline CDH1 mutation can be cosegregated with ILBC in the absence of DGC. Present data do not support recommendation of prophylactic gastrectomy in CDH1 germline mutation carriers with ILBC.

Individualized Molecular Analyses Guide Efforts (IMAGE): A Prospective Study of Molecular Profiling of Tissue and Blood in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Biopsy DNA, Neoplasm Drug Therapy Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Proteins Precision Medicine Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms || The clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in breast cancer has not been demonstrated. We hypothesized that we could perform NGS of a new biopsy from patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in a clinically actionable timeframe. We planned to enroll 40 patients onto a prospective study, Individualized Molecular Analyses Guide Efforts (IMAGE), to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining a new biopsy of a metastatic site, perform NGS (FoundationOne), and convene a molecular tumor board to formulate treatment recommendations within 28 days. We collected blood at baseline and at time of restaging to assess cell-free circulating plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA). We enrolled 26 women with metastatic TNBC who had received ≥1 line of prior chemotherapy, and 20 (77%) underwent NGS of a metastatic site biopsy. Twelve (60%) evaluable patients received treatment recommendations within 28 days of consent. The study closed after 20 patients underwent NGS, based on protocol-specified interim futility analysis. Three patients went on to receive genomically directed therapies. Twenty-four of 26 patients had genetic alterations successfully detected in ptDNA. Among 5 patients, 4 mutations found in tumor tissues were not identified in blood, and 4 mutations found in blood were not found in corresponding tumors. In 9 patients, NGS of follow-up blood samples showed 100% concordance with baseline blood samples. This study demonstrates challenges of performing NGS on prospective tissue biopsies in patients with metastatic TNBC within 28 days, while also highlighting the potential use of blood as a more time-efficient and less invasive method of mutational assessment.

Transcriptional repression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule contributes to p53 control of breast cancer invasion. || Antigens, Neoplasm Base Sequence Binding Sites Breast Neoplasms Cell Adhesion Molecules Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells Humans Molecular Sequence Data Neoplasm Invasiveness Protein Conformation Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a tumor suppressor gene with well-characterized roles in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and maintenance of genome stability. Recent evidence suggests that p53 may also contribute to the regulation of migration and invasion. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in the majority of human epithelial carcinomas, including breast and colorectal carcinomas. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that p53 interacts with a candidate p53 binding site within the EpCAM gene. p53-mediated transcriptional repression of EpCAM was confirmed in gain-of-function and loss-of-function experimental systems. Induction of wild-type p53 was associated with a significant dose-dependent decrease in EpCAM expression; conversely, specific ablation of p53 was associated with a significant increase in EpCAM expression. At the functional level, specific ablation of p53 expression is associated with increased breast cancer invasion, and this effect is abrogated by concomitant specific ablation of EpCAM expression. Taken together, these biochemical and functional data are the first demonstration that (a) wild-type p53 protein binds to a response element within the EpCAM gene and negatively regulates EpCAM expression, and (b) transcriptional repression of EpCAM contributes to p53 control of breast cancer invasion.	0
Familial Myelodysplastic/Acute Leukemia Syndromes-Myeloid Neoplasms with Germline Predisposition. ||  || Although most cases of myeloid neoplasms are sporadic, a small subset has been associated with germline mutations. The 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification included these cases in a myeloid neoplasm group with a predisposing germline mutational background. These patients must have a different management and their families should get genetic counseling. Cases identification and outline of the major known syndromes characteristics will be discussed in this text.	4
[Screening of LDLR gene mutations in nine patients with familial hypercholesterolemia]. ||  || To screen for LDLR gene mutations in 9 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). All exons of the LDLR gene and flanking intronic sequences were amplified by PCR and subjected to automatic DNA sequencing. For patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, parental DNA sequencing or T cloning sequencing was carried out to determine the parental origin of the mutant alleles. Direct sequencing of PCR products revealed 8 LDLR variants in 7 patients, which included c.259T>G, c.513delC, c.530C>T, c.682G>T, c.763C>T, c.1187-10G>A, c.1948delG, and c.1730G>A, among which c.1948delG was novel. Four patients have carried heterozygous mutations, two carried homozygous mutations, and one carried compound heterozygous mutations. The patients with biallelic mutations presented with a more severe phenotype compared those carrying heterozygous mutations. LDLR mutations were identified in 7 out of 9 patients with FH. Among the 8 identified LDLR mutations, c.1948delG was firstly reported. Above findings have expanded the mutation spectrum of LDLR gene.	4
[Characteristics of PAH gene variants among 113 phenylketonuria patients from Henan Province]. ||  || To explore the characteristics of PAH gene variants among 113 phenylketonuria patients from Henan Province. The 13 exons of the PAH gene were subjected to PCR amplification and direct sequencing. Large fragment deletion and duplication of the PAH gene were detected with a multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. In total 195 point variants and 3 large fragment deletions were detected among the 226 alleles, with the detection rates being 86.28% and 1.33%, respectively. Variants of p.Arg243Gln (18.14%), p.Arg111X (6.19%), p.Arg53His (5.31%), EX6-96A>G (5.31%), p.Tyr356X (4.87%) and p.Val399Val (4.42%) were relatively common. Most of the variants were located in exons 7, 11, 3 and 6. Missense variations were most common. Four novel variations were detected, which included c.1016C>A (p.Ser339Tyr), c.1000T>C (p.Cys334Arg), c.1110G>T (p.Glu370Asp), and IVS6+1G>T. The PAH gene variations in Henan Province have featured extensive allelic heterogeneity and variety.	3
[Genetic diagnosis of phenylketonuria. III. Mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in Orientals]. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by lesions in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. The recent studies on PAH mutations show the genetic drift of PKU alleles among some Oriental populations. Therefore, we searched for PKU mutations among Japanese, Chinese and Taiwanese. Direct sequencing was conducted on DNA fragments amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using solid-phase technology involving the biotin-streptavidin system. Two new mutations (R241C and G247V) and two of the known mutant alleles (Y204C and R243Q) were found in two Taiwanese and two Chinese PKU patients, and three known mutations (R111X, Y204C and R413P) were recognized in three Japanese; two new mutations were identified in exon 7 of the PAH gene at codon 241 and codon 247, where the single base changes from C to T and from G to T substituted cysteine for arginine and valine for glycine, respectively. Further all the PAH mutations detected are common in Oriental populations as they have been thus far unreported among Caucasians. From these data as well as the clinical phenotype of the patients, we suggest that the R241C and G247V substitutions may interfere with proper enzyme function, although we have not yet performed functional studies. More detailed studies would be needed to clarify the regional distribution of mutant chromosomes in Oriental populations and other unidentified mutations.	3
[Genetic diagnosis of phenylketonuria. IV. Mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in Caucasian and Gypsy populations in Czech and Slovakia Republics]. ||  || Direct sequencing was conducted on the regions of the exon 7 and 12 in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using solid-phase technology involving the biotin streptavidin system. A novel mutation and seven previously known mutations were identified in the PAH genes among 15 Caucasians and 10 Gypsies in the Czech and Slovakia republics, affected with classical phenylketonuria (PKU). Two of these substitutions (R243X and G272X) resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon, and a single base transition of G to A at codon 261 resulted in the substitution of Arg for Gln (R261Q). These three mutations together accounted for 16.7% of PKU alleles among 15 Caucasians. The R252W mutation was detected in these two groups: two Caucasians were compound heterozygous for the P281L or R408W mutations (6.7% of all mutant alleles). However, all 10 Gypsy PKU patients were homozygous for the R252W transition. The R408W mutation accounted for 43% of PKU alleles in 15 Caucasian PKU patients. A novel heterozygous C-to-G transversion at the third base of codon 263 in the exon 7, resulting in the substitution of Phe for Leu (F263L), was detected in a Caucasian PKU patient (3.3% of all mutant alleles). In this study, we revealed a novel PKU mutation of the F263L in Caucasian populations and a high-risk PKU mutation of the R252W in Gypsy populations.	3
Performance evaluation of the TheraTyper-GJB2 assay for detection of GJB2 gene mutations. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Dried Blood Spot Testing Hearing Loss Humans Mutation Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization || Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of congenital hearing loss in many populations. This study describes the development of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based minisequencing assay, TheraTyper-GJB2, for the detection of c.35delG, c.167delT, and c.235delC mutations in the GJB2 gene. This assay was evaluated for analytic performance, including detection limit, interference, cross-reactivity, and precision, using GJB2 reference standards prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of a molecular clone. The detection limit was as low as 0.040 ng of human genomic DNA per PCR. No cross-reactivity with bacteria and viruses and no negative effects of increased levels of various potential interfering substances was observed. A precision test involving repetitive analysis of 2400 replicates showed 99.9% agreement (2397 of 2,400) with 99.8% (95% CI, 99.7%-99.8%) sensitivity and 100.0% (95% CI, 99.3%-100.0%) specificity. TheraTyper-GJB2 and direct sequencing assays showed 100% concordance for detecting mutations in 1,113 clinical specimens. Overall, TheraTyper-GJB2 showed comparable performance for detecting GJB2 mutations in reference and clinical samples with that of direct sequencing, and easier interpretation of results for analysis of a large quantity of samples. Therefore, the TheraTyper-GJB2 assay will be practically useful for the diagnosis of GJB2 mutations associated with congenital hearing loss with faster, cheaper, more reliable, and high-throughput capability.	4
Prognostic and therapeutic role of targetable lesions in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia without recurrent fusion genes. || Adolescent Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Lineage Child Child, Preschool Female Follow-Up Studies Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Prognosis Survival Rate Young Adult || To shed light into the molecular bases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia lacking known fusion transcripts, i.e. BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, and MLL rearrangements (B-NEG ALL) and the differences between children, adolescents/young adults (AYA) and adults, we analyzed 168 B-NEG ALLs by genome-wide technologies. This approach showed that B-NEG cases carry 10.5 mutations and 9.1 copy-number aberrations/sample. The most frequently mutated druggable pathways were those pertaining to RAS/RTK (26.8%) and JAK/STAT (12.5%) signaling. In particular, FLT3 and JAK/STAT mutations were detected mainly in AYA and adults, while KRAS and NRAS mutations were more frequent in children. RAS/RTK mutations negatively affected the outcome of AYA and adults, but not that of children. Furthermore, adult B-NEG ALL carrying JAK/STAT mutations had a shorter survival. In vitro experiments showed that FLT3 inhibitors reduced significantly the proliferation of FLT3-mutated primary B-NEG ALL cells. Likewise, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors reduced the proliferation of primary cells harboring RAS and IL7R mutations. These results refine the genetic landscape of B-NEG ALL and suggest that the different distribution of lesions and their prognostic impact might sustain the diverse outcome between children, adults and partly AYA - whose genomic scenario is similar to adults - and open the way to targeted therapeutic strategies.	4
Differential effects of PCSK9 loss of function variants on serum lipid and PCSK9 levels in Caucasian and African Canadian populations. || African Continental Ancestry Group Canada Cholesterol European Continental Ancestry Group Exons Female Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Heterozygote Humans Hypercholesterolemia Male Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Receptors, LDL Serine Endopeptidases || Variants of the secreted glycoprotein, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), associate with both hypo- and hyper-cholesterolemic phenotypes. Herein, we carried out full exonic sequencing of PCSK9 documenting the frequency of single and multiple PCSK9 variations and their effects on serum lipoprotein and PCSK9 levels in Caucasian Canadians. The 12 exons of PCSK9 were sequenced in 207 unrelated Caucasian Canadians. Minor allele frequencies of PCSK9 variants were compared amongst LDL cholesterol (LDLC) quintiles. Serum PCSK9 levels were measured by ELISA and lipoproteins by enzymatic methods. Comparisons were made with a Caucasian family cohort (n=51) and first generation African Canadians (n=31). In Caucasians, but not African Canadians, the c.61_63insCTG (denoted L10Ins) and A53V PCSK9 variations were linked and their frequency was significantly higher among Caucasian Canadians with LDLC levels in the <25th percentile. In both the unrelated and family Caucasian cohorts those carrying the L10A53V PCSK9 variant had significantly lower LDLC without reduction in plasma PCSK9. The I474V PCSK9 variant associated with significantly lower serum PCSK9 and LDLC. A novel PCSK9 variant was identified; E206K. We found that the frequency of multiple PCSK9 variations was higher in first generation African Canadians. We showed that the L10A53V and I474V PCSK9 variants were significantly associated with lower LDLC levels in Caucasian Canadians but differed in their effect on serum PCSK9 concentrations, illuminating differences in their mechanism of inaction and indicating that that PCSK9 measurement alone may not always be a good indicator of PCSK9 function.Full exonic sequencing of PCSK9 pointed to factors that may contribute to L10Ins PCSK9 variant loss of function in Canadians of Caucasian but not those of African descent. These included; (1) its tight linkage with the A53V variant in Caucasians and/or (2) for both the L10 and I474V, the combined (and negating) effect of multiple, differing phenotypic PCSK9 variants within individuals of African ancestry for which combinations of PCSK9 variations and their overall frequency was higher. No population studies, to our knowledge, have addressed or accessed the effect of multiple PCSK9 variants on cholesterol profiles. Our results indicate that this should be considered.	4
Correlation of genomic alterations assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue DNA and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC): potential clinical implications. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Renal Cell Circulating Tumor DNA DNA, Neoplasm Female Genetic Variation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Kidney Neoplasms Liquid Biopsy Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Staging || Tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing are frequently performed to detect genomic alterations (GAs) to help guide treatment in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), especially after progression on standard systemic therapy. Our objective was to assess if GAs detected by ctDNA NGS are different from those detected by tumor tissue NGS, specifically in patients with mRCC, and if these platforms are interchangeable or complimentary. When controlling for genes tested by both platforms, the median mutation rate for ctDNA was similar to tissue (median 3.0 vs. 1.0, p = 0.14). However, the concordance rate between the two platforms was only 8.6%. When comparing GAs by molecular pathway, GAs in tumor tissue were more common for the DNA repair and epigenetic pathways. Results of NGS testing from tumor tissue and ctDNA from 19 sequential mRCC patients were compared. GAs in each were statistically evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The Fischer's exact test was used to compare the incidence of mutations in selected molecular pathways. When controlling for genes tested by both platforms, similar number of GAs were detected by both tissue and ctDNA based NGS. However, there was discordance in the type of GAs detected suggesting that ctDNA NGS may be more reflective of dynamic tumor genomic heterogeneity. Hence, these two platforms may be considered complementary to each other, rather than interchangeable, for assessment of tumor GAs to guide selection of targeted clinical trial therapies.	4
Childhood adrenocortical tumours: a review. ||  || Childhood adrenocortical tumour (ACT) is not a common disease, but in southern Brazil the prevalence is 15 times higher than in other parts of the world. One hundred and thirty-seven patients have been identified and followed by our group over the past four decades. Affected children are predominantly girls, with a female-to-male ratio of 3.5:1 in patients below 4 years of age. Virilization alone (51.6%) or mixed with Cushing's syndrome (42.0%) was the predominant clinical picture observed in these patients. Tumours are unilateral, affecting both glands equally. TP53 R337H germline mutations underlie most childhood ACTs in southern Brazil. Epidemiological data from our casuistic studies revealed that this mutation has ~10% penetrance for ACT. Surgery is the definitive treatment, and a complete resection should always be attempted. Although adjuvant chemotherapy has shown some encouraging results, its influence on overall outcome is small. The survival rate is directly correlated to tumour size; patients with small, completely excised tumours have survival rates close to 90%, whereas in those patients with inoperable tumours and/or metastatic disease it is less than 10%. In the group of patients with large, excisable tumours, half of them have an intermediate outcome. Recent molecular biology techniques and genomic approaches may help us to better understand the pathogenesis of ACT, the risk of developing a tumour when TP53 R337H is present, and to predict its outcome. An ongoing pilot study consisting of close monitoring of healthy carriers of the TP53 R337H mutation - siblings and first-degree relatives of known affected cases - aims at the early detection of ACTs and an improvement of the cure rate.	4
Reproductive management through integration of PGD and MPS-based noninvasive prenatal screening/diagnosis for a family with GJB2-associated hearing impairment. || Aneuploidy Biopsy Cell-Free System Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Family Health Female Fertilization in Vitro Hearing Loss Hearing Tests Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Pregnancy Pregnancy Outcome Preimplantation Diagnosis Prenatal Diagnosis || A couple with a proband child of GJB2 (encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26)-associated hearing impairment and a previous pregnancy miscarriage sought for a reproductive solution to bear a healthy child. Our study aimed to develop a customized preconception-to-neonate care trajectory to fulfill this clinical demand by integrating preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), and noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) into the strategy. Auditory and genetic diagnosis of the proband child was carried out to identify the disease causative mutations. The couple then received in-vitro-fertilization treatment, and eight embryos were obtained for day 5 biopsy. PGD was performed by short-tandem-repeat linkage analysis and Sanger sequencing of GJB2 gene. Transfer of a GJB2c.235delC heterozygous embryo resulted in a singleton pregnancy. At the 13th week of gestation, genomic DNA (gDNA) from the trio family and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma were obtained for assessment of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and GJB2 mutations. NIPT and NIPD showed the absence of chromosomal aneuploidy and GJB2-associated disease in the fetus, which was later confirmed by invasive procedures and postnatal genetic/auditory diagnosis. This strategy successfully prevented the transmission of hearing impairment in the newborn, thus providing a valuable experience in reproductive management of similar cases and potentially other monogenic disorders.	4
A concurrent episode of two neoplasms in a toddler-age child. || Adrenocortical tumor Li Fraumeni syndrome orbital rhabdomyosarcoma || Childhood neoplasms are relatively rare and represent only about 1- 2% of the total incidence of neoplasms in United States. Concurrent episode of childhood cancer is uncommon and usually related to a cancer genetic syndrome. Li Fraumeni Syndrome refers to an autosomal dominant condition that is manifested by the development of certain cancers in early childhood and an increased lifetime risk for developing multiple primary cancers including sarcoma, breast cancer, leukemia, bone cancer, and others. We report a case of a 21-month-old girl who was found to have orbital embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and adrenocortical tumor concurrently.	4
GJB2 mutations are rare in probands with hearing loss in Chinese assortative mating families. || Adolescent Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child China Connexin 26 Connexins Consanguinity Family Female Hearing Loss Humans Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Young Adult || GJB2 mutation is recognized as the prevalent causes of non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) worldwide. However, the mutation profiles of GJB2 are rarely reported in deafness probands of the assortative mating family. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the frequencies of GJB2 mutations in probands with hearing loss in the assortative mating family in Hubei province, Central China. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of 29 probands with hearing loss. The target fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to sequencing to identify sequence variations. None of 29 probands harbored homozygous mutation in GJB2, while GJB2 heterozygous mutations c.134G>A, c.139G>T, and a deletion c.235delC were identified in three probands, respectively. GJB2 mutations are rare in Chinese probands of assortative mating families. Screening for responsible genes other than GJB2 is necessary for NSHL in these probands.	4
Malaria severity: Possible influence of the E670G PCSK9 polymorphism: A preliminary case-control study in Malian children. ||  || Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) is a hepatic secretory protein which promotes the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors leading to reduced hepatic uptake of plasma cholesterol. Non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in its gene have been linked to hypo- or hyper- cholesterolemia, depending on whether they decrease or increase PCSK9 activity, respectively. Since the proliferation and the infectivity of Plasmodium spp. partially depend on cholesterol from the host, we hypothesize that these PCSK9 genetic polymorphisms could influence the course of malaria infection in individuals who carry them. Here we examined the frequency distribution of one dominant (C679X) and two recessive (A443T, I474V) hypocholesterolemic polymorphisms as well as that of one recessive hypercholesterolemic polymorphism (E670G) among healthy and malaria-infected Malian children. Dried blood spots were collected in Bandiagara, Mali, from 752 age, residence and ethnicity-matched children: 253 healthy controls, 246 uncomplicated malaria patients and 253 severe malaria patients. Their genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped for the above PCSK9 polymorphisms using Taqman assays. Associations of genotype distributions and allele frequencies with malaria were evaluated. The minor allele frequency of the A443T, I474V, E670G, and C679X polymorphisms in the study population sample was 0.12, 0.20, 0.26, and 0.02, respectively. For each polymorphism, the genotype distribution among the three health conditions was statistically insignificant, but for the hypercholesterolemic E670G polymorphism, a trend towards association of the minor allele with malaria severity was observed (P = 0.035). The association proved to be stronger when allele frequencies between healthy controls and severe malaria cases were compared (Odd Ratio: 1.34; 95% Confidence Intervals: 1.04-1.83); P = 0.031). Carriers of the minor allele of the E670G PCSK9 polymorphism might be more susceptible to severe malaria. Further investigation of the cholesterol regulating function of PCSK9 in the pathophysiology of malaria is needed.	4
Diagnosis of Fanconi Anemia: Mutation Analysis by Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification and PCR-Based Sanger Sequencing. ||  || Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited disease characterized by developmental defects, short stature, bone marrow failure, and a high risk of malignancies. FA is heterogeneous: 15 genetic subtypes have been distinguished so far. A clinical diagnosis of FA needs to be confirmed by testing cells for sensitivity to cross-linking agents in a chromosomal breakage test. As a second step, DNA testing can be employed to elucidate the genetic subtype of the patient and to identify the familial mutations. This knowledge allows preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and enables prenatal DNA testing in future pregnancies. Although simultaneous testing of all FA genes by next generation sequencing will be possible in the near future, this technique will not be available immediately for all laboratories. In addition, in populations with strong founder mutations, a limited test using Sanger sequencing and MLPA will be a cost-effective alternative. We describe a strategy and optimized conditions for the screening of FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG and present the results obtained in a cohort of 54 patients referred to our diagnostic service since 2008. In addition, the follow up with respect to genetic counseling and carrier screening in the families is discussed.	4
Mutant p53 expression enhances drug resistance in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. || ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1 Apoptosis Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival DNA, Neoplasm Doxorubicin Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Flow Cytometry Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans In Situ Nick-End Labeling Liver Neoplasms Mutation Paclitaxel Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || Chemoresistance is a major problem in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Certain p53 mutants may enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. To determine whether two frequently occurring p53 mutants, R248Q and R273C, would increase the drug resistance of liver cancer cells, stable cell lines expressing these specific p53 mutants were established by transfecting the p53-null Hep3B cells with mutant p53 expression vectors, and then treating them with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin and paclitaxel. The cells expressing the p53 mutant, R248Q, but not R273C, displayed cross-resistance to both drugs, in contrast to the control cells expressing the vector alone. Moreover, both the expression and the activity of the multiple drug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein, were elevated in p53 mutant R248Q-expressing cells. Reduced uptake of doxorubicin was also observed in the R248Q-expressing cells. These results suggest that expression of the p53 mutant, R248Q, in liver cancer cells may enhance their drug resistance and that upregulation of P-glycoprotein activity may contribute to this protective effect.	0
Gain-of-function p53 activates multiple signaling pathways to induce oncogenicity in lung cancer cells. || Analysis of Variance Animals Carcinogenesis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Gain of Function Mutation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Histone Acetyltransferases Humans Lung Neoplasms Mediator Complex Mice Mice, Nude Neoplasm Invasiveness Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Gain-of-function (GOF) mutants of p53 upregulate genes implicated in cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Here, we report that GOF p53 induces tumorigenicity through simultaneous activation of key oncogenic pathways including those controlling putative tumor-initiating cell functions. We determined that in cells expressing p53-R273H, GOF p53 simultaneously upregulates genes from multiple signaling pathways by recognizing promoters containing distinct transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Our analytical data support a model in which GOF p53 complexes with two TFs on the promoter-a mediator protein, Med17, and a histone acetyl transferase, activating histone acetylation-and enhances gene expression to signal cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of one GOF p53-induced pathway would be insufficient to prevent tumor growth as the oncoprotein activates a multitude of parallel pathways. This discovery suggests enormous selection advantage for cancer cells with GOF p53 to induce oncogenic growth, highlighting the problems of cancer therapy.	0
Uncovering the genomic heterogeneity of multifocal breast cancer. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome-Wide Association Study High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Grading Neoplasms, Multiple Primary Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Receptor, ErbB-2 Receptors, Estrogen Retrospective Studies || Multifocal breast cancer (MFBC), defined as multiple synchronous unilateral lesions of invasive breast cancer, is relatively frequent and has been associated with more aggressive features than unifocal cancer. Here, we aimed to investigate the genomic heterogeneity between MFBC lesions sharing similar histopathological parameters. Characterization of different lesions from 36 patients with ductal MFBC involved the identification of non-silent coding mutations in 360 protein-coding genes (171 tumour and 36 matched normal samples). We selected only patients with lesions presenting the same grade, ER, and HER2 status. Mutations were classified as 'oncogenic' in the case of recurrent substitutions reported in COSMIC or truncating mutations affecting tumour suppressor genes. All mutations identified in a given patient were further interrogated in all samples from that patient through deep resequencing using an orthogonal platform. Whole-genome rearrangement screen was further conducted in 8/36 patients. Twenty-four patients (67%) had substitutions/indels shared by all their lesions, of which 11 carried the same mutations in all lesions, and 13 had lesions with both common and private mutations. Three-quarters of those 24 patients shared oncogenic variants. The remaining 12 patients (33%) did not share any substitution/indels, with inter-lesion heterogeneity observed for oncogenic mutation(s) in genes such as PIK3CA, TP53, GATA3, and PTEN. Genomically heterogeneous lesions tended to be further apart in the mammary gland than homogeneous lesions. Genome-wide analyses of a limited number of patients identified a common somatic background in all studied MFBCs, including those with no mutation in common between the lesions. To conclude, as the number of molecular targeted therapies increases and trials driven by genomic screening are ongoing, our findings highlight the presence of genomic inter-lesion heterogeneity in one-third, despite similar pathological features. This implies that deeper molecular characterization of all MFBC lesions is warranted for the adequate management of those cancers.	4
Audiologic phenotype and progression in GJB2 (Connexin 26) hearing loss. || Adolescent Alleles Audiometry Chi-Square Distribution Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Disease Progression Female Genetic Counseling Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Phenotype Polymerase Chain Reaction Prospective Studies Young Adult || To document the audiologic phenotype of children with biallelic GJB2 (connexin 26) mutations, and to correlate it with the genotype. Prospective, observational study. Tertiary care children's hospital. Infants and children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Sequencing of the GJB2 (connexin 26) gene. Degree and progression of SNHL. From December 1, 1998, through November 30, 2006, 126 children with biallelic GJB2 mutations were identified. Of the 30 different mutations identified, 13 (43%) were truncating and 17 (57%) were nontruncating; 62 patients had 2 truncating, 30 had 1 truncating and 1 nontruncating, and 17 had 2 nontruncating mutations. Eighty-four patients (67%) initially had measurable hearing in the mild to severe range in at least 1 of 4 frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, or 4000 Hz). Of these 84 patients with residual hearing, 47 (56%) had some degree of progressive hearing loss. Patients with 2 truncating mutations had significantly worse hearing compared with all other groups. Patients who had 1 or 2 copies of either an M34T or a V37I allele had the mildest hearing loss. Hearing loss owing to GJB2 mutations ranges from mild to profound and is usually congenital. More than 50% of patients will experience some hearing loss progression, generally gradually but occasionally precipitously. Hearing loss severity may be influenced by genetic factors, such as the degree of preserved protein function in nontruncating mutations, whereas hearing loss progression may be dependent on factors other than the connexin 26 protein. Genetic counseling for patients with GJB2 mutations should include the variable audiologic phenotype and the possibility of progression.	4
Intratumoral heterogeneity in a minority of ovarian low-grade serous carcinomas. || Adult Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || Ovarian low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) has fewer mutations than ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) and a less aggressive clinical course. However, an overwhelming majority of LGSC patients do not respond to conventional chemotherapy resulting in a poor long-term prognosis comparable to women diagnosed with HGSC. KRAS and BRAF mutations are common in LGSC, leading to clinical trials targeting the MAPK pathway. We assessed the stability of targetable somatic mutations over space and/or time in LGSC, with a view to inform stratified treatment strategies and clinical trial design. Eleven LGSC cases with primary and recurrent paired samples were identified (stage IIB-IV). Tumor DNA was isolated from 1-4 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from both the primary and recurrence (n = 37 tumor and n = 7 normal samples). Mutational analysis was performed using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeqTM Cancer Panel, with targeted validation using Fluidigm-MiSeq, Sanger sequencing and/or Raindance Raindrop digital PCR. KRAS (3/11), BRAF (2/11) and/or NRAS (1/11) mutations were identified in five unique cases. A novel, non-synonymous mutation in SMAD4 was observed in one case. No somatic mutations were detected in the remaining six cases. In two cases with a single matched primary and recurrent sample, two KRAS hotspot mutations (G12V, G12R) were both stable over time. In three cases with multiple samplings from both the primary and recurrent surgery some mutations (NRAS Q61R, BRAF V600E, SMAD4 R361G) were stable across all samples, while others (KRAS G12V, BRAF G469V) were unstable. Overall, the majority of cases with detectable somatic mutations showed mutational stability over space and time while one of five cases showed both temporal and spatial mutational instability in presumed drivers of disease. Investigation of additional cases is required to confirm whether mutational heterogeneity in a minority of LGSC is a general phenomenon that should be factored into the design of clinical trials and stratified treatment for this patient population.	4
Frequent germline deleterious mutations in DNA repair genes in familial prostate cancer cases are associated with advanced disease. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Repair Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Prostatic Neoplasms Risk || Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the most common diseases to affect men worldwide and among the leading causes of cancer-related death. The purpose of this study was to use second-generation sequencing technology to assess the frequency of deleterious mutations in 22 tumour suppressor genes in familial PrCa and estimate the relative risk of PrCa if these genes are mutated. Germline DNA samples from 191 men with 3 or more cases of PrCa in their family were sequenced for 22 tumour suppressor genes using Agilent target enrichment and Illumina technology. Analysis for genetic variation was carried out by using a pipeline consisting of BWA, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and ANNOVAR. Clinical features were correlated with mutation status using standard statistical tests. Modified segregation analysis was used to determine the relative risk of PrCa conferred by the putative loss-of-function (LoF) mutations identified. We discovered 14 putative LoF mutations in 191 samples (7.3%) and these mutations were more frequently associated with nodal involvement, metastasis or T4 tumour stage (P=0.00164). Segregation analysis of probands with European ancestry estimated that LoF mutations in any of the studied genes confer a relative risk of PrCa of 1.94 (95% CI: 1.56-2.42). These findings show that LoF mutations in DNA repair pathway genes predispose to familial PrCa and advanced disease and therefore warrants further investigation. The clinical utility of these findings will become increasingly important as targeted screening and therapies become more widespread.	4
The search of a genetic basis for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). || Adult Base Sequence Brazil Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Female Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Glutathione Transferase Haplotypes Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced Humans Male Middle Aged Mitochondria Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Analysis, DNA || Knowledge about the genetic factors responsible for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is still limited. This study investigated whether genetic factors are associated or not to susceptibility to NIHL. The family history and genotypes were studied for candidate genes in 107 individuals with NIHL, 44 with other causes of hearing impairment and 104 controls. Mutations frequently found among deaf individuals were investigated (35delG, 167delT in GJB2, Δ(GJB6- D13S1830), Δ(GJB6- D13S1854) in GJB6 and A1555G in MT-RNR1 genes); allelic and genotypic frequencies were also determined at the SNP rs877098 in DFNB1, of deletions of GSTM1 and GSTT1 and sequence variants in both MTRNR1 and MTTS1 genes, as well as mitochondrial haplogroups. When those with NIHL were compared with the control group, a significant increase was detected in the number of relatives affected by hearing impairment, of the genotype corresponding to the presence of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 enzymes and of cases with mitochondrial haplogroup L1. The findings suggest effects of familial history of hearing loss, of GSTT1 and GSTM1 enzymes and of mitochondrial haplogroup L1 on the risk of NIHL. This study also described novel sequence variants of MTRNR1 and MTTS1 genes.	4
Evaluation of Tetrahydrobiopterin Therapy with Large Neutral Amino Acid Supplementation in Phenylketonuria: Effects on Potential Peripheral Biomarkers, Melatonin and Dopamine, for Brain Monoamine Neurotransmitters. || Adult Amino Acids, Neutral Biomarkers Biopterin Dietary Supplements Dopamine Drug Synergism Female Humans Male Melatonin Middle Aged Phenylalanine Phenylketonurias Serotonin || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to a defective hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine (Phe) hydroxylase. Transport of the precursor amino acids from blood into the brain for serotonin and dopamine synthesis is reported to be inhibited by high blood Phe concentrations. Deficiencies of serotonin and dopamine are involved in neurocognitive dysfunction in PKU. (1) To evaluate the effects of sapropterin (BH4) and concurrent use of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) on the peripheral biomarkers, melatonin and dopamine with the hypothesis they reflect brain serotonin and dopamine metabolism. (2) To evaluate synergistic effects with BH4 and LNAA. (3) To determine the effects of blood Phe concentrations on the peripheral biomarkers concentrations. Nine adults with PKU completed our study consisting of four 4-week phases: (1) LNAA supplementation, (2) Washout, (3) BH4 therapy, and (4) LNAA with BH4 therapy. An overnight protocol measured plasma amino acids, serum melatonin, and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and dopamine in first void urine after each phase. (1) Three out of nine subjects responded to BH4. A significant increase of serum melatonin levels was observed in BH4 responders with decreased blood Phe concentration. No significant change in melatonin, dopamine or Phe levels was observed with BH4 in the subjects as a whole. (2) Synergistic effects with BH4 and LNAA were observed in serum melatonin in BH4 responders. (3) The relationship between serum melatonin and Phe showed a significant negative slope (p = 0.0005) with a trend toward differing slopes among individual subjects (p = 0.066). There was also a negative association overall between blood Phe and urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and dopamine (P = 0.040 and 0.047). Blood Phe concentrations affected peripheral monoamine neurotransmitter biomarker concentrations differently in each individual with PKU. Melatonin levels increased with BH4 therapy only when blood Phe decreased. Monitoring peripheral neurotransmitter metabolites may assist in optimizing individualized treatment in PKU.	1 3
Gene mutations in stool from gastric and colorectal neoplasia patients by next-generation sequencing. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Colorectal Neoplasms DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Early Detection of Cancer Feces Female Finland High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Stomach Neoplasms || To study cancer hotspot mutations by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in stool DNA from patients with different gastrointestinal tract (GIT) neoplasms. Stool samples were collected from 87 Finnish patients diagnosed with various gastric and colorectal neoplasms, including benign tumors, and from 14 healthy controls. DNA was isolated from stools by using the PSP® Spin Stool DNA Plus Kit. For each sample, 20 ng of DNA was used to construct sequencing libraries using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 or Ion AmpliSeq Colon and Lung Cancer panel v2. Sequencing was performed on Ion PGM. Torrent Suite Software v.5.2.2 was used for variant calling and data analysis. NGS was successful in assaying 72 GIT samples and 13 healthy controls, with success rates of the assay being 78% for stomach neoplasia and 87% for colorectal tumors. In stool specimens from patients with gastric neoplasia, five hotspot mutations were found in APC,CDKN2A andEGFR genes, in addition to seven novel mutations. From colorectal patients, 20 mutations were detected inAKT1,APC,ERBB2,FBXW7,KIT,KRAS,NRAS,SMARCB1,SMO,STK11 andTP53. Healthy controls did not exhibit any hotspot mutations, except for two novel ones.APC andTP53 were the most frequently mutated genes in colorectal neoplasms, with five mutations, followed byKRAS with two mutations.APC was the most commonly mutated gene in stools of patients with premalignant/benign GIT lesions. Our results show that in addition to colorectal neoplasms, mutations can also be assayed from stool specimens of patients with gastric neoplasms.	4
Molecular basis of Pirh2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation. || Amino Acid Sequence Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Interaction Mapping Protein Structure, Tertiary Sequence Alignment Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases Ubiquitination || Pirh2 (p53-induced RING-H2 domain protein; also known as Rchy1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in a negative-feedback loop with p53. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that Pirh2 is a unique cysteine-rich protein comprising three modular domains. The protein binds nine zinc ions using a variety of zinc coordination schemes, including a RING domain and a left-handed beta-spiral in which three zinc ions align three consecutive small beta-sheets in an interleaved fashion. We show that Pirh2-p53 interaction is dependent on the C-terminal zinc binding module of Pirh2, which binds to the tetramerization domain of p53. As a result, Pirh2 preferentially ubiquitylates the tetrameric form of p53 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that Pirh2 regulates protein turnover of the transcriptionally active form of p53.	0
Transcriptome-wide characterization of the endogenous miR-34A-p53 tumor suppressor network. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Epigenesis, Genetic Gene Expression Profiling Genes, Tumor Suppressor Homeostasis Humans Infant MicroRNAs Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic Sequence Analysis, RNA Transcriptome Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || microRNA-34A is a critical component of the p53 network and expression of miR- 34A is down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation or focal deletions in numerous human cancers. Although miR-34A deregulation may be an important driver in cancer, the endogenous role of this microRNA in cellular homeostasis is not well characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to determine the transcriptional landscape of the miR-34A-p53 axis in non-transformed cells. Using primary skin-derived fibroblast cell lines from patients who developed childhood cancers, and who harbor either germline TP53 mutations or are TP53 wild type, we sought to characterize the transcriptional response to miR-34A modulation. Through transcriptome-wide RNA-Sequencing, we show for the first time that in human non- transformed cells harboring TP53 mutations, miR-34A functions in a noncanonical manner to influence noncoding RNA networks, including RNA components of the minor (U12) spliceosome, as well as TP53-dependent and independent epigenetic pathways. miR- 34A-regulated transcripts include known cell cycle mediators and abrogation of miR-34A leads to a TP53-dependent increase in the fraction of cells in G2/M. Collectively, these results provide a framework for understanding the endogenous role of the miR-34A signaling axis and identify novel transcripts and pathways regulated by the essential miR-34A-p53 tumor suppressor network.	0
Functional studies of tyrosine hydroxylase missense variants reveal distinct patterns of molecular defects in Dopa-responsive dystonia. || Disease Progression Dystonic Disorders Enzyme Activation Enzyme Stability Gene Expression Humans Models, Molecular Mutation, Missense Protein Conformation Recombinant Proteins Solubility Substrate Specificity Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase || Congenital tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) is found in autosomal-recessive Dopa-responsive dystonia and related neurological syndromes. The clinical manifestations of THD are variable, ranging from early-onset lethal disease to mild Parkinson disease-like symptoms appearing in adolescence. Until 2014, approximately 70 THD patients with a total of 40 different disease-related missense mutations, five nonsense mutations, and three mutations in the promoter region of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene have been reported. We collected clinical and biochemical data in the literature for all variants, and also generated mutant forms of TH variants previously not studied (N = 23). We compared the in vitro solubility, thermal stability, and kinetic properties of the TH variants to determine the cause(s) of their impaired enzyme activity, and found great heterogeneity in all these properties among the mutated forms. Some TH variants had specific kinetic anomalies and phenylalanine hydroxylase, and Dopa oxidase activities were measured for variants that showed signs of altered substrate binding. p.Arg233His, p.Gly247Ser, and p.Phe375Leu had shifted substrate specificity from tyrosine to phenylalanine and Dopa, whereas p.Cys359Phe had an impaired activity toward these substrates. The new data about pathogenic mechanisms presented are expected to contribute to develop individualized therapy for THD patients.	0
Conversion of wild-type p53 core domain into a conformation that mimics a hot-spot mutant. || Binding Sites Chromatography, Gel DNA Primers Fluorescence Humans Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Models, Molecular Molecular Mimicry Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Plasmids Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Pressure Protein Conformation Protein Structure, Tertiary Temperature Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The wild-type p53 protein can be driven into a conformation corresponding to that adopted by structural mutant forms by heterodimerization with a mutant subunit. To seek partially folded states of the wild-type p53 core domain (p53C) we used high hydrostatic pressure (HP) and subzero temperatures. Aggregation of the protein was observed in parallel with its pressure denaturation at 25 and 37 degrees C. However, when HP experiments were performed at 4 degrees C, the extent of denaturation and aggregation was significantly less pronounced. On the other hand, subzero temperatures under pressure led to cold denaturation and yielded a non-aggregated, alternative conformation of p53C. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H15N-NMR) data showed that the alternative p53C conformation resembled that of the hot-spot oncogenic mutant R248Q. This alternative state was as susceptible to denaturation and aggregation as the mutant R248Q when subjected to HP at 25 degrees C. Together these data demonstrate that wild-type p53C adopts an alternative conformation with a mutant-like stability, consistent with the dominant-negative effect caused by many mutants. This alternative conformation is likely related to inactive forms that appear in vivo, usually driven by interaction with mutant proteins. Therefore, it can be a valuable target in the search for ways to interfere with protein misfolding and hence to prevent tumor development.	0
The novel c.247_249delTTC (p.F83del) GJB2 mutation in a family with prelingual sensorineural deafness. || Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness European Continental Ancestry Group Greece Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Mutation || Non-syndromic hearing loss is one of the most common hereditary determined diseases in human, and the disease is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Mutations in the GJB2 gene, encoding connexin 26 (Cx26), are a major cause of non-syndromic recessive hearing impairment in many countries and are largely dependent on ethnic groups. Due to the high frequency of the c.35delG GJB2 mutation in the Greek population, we have previously suggested that Greek patients with sensorineural, non-syndromic deafness should be tested for the c.35delG mutation and the coding region of the GJB2 gene should be sequenced in c.35delG heterozygotes. Here we present on the clinical and molecular genetic evaluation of a family suffering from prelingual, sensorineural, non-syndromic deafness. A novel c.247_249delTTC (p.F83del) GJB2 mutation was detected in compound heterozygosity with the c.35delG GJB2 mutation in the proband and was later confirmed in the father, while the mother was homozygous for the c.35delG GJB2 mutation. We conclude that compound heterozygosity of the novel c.247_249delTTC (p.F83del) and the c.35delG mutations in the GJB2 gene was the cause of deafness in the proband and his father.	4

Mutations in the genes encoding presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and amyloid precursor protein have been identified as the main genetic causes of familial AD. To date, more than 200 mutations have been described worldwide in PSEN1, which is highly homologous with PSEN2, while mutations in PSEN2 have been rarely reported. We performed a systematic review of studies describing the mutations identified in PSEN2. Most PSEN2 mutations were detected in European and in African populations. Only two were found in Korean populations. Interestingly, PSEN2 mutations appeared not only in AD patients but also in patients with other disorders, including frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, breast cancer, dilated cardiomyopathy, and Parkinson's disease with dementia. Here, we have summarized the PSEN2 mutations and the potential implications of these mutations in dementia-associated disorders.	4
p53 Specifically Binds Triplex DNA In Vitro and in Cells. || Binding Sites DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Nucleic Acid Conformation Nucleotide Motifs Plasmids Promoter Regions, Genetic Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid Sequence Deletion Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Triplex DNA is implicated in a wide range of biological activities, including regulation of gene expression and genomic instability leading to cancer. The tumor suppressor p53 is a central regulator of cell fate in response to different type of insults. Sequence and structure specific modes of DNA recognition are core attributes of the p53 protein. The focus of this work is the structure-specific binding of p53 to DNA containing triplex-forming sequences in vitro and in cells and the effect on p53-driven transcription. This is the first DNA binding study of full-length p53 and its deletion variants to both intermolecular and intramolecular T.A.T triplexes. We demonstrate that the interaction of p53 with intermolecular T.A.T triplex is comparable to the recognition of CTG-hairpin non-B DNA structure. Using deletion mutants we determined the C-terminal DNA binding domain of p53 to be crucial for triplex recognition. Furthermore, strong p53 recognition of intramolecular T.A.T triplexes (H-DNA), stabilized by negative superhelicity in plasmid DNA, was detected by competition and immunoprecipitation experiments, and visualized by AFM. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed p53 binding T.A.T forming sequence in vivo. Enhanced reporter transactivation by p53 on insertion of triplex forming sequence into plasmid with p53 consensus sequence was observed by luciferase reporter assays. In-silico scan of human regulatory regions for the simultaneous presence of both consensus sequence and T.A.T motifs identified a set of candidate p53 target genes and p53-dependent activation of several of them (ABCG5, ENOX1, INSR, MCC, NFAT5) was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Our results show that T.A.T triplex comprises a new class of p53 binding sites targeted by p53 in a DNA structure-dependent mode in vitro and in cells. The contribution of p53 DNA structure-dependent binding to the regulation of transcription is discussed.	0
Tumours with class 3 BRAF mutants are sensitive to the inhibition of activated RAS. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Enzyme Activation Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Humans Indoles MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Mice Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mutation NIH 3T3 Cells Neurofibromatosis 1 Oncogene Protein p21(ras) Protein Multimerization Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Pyridones Pyrimidinones Sulfonamides Vemurafenib Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Approximately 200 BRAF mutant alleles have been identified in human tumours. Activating BRAF mutants cause feedback inhibition of GTP-bound RAS, are RAS-independent and signal either as active monomers (class 1) or constitutively active dimers (class 2). Here we characterize a third class of BRAF mutants-those that have impaired kinase activity or are kinase-dead. These mutants are sensitive to ERK-mediated feedback and their activation of signalling is RAS-dependent. The mutants bind more tightly than wild-type BRAF to RAS-GTP, and their binding to and activation of wild-type CRAF is enhanced, leading to increased ERK signalling. The model suggests that dysregulation of signalling by these mutants in tumours requires coexistent mechanisms for maintaining RAS activation despite ERK-dependent feedback. Consistent with this hypothesis, melanomas with these class 3 BRAF mutations also harbour RAS mutations or NF1 deletions. By contrast, in lung and colorectal cancers with class 3 BRAF mutants, RAS is typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. These tumours are sensitive to the inhibition of RAS activation by inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases. We have thus defined three distinct functional classes of BRAF mutants in human tumours. The mutants activate ERK signalling by different mechanisms that dictate their sensitivity to therapeutic inhibitors of the pathway.	0
Organoid cultures recapitulate esophageal adenocarcinoma heterogeneity providing a model for clonality studies and precision therapeutics. || Adenocarcinoma Aged Aged, 80 and over Clonal Evolution DNA Copy Number Variations DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Esophageal Neoplasms Female Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Karyotyping Male Middle Aged Mutation Organoids Precision Medicine Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Sequence Analysis, RNA Transcriptome || Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) incidence is increasing while 5-year survival rates remain less than 15%. A lack of experimental models has hampered progress. We have generated clinically annotated EAC organoid cultures that recapitulate the morphology, genomic, and transcriptomic landscape of the primary tumor including point mutations, copy number alterations, and mutational signatures. Karyotyping of organoid cultures has confirmed polyclonality reflecting the clonal architecture of the primary tumor. Furthermore, subclones underwent clonal selection associated with driver gene status. Medium throughput drug sensitivity testing demonstrates the potential of targeting receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream mediators. EAC organoid cultures provide a pre-clinical tool for studies of clonal evolution and precision therapeutics.	4
Detection of rarely identified multiple mutations in MECP2 gene do not contribute to enhanced severity in Rett syndrome. || Female Humans Male Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2 Mutation Parents Rett Syndrome || The objective of our study was to characterize the influence of multiple mutations in the MECP2 gene in a cohort of individuals with Rett syndrome. Further analysis demonstrated that nearly all resulted from de novo in cis mutations, where the disease severity was indistinguishable from single mutations. Our methods involved enrolling participants in the RTT Natural History Study (NHS). After providing informed consent through their parents or principal caretakers, additional molecular assessments were performed in the participants and their parents to assess the presence and location of more than one mutation in each. Clinical severity was assessed at each visit in those participants in the NHS. Non-contiguous MECP2 gene variations were detected in 12 participants and contiguous mutations involving a deletion and insertion in three participants. Thirteen of 15 participants had mutations that were in cis; four (of 13) had three MECP2 mutations; two (of 15) had mutations that were both in cis and in trans (i.e., on different alleles). Clinical severity did not appear different from NHS participants with a single similar mutation. Mutations in cis were identified in most participants; two individuals had mutations both in cis and in trans. The presence of multiple mutations was not associated with greater severity. Nevertheless, multiple mutations will require greater thought in the future, if genetic assignment to drug treatment protocols is considered.	4
Pin1-Induced Proline Isomerization in Cytosolic p53 Mediates BAX Activation and Apoptosis. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Humans Kinetics NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase Peptidylprolyl Isomerase Proline Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Stereoisomerism Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 bcl-2-Associated X Protein || The cytosolic fraction of the tumor suppressor p53 activates the apoptotic effector protein BAX to trigger apoptosis. Here we report that p53 activates BAX through a mechanism different from that associated with activation by BH3 only proteins (BIM and BID). We observed that cis-trans isomerization of proline 47 (Pro47) within p53, an inherently rare molecular event, was required for BAX activation. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 enhanced p53-dependent BAX activation by catalyzing cis-trans interconversion of p53 Pro47. Our results reveal a signaling mechanism whereby proline cis-trans isomerization in one protein triggers conformational and functional changes in a downstream signaling partner. Activation of BAX through the concerted action of cytosolic p53 and Pin1 may integrate cell stress signals to induce a direct apoptotic response.	0
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum and familial hypercholesterolemia: a deleterious combination of cardiovascular risk factors. || Adolescent Adult Child Coronary Artery Disease Female Genetic Testing Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Middle Aged Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins Mutation, Missense Pedigree Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum Risk Management || Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE), an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in ABCC6 gene, is characterised by fragmentation of elastic fibres with involvement of the cardiovascular system. We investigated a 60-year-old female with angina pectoris found to have PXE, associated with elevated plasma LDL-C suspected to be due to autosomal-co-dominant hypercholesterolemia. ABCC6, LDLR, PCSK9 and exon 26 of APOB genes were re-sequenced. Cardiovascular involvement was assessed by coronary angiography, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and ultrasound examination. The patient was a compound heterozygous for two ABCC6 mutations (p.S317R and p.R1141X) and heterozygous for a novel LDLR mutation (p.R574H). She had severe coronary stenosis and calcification of the arteries of the lower limbs. Treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/60mg/day, maintained over a 4.5-year period, reduced of LDL-C and the myocardial ischemic area. In PXE patients LDL-lowering treatment might contribute to delay macrovascular complications.	4
Virtual screening using covalent docking to find activators for G245S mutant p53. || Computer Simulation Humans Models, Genetic Mutation Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53 is the most mutated gene in all cancers. The mutant protein also accumulates in cells. The high frequency of p53 mutations makes the protein a promising target for anti-cancer therapy. Only a few molecules have been found, using in vitro screening, to reactivate the mutant protein. APR-246 is currently the most successful mutant p53 activator, which reactivates the transcriptional activity of p53 by covalently binding to C124 of the protein. We have recently created in silico models of G245S-mp53 in its apo and DNA-bound forms. In this paper we further report on our in silico screening for potential activators of G245S-mp53. We filtered the ZINC15 database (13 million compounds) to only include drug-like molecules with moderate to standard reactivity. Our filtered database of 130,000 compounds was screened using the DOCKTITE protocol in the Molecular Operating Environment software. We performed covalent docking at C124 of G245S-mp53 to identify potential activators of the mutant protein. The docked compounds were ranked using a consensus scoring approach. We also used ADMET Predictor™ to predict pharmacokinetics and the possible toxicities of the compounds. Our screening procedure has identified compounds, mostly thiosemicarbazones and halo-carbonyls, with the best potential as G245S-mp53 activators, which are described in this work. Based on its binding scores and ADMET risk score, compound 2 is likely to have the best potential as a G245S-mp53 activator compared to the other top hits.	0
RAS and downstream RAF-MEK and PI3K-AKT signaling in neuronal development, function and dysfunction. || Animals Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Humans Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Nerve Regeneration Neurons Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction raf Kinases ras Proteins || In postmitotic neurons, the activation of RAS family small GTPases regulates survival, growth and differentiation. Dysregulation of RAS or its major effector pathway, the cascade of RAF-, mitogen-activated and extracellular-signal regulated kinase kinases (MEK), and extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK) causes the RASopathies, a group of neurodevelopmental disorders whose pathogenic mechanisms are the subject of intense research. I here summarize the functions of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in neurons in vivo, and discuss perspectives for harnessing this pathway to enable novel treatments for nervous system injury, the RASopathies, and possibly other neurological conditions.	0
The Oncogenic Role of Tribbles 1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Is Mediated by a Feedback Loop Involving microRNA-23a and p53. ||  || Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy associated with a high risk of recurrence and metastasis and a poor prognosis. Here, we examined the involvement of the pseudokinase Tribbles 1 (TRIB1), a scaffold protein associated with several malignancies, in HCC and investigated the underlying mechanisms. TRIB1 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines in correlation with low levels of p53. TRIB1 gain and loss of function experiments indicated that TRIB1 promoted HCC cell viability concomitant with the downregulation of p53, and induced HCC cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. TRIB1 was identified as a target of microRNA-23a (miR-23a), and miR-23a overexpression downregulated TRIB1 and upregulated p53 in HCC cells. Ectopic expression of TRIB1 upregulated β-catenin and its effectors c-myc and MMP-7 in a p53-dependent manner. TRIB1 silencing inhibited tumor growth and promoted apoptosis in vivo via a mechanism that would involve the modulation of p53 and β-catenin signaling. The present results indicate that TRIB1 promotes HCC tumorigenesis and invasiveness via a feedback loop that involves the modulation of its expression by miR-23a with the likely downregulation of p53, and suggest the involvement of the β-catenin signaling pathway. These findings suggest potential targets for the treatment of HCC and therefore merit further investigation.	0
Germline TP53 Mutation and Clinical Characteristics of Korean Patients With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. || Adolescent Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool Codon Female Frameshift Mutation Germ-Line Mutation Humans Infant Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Male Middle Aged Neoplasms, Multiple Primary Polymorphism, Genetic Republic of Korea Retrospective Studies Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Little is known of the mutation and tumor spectrum of Korean patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Owing to the rarity of LFS, few cases have been reported in Korea thus far. This study aimed to retrospectively review the mutations and clinical characteristics of Korean patients with LFS. TP53 mutation was screened in 89 unrelated individuals at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea, from 2004 to 2015. Six additional mutation carriers were obtained from the literature. We identified nine different mutations in 14 Korean patients (male to female ratio=0.3:1). Two such frameshift mutations (p.Pro98Leufs*25, p.Pro27Leufs*17) were novel. The recurrent mutations were located at codons 31 (n=2; p.Val31Ile), 175 (n=3; p.Arg175His), and 273 (n=4; p.Arg273His and p.Arg273Cys). The median age at the first tumor onset was 25 yr. Ten patients (71%) developed multiple primary tumors. A diverse spectrum of tumors was observed, including breast (n=6), osteosarcoma (n=4), brain (n=4), leukemia (n=2), stomach (n=2), thyroid (n=2), lung (n=2), skin (n=2), bladder (n=1), nasal cavity cancer (n=1), and adrenocortical carcinoma (n=1). There was considerable heterogeneity in the TP53 mutations and tumor spectrum in Korean patients with LFS. Our results suggest shared and different LFS characteristics between Caucasian and Korean patients. This is the first report on the mutation spectrum and clinical characteristics from the largest series of Korean LFS patients.	4
The p.V37I exclusive genotype of GJB2: a genetic risk-indicator of postnatal permanent childhood hearing impairment. || Child Connexin 26 Connexins Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Infant, Newborn || Postnatal permanent childhood hearing impairment (PCHI) is frequent (0.25%-0.99%) and difficult to detect in the early stage, which may impede the speech, language and cognitive development of affected children. Genetic tests of common variants associated with postnatal PCHI in newborns may provide an efficient way to identify those at risk. In this study, we detected a strong association of the p.V37I exclusive genotype of GJB2 with postnatal PCHI in Chinese Hans (P = 1.4×10(-10); OR 62.92, 95% CI 21.27-186.12). This common genotype in Eastern Asians was present in a substantial percentage (20%) of postnatal PCHI subjects, and its prevalence was significantly increased in normal-hearing newborns who failed at least one newborn hearing screen. Our results indicated that the p.V37I exclusive genotype of GJB2 may cause subclinical hearing impairment at birth and increases risk for postnatal PCHI. Genetic testing of GJB2 in East Asian newborns will facilitate prompt detection and intervention of postnatal PCHI.	4
Distinct profile of driver mutations and clinical features in immunomarker-defined subsets of pulmonary large-cell carcinoma. || Adenocarcinoma Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Female Genotype Humans Immunohistochemistry In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Kaplan-Meier Estimate Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation || Pulmonary large-cell carcinoma-a diagnostically and clinically controversial entity-is defined as a non-small-cell carcinoma lacking morphologic differentiation of either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, but suspected to represent an end stage of poor differentiation of these tumor types. Given the recent advances in immunohistochemistry to distinguish adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and the recent insights that several therapeutically relevant genetic alterations are distributed differentially in these tumors, we hypothesized that immunophenotyping may stratify large-cell carcinomas into subsets with distinct profiles of targetable driver mutations. We therefore analyzed 102 large-cell carcinomas by immunohistochemistry for TTF-1 and ΔNp63/p40 as classifiers for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, and correlated the resulting subtypes with nine therapeutically relevant genetic alterations characteristic of adenocarcinoma (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/MEK1, NRAS, ERBB2/HER2 mutations and ALK rearrangements) or more common in squamous cell carcinoma (PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations). The immunomarkers classified large-cell carcinomas as variants of adenocarcinoma (n=62; 60%), squamous cell carcinoma (n=20; 20%) or marker-null (n=20; 20%). Genetic alterations were found in 38 cases (37%), including EGFR (n=1), KRAS (n=30), BRAF (n=2), MAP2K1 (n=1), ALK (n=3) and PIK3CA (n=1). All molecular alterations characteristic of adenocarcinoma occurred in tumors with immunoprofiles of adenocarcinoma or marker-null, but not in tumors with squamous immunoprofiles (combined mutation rate 50% vs 30% vs 0%, respectively; P<0.001), whereas the sole PIK3CA mutation occurred in a tumor with squamous profile (5%). Furthermore, marker-null large-cell carcinomas were associated with significantly inferior disease-free (P<0.001) and overall (P=0.001) survival. In conclusion, the majority (80%) of large-cell carcinomas can be classified by immunomarkers as variants of adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, which stratifies these tumors into subsets with a distinct distribution of driver mutations and distinct prognoses. These findings have practical implications for diagnosis, predictive molecular testing and therapy selection.	4
Predicting positive p53 cancer rescue regions using Most Informative Positive (MIP) active learning. || Algorithms Artificial Intelligence Computational Biology Computer Simulation DNA Mutational Analysis Fungal Proteins Humans Models, Genetic Models, Molecular Mutation Protein Engineering Reproducibility of Results Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Yeasts || Many protein engineering problems involve finding mutations that produce proteins with a particular function. Computational active learning is an attractive approach to discover desired biological activities. Traditional active learning techniques have been optimized to iteratively improve classifier accuracy, not to quickly discover biologically significant results. We report here a novel active learning technique, Most Informative Positive (MIP), which is tailored to biological problems because it seeks novel and informative positive results. MIP active learning differs from traditional active learning methods in two ways: (1) it preferentially seeks Positive (functionally active) examples; and (2) it may be effectively extended to select gene regions suitable for high throughput combinatorial mutagenesis. We applied MIP to discover mutations in the tumor suppressor protein p53 that reactivate mutated p53 found in human cancers. This is an important biomedical goal because p53 mutants have been implicated in half of all human cancers, and restoring active p53 in tumors leads to tumor regression. MIP found Positive (cancer rescue) p53 mutants in silico using 33% fewer experiments than traditional non-MIP active learning, with only a minor decrease in classifier accuracy. Applying MIP to in vivo experimentation yielded immediate Positive results. Ten different p53 mutations found in human cancers were paired in silico with all possible single amino acid rescue mutations, from which MIP was used to select a Positive Region predicted to be enriched for p53 cancer rescue mutants. In vivo assays showed that the predicted Positive Region: (1) had significantly more (p<0.01) new strong cancer rescue mutants than control regions (Negative, and non-MIP active learning); (2) had slightly more new strong cancer rescue mutants than an Expert region selected for purely biological considerations; and (3) rescued for the first time the previously unrescuable p53 cancer mutant P152L.	0
NOXA-induced alterations in the Bax/Smac axis enhance sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mice Mice, Nude Mitochondrial Proteins Neoplasm Transplantation Ovarian Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Transplantation, Heterologous Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays bcl-2-Associated X Protein || Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death from gynecologic malignancy. Deregulation of p53 and/or p73-associated apoptotic pathways contribute to the platinum-based resistance in ovarian cancer. NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, is identified as a transcription target of p53 and/or p73. In this study, we found that genetic variants of Bcl-2 proteins exist among cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cells, and the responses of NOXA and Bax to cisplatin are regulated mainly by p53. We further evaluated the effect of NOXA on cisplatin. NOXA induced apoptosis and sensitized A2780s and SKOV3 cells to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. The effects were mediated by elevated Bax expression, enhanced caspase activation, release of Cyt C and Smac into the cytosol. Furthermore, gene silencing of Bax or Smac significantly attenuated NOXA and/or cisplatin-induced apoptosis in chemosensitive A2780s cells, whereas overexpression of Bax or addition of Smac-N7 peptide significantly increased NOXA and/or cisplatin-induced apoptosis in chemoresistant SKOV3 cells. To our knowledge, these data suggest a new mechanism by which NOXA chemosensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin by inducing alterations in the Bax/Smac axis. Taken together, our findings show that NOXA is potentially useful as a chemosensitizer in ovarian cancer therapy.	0
Putative tumour suppressor gene necdin is hypermethylated and mutated in human cancer. || Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cells, Cultured DNA Methylation Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Immunoblotting Immunoenzyme Techniques Mutation Neoplasms Nerve Tissue Proteins Nuclear Proteins Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA, Messenger Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Urothelium || Necdin (NDN) expression is downregulated in telomerase-immortalised normal human urothelial cells. Telomerase-immortalised normal human urothelial cells have no detected genetic alterations. Accordingly, many of the genes whose expression is altered following immortalisation are those for which epigenetic silencing is reported. NDN expression was examined in normal tissues and tumour cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry was performed on urothelial carcinoma (UC). Urothelial carcinoma and UC cell lines were subject to HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Array-based methylation analyses. Mutation screening was performed. The functional significance of NDN expression was investigated using retroviral-mediated downregulation or overexpression. NDN protein was widely expressed in normal tissues. Loss of expression was observed in 38 out of 44 (86%) of UC cell lines and 19 out of 25 (76%) of non-UC cell lines. Loss of NDN protein was found in the majority of primary UC. Oncomine analysis demonstrated downregulation of expression in multiple tumour types. In UC, tumour-specific hypermethylation of NDN and key CpG sites where hypermethylation correlated with reduced expression were identified. Six novel mutations, including some of predicted functional significance, were identified in colorectal and ovarian cancer cell lines. Functional studies showed that NDN could suppress colony formation at low cell density and affect anchorage-independent growth and anoikis in vitro. NDN is a novel tumour suppressor candidate that is downregulated and hypermethylated or mutated in cancer.	0
C-RAF mutations confer resistance to RAF inhibitors. || Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Immunoprecipitation Melanoma Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf || Melanomas that contain B-RAF(V600E) mutations respond transiently to RAF and MEK inhibitors; however, resistance to these agents remains a formidable challenge. Although B- or C-RAF dysregulation represents prominent resistance mechanisms, resistance-associated point mutations in RAF oncoproteins are surprisingly rare. To gain insights herein, we conducted random mutagenesis screens to identify B- or C-RAF mutations that confer resistance to RAF inhibitors. Whereas bona fide B-RAF(V600E) resistance alleles were rarely observed, we identified multiple C-RAF mutations that produced biochemical and pharmacologic resistance. Potent C-RAF resistance alleles localized to a 14-3-3 consensus binding site or a separate site within the P loop. These mutations elicited paradoxical upregulation of RAF kinase activity in a dimerization-dependent manner following exposure to RAF inhibitors. Knowledge of resistance-associated C-RAF mutations may enhance biochemical understanding of RAF-dependent signaling, anticipate clinical resistance to novel RAF inhibitors, and guide the design of "next-generation" inhibitors for deployment in RAF- or RAS-driven malignancies.	0
Mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene and overexpression of its protein in 62 Japanese non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Child Exons Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Immunohistochemistry Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin Male Middle Aged Mutation Ribonucleases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || To clarify whether p53 mutation could be involved in the pathogenesis of various subtypes of lymphoma, we investigated 62 Japanese cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) for p53 gene mutations and their relationship with the expression of p53 protein. Mutations in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were screened for using the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA) and confirmed by direct sequencing, followed by immunohistochemical analysis for p53 protein. Missense and/or nonsense mutations of p53 were detected in 3 (10.7%) of 28 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBLs) and 2 (15.4%) of 13 T-cell NHLs (15.4%). A single missense mutation at codon 157 (Val to Phe) in exon 5 and at codon 273 (Arg to Pro) in exon 8 was found respectively in 2 DLBLs and in one peripheral T-cell lymphoma (unspecified). In these 3 cases harbouring a missense mutation, overexpression of p53 protein was observed in more than 80% of tumour cells. Double transversion mutations comprising of a missense mutation at codon 167 (Gln to His) in exon 5 and a nonsense mutation at codon 183 (Ser to stop codon) in exon 5 were detected in one DLBL that had apparently transformed from follicular lymphoma and in one advanced adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL). In these two cases harbouring p53 nonsense mutation, no cells positive for p53 protein immunostaining were detected, as well as lymphomas without p53 mutation.	4
Analysis of GJB2 mutations and the clinical manifestation in a large Hungarian cohort. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexins Female Gene Frequency Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Hungary Male Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Sequence Analysis, DNA Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || Pathogenic variants of the gap junction beta 2 (GJB2) gene are responsible for about 50% of hereditary non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL). In this study, we report mutation frequency and phenotype comparison of different GJB2 gene alterations in Hungarian NSHL patients. The total coding region of the GJB2 gene was analyzed with Sanger or NGS sequencing for 239 patients with NSHL and 160 controls. Homozygous and compound heterozygous GJB2 mutations were associated with early onset serious clinical phenotype in 28 patients. In 24 patients, two deletion or nonsense mutations were detected in individuals with mainly prelingual NSHL. In compound heterozygous cases, a combination of deletion and missense mutations associated with milder postlingual NSHL. A further 25 cases harbored single heterozygous GJB2 mutations mainly associated with later onset, milder clinical phenotype. The most common mutation was the c.35delG deletion, with 12.6% allele frequency. The hearing loss was more severe in the prelingual groups. The mutation frequency of GJB2 in the investigated cohort is lower than in other European cohorts. The most serious cases were associated with homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations. In our cohort the hearing impairment and age of onset was not altered between in cases with only one heterozygous GJB2 mutation and wild type genotype, which may exclude the possibility of autosomal dominant inheritance. In early onset, severe to profound hearing loss cases, if the GJB2 analysis results in only one heterozygous alteration further next generation sequencing is highly recommended.	4
Constitutive Activation of DNA Damage Checkpoint Signaling Contributes to Mutant p53 Accumulation via Modulation of p53 Ubiquitination. || Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins Cell Line, Tumor DNA Damage Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, cdc Half-Life Humans Lung Neoplasms Mutation Phosphorylation Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Serine Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitination || Many mutant p53 proteins exhibit an abnormally long half-life and overall increased abundance compared with wild-type p53 in tumors, contributing to mutant p53's gain-of-function oncogenic properties. Here, a novel mechanism is revealed for the maintenance of mutant p53 abundance in cancer that is dependent on DNA damage checkpoint activation. High-level mutant p53 expression in lung cancer cells was associated with preferential p53 monoubiquitination versus polyubiquitination, suggesting a role for the ubiquitin/proteasome system in regulation of mutant p53 abundance in cancer cells. Interestingly, mutant p53 ubiquitination status was regulated by ataxia-telangectasia mutated (ATM) activation and downstream phosphorylation of mutant p53 (serine 15), both in resting and in genotoxin-treated lung cancer cells. Specifically, either inhibition of ATM with caffeine or mutation of p53 (serine 15 to alanine) restored MDM2-dependent polyubiquitination of otherwise monoubiquitinated mutant p53. Caffeine treatment rescued MDM2-dependent proteasome degradation of mutant p53 in cells exhibiting active DNA damage signaling, and ATM knockdown phenocopied the caffeine effect. Importantly, in cells analyzed individually by flow cytometry, p53 levels were highest in cells exhibiting the greatest levels of DNA damage response, and interference with DNA damage signaling preferentially decreased the relative percentage of cells in a population with the highest levels of mutant p53. These data demonstrate that active DNA damage signaling contributes to high levels of mutant p53 via modulation of ubiquitin/proteasome activity toward p53. The ability of DNA damage checkpoint signaling to mediate accumulation of mutant p53 suggests that targeting this signaling pathway may provide therapeutic gain.

Sex related expressivity of the phenotype in coronal craniosynostosis caused by the recurrent P250R FGFR3 mutation. || Craniosynostoses Female Gene Expression Humans Male Pedigree Phenotype Point Mutation Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Radiography Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor Skull || A recurrent point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that converts proline 250 into arginine is commonly associated with coronal craniosynostosis and has allowed definition of a new syndrome on a molecular basis. Sixty-two patients with sporadic or familial forms of coronal craniosynostosis were investigated for the P250R FGFR3 mutation. It was identified in 20 probands originating from 27 unrelated families (74%), while only 6/35 sporadic cases (17%) harboured the mutation. In both familial and sporadic cases, females were significantly more severely affected than males. Hence, while 68% of females carrying the P250R mutation showed brachycephaly, only 35% of males had the same phenotype. In the most severe forms of the disease, the association of bicoronal craniosynostosis with hypertelorism and marked bulging of the temporal fossae were common hallmarks that might be helpful for clinical diagnosis. Taken together, these results indicate that the P250R FGFR3 mutation is mostly familial and is associated with a more severe phenotype in females than in males. The sex related severity of the condition points to the possible implication of modifier genes in this syndrome.	4
Reactivating p53 and Inducing Tumor Apoptosis (RITA) Enhances the Response of RITA-Sensitive Colorectal Cancer Cells to Chemotherapeutic Agents 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Damage Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Fluorouracil Gene Expression Humans Mutation Organoplatinum Compounds Oxaliplatin Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the most common cancer of the gastrointestinal tract with frequently dysregulated intracellular signaling pathways, including p53 signaling. The mainstay of chemotherapy treatment of CRC is 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin. The two anticancer drugs mediate their therapeutic effect via DNA damage-triggered signaling. The small molecule reactivating p53 and inducing tumor apoptosis (RITA) is described as an activator of wild-type and reactivator of mutant p53 function, resulting in elevated levels of p53 protein, cell growth arrest, and cell death. Additionally, it has been shown that RITA can induce DNA damage signaling. It is expected that the therapeutic benefits of 5FU and oxaliplatin can be increased by enhancing DNA damage signaling pathways. Therefore, we highlighted the antiproliferative response of RITA alone and in combination with 5FU or oxaliplatin in human CRC cells. A panel of long-term established CRC cell lines (n=9) including p53 wild-type, p53 mutant, and p53 null and primary patient-derived, low-passage cell lines (n=5) with different p53 protein status were used for this study. A substantial number of CRC cells with pronounced sensitivity to RITA (IC50<3.0 μmol/l) were identified within established (4/9) and primary patient-derived (2/5) CRC cell lines harboring wild-type or mutant p53 protein. Sensitivity to RITA appeared independent of p53 status and was associated with an increase in antiproliferative response to 5FU and oxaliplatin, a transcriptional increase of p53 targets p21 and NOXA, and a decrease in MYC mRNA. The effect of RITA as an inducer of DNA damage was shown by a strong elevation of phosphorylated histone variant H2A.X, which was restricted to RITA-sensitive cells. Our data underline the primary effect of RITA, inducing DNA damage, and demonstrate the differential antiproliferative effect of RITA to CRC cells independent of p53 protein status. We found a substantial number of RITA-sensitive CRC cells within both panels of established CRC cell lines and primary patient-derived CRC cell lines (6/14) that provide a rationale for combining RITA with 5FU or oxaliplatin to enhance the antiproliferative response to both chemotherapeutic agents.	0

Huvariome: a web server resource of whole genome next-generation sequencing allelic frequencies to aid in pathological candidate gene selection. ||  || Next generation sequencing provides clinical research scientists with direct read out of innumerable variants, including personal, pathological and common benign variants. The aim of resequencing studies is to determine the candidate pathogenic variants from individual genomes, or from family-based or tumor/normal genome comparisons. Whilst the use of appropriate controls within the experimental design will minimize the number of false positive variations selected, this number can be reduced further with the use of high quality whole genome reference data to minimize false positives variants prior to candidate gene selection. In addition the use of platform related sequencing error models can help in the recovery of ambiguous genotypes from lower coverage data. We have developed a whole genome database of human genetic variations, Huvariome, determined by whole genome deep sequencing data with high coverage and low error rates. The database was designed to be sequencing technology independent but is currently populated with 165 individual whole genomes consisting of small pedigrees and matched tumor/normal samples sequenced with the Complete Genomics sequencing platform. Common variants have been determined for a Benelux population cohort and represented as genotypes alongside the results of two sets of control data (73 of the 165 genomes), Huvariome Core which comprises 31 healthy individuals from the Benelux region, and Diversity Panel consisting of 46 healthy individuals representing 10 different populations and 21 samples in three Pedigrees. Users can query the database by gene or position via a web interface and the results are displayed as the frequency of the variations as detected in the datasets. We demonstrate that Huvariome can provide accurate reference allele frequencies to disambiguate sequencing inconsistencies produced in resequencing experiments. Huvariome has been used to support the selection of candidate cardiomyopathy related genes which have a homozygous genotype in the reference cohorts. This database allows the users to see which selected variants are common variants (> 5% minor allele frequency) in the Huvariome core samples, thus aiding in the selection of potentially pathogenic variants by filtering out common variants that are not listed in one of the other public genomic variation databases. The no-call rate and the accuracy of allele calling in Huvariome provides the user with the possibility of identifying platform dependent errors associated with specific regions of the human genome. Huvariome is a simple to use resource for validation of resequencing results obtained by NGS experiments. The high sequence coverage and low error rates provide scientists with the ability to remove false positive results from pedigree studies. Results are returned via a web interface that displays location-based genetic variation frequency, impact on protein function, association with known genetic variations and a quality score of the variation base derived from Huvariome Core and the Diversity Panel data. These results may be used to identify and prioritize rare variants that, for example, might be disease relevant. In testing the accuracy of the Huvariome database, alleles of a selection of ambiguously called coding single nucleotide variants were successfully predicted in all cases. Data protection of individuals is ensured by restricted access to patient derived genomes from the host institution which is relevant for future molecular diagnostics.	4
Late-onset Pompe disease: what is the prevalence of limb-girdle muscular weakness presentation? || Adult Biopsy Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle Prevalence alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is an inherited disease caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency. A single center observational study aimed at assessing the prevalence of late-onset Pompe disease in a high-risk Brazilian population, using the dried blood spot test to detect GAA deficiency as a main screening tool. Dried blood spots were collected for GAA activity assay from 24 patients with "unexplained" limb-girdle muscular weakness without vacuolar myopathy in their muscle biopsy. Samples with reduced enzyme activity were also investigated for GAA gene mutations. Of the 24 patients with dried blood spots, one patient (4.2%) showed low GAA enzyme activity (NaG/AaGIA: 40.42; %INH: 87.22%). In this patient, genetic analysis confirmed two heterozygous mutations in the GAA gene (c.-32-13T>G/p.Arg854Ter). Our data confirm that clinicians should look for late-onset Pompe disease in patients whose clinical manifestation is an "unexplained" limb-girdle weakness even without vacuolar myopathy in muscle biopsy.	1
Genetic Testing of Non-familial Deaf Patients for CIB2 and GJB2 Mutations: Phenotype and Genetic Counselling. || Calcium-Binding Proteins Connexins Deafness Female Genetic Counseling Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Testing Humans Male Mutation Pakistan Phenotype || CIB2 and GJB2 genes variants contribute significantly in familial cases of prelingual recessive hearing loss (HL). This study was aimed to determine the CIB2 and GJB2 variants and associated phenotype in 150 non-familial individuals with HL. After getting informed consent, 150 non-familial deaf patients were enrolled and blood samples were obtained for DNA extraction. Pure tone air conduction audiometry was performed. Coding exons of CIB2 and GJB2 genes were Sanger sequenced. A tetra primer ARMS assay was developed for recurrent CIB2 variant. Four bi-allelic GJB2 variants, c.71G>A p.(Trp24*), c.231G>A p.(Trp77*), c.235delC p.(Leu79Cysfs3*) and c.35delG p.(Gly11Leufs24*), were found in nine hearing impaired individuals. We also found four homozygotes and five carriers of c.380G>A p. (Arg127His) variant of controversial clinical significance. CIB2 sequencing revealed single recurrent variant c.272T>C p. (Phe91Ser) segregating with HL in ten individuals. Among our patients, c.71G>A (p.Trp24*) was the most common variant, accounted for 45% of GJB2 variants. Two known GJB2 variants, c.235delC p. (Leu79Cysfs3*) and c.310del14 p. (Lys105Argfs2*), are reported here for the first time in Pakistani population. Our data further support the benign nature of c.380G>A p. (Arg127His) variant. For CIB2, c.272T>C p. (Phe91Ser) is the second common cause of HL among our sporadic cases. Phenotypically, in our patients, individuals homozygous for GJB2 variants had profound HL, whereas CIB2 homozygotes had severe to profound prelingual HL. Our results suggest that GJB2 and CIB2 are common cause of HL in different Pakistani ethnicities.	4
Role of p53 in Cell Death and Human Cancers. ||  || p53 is a nuclear transcription factor with a pro-apoptotic function. Since over 50% of human cancers carry loss of function mutations in p53 gene, p53 has been considered to be one of the classical type tumor suppressors. Mutant p53 acts as the dominant-negative inhibitor toward wild-type p53. Indeed, mutant p53 has an oncogenic potential. In some cases, malignant cancer cells bearing p53 mutations display a chemo-resistant phenotype. In response to a variety of cellular stresses such as DNA damage, p53 is induced to accumulate in cell nucleus to exert its pro-apoptotic function. Activated p53 promotes cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair and/or apoptosis to prevent the propagation of cells with serious DNA damage through the transactivation of its target genes implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Thus, the DNA-binding activity of p53 is tightly linked to its tumor suppressive function. In the present review article, we describe the regulatory mechanisms of p53 and also p53-mediated therapeutic strategies to cure malignant cancers.	0
GJB2 and mitochondrial A1555G gene mutations in nonsyndromic profound hearing loss and carrier frequencies in healthy individuals. || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genes, Mitochondrial Heterozygote Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation || This study aimed to assess mutations in GJB2 gene (connexin 26), as well as A1555G mitochondrial mutation in both the patients with profound genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss and healthy controls. Ninety-five patients with profound hearing loss (>90 dB) and 67 healthy controls were included. All patients had genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss. Molecular analyses were performed for connexin 26 (35delG, M34T, L90P, R184P, delE120, 167delT, 235delC and IVS1+1 A-->G) mutations, and for mitochondrial A1555G mutation. Twenty-two connexin 26 mutations were found in 14.7% of the patients, which were 35delG, R184P, del120E and IVS1+1 A-->G. Mitochondrial A1555G mutation was not encountered. The most common GJB2 gene mutation was 35delG, which was followed by del120E, IVS1+1 A-->G and R184P, and 14.3% of the patients segregated with DFNB1. In consanguineous marriages, the most common mutation was 35delG. The carrier frequency for 35delG mutation was 1.4% in the controls. 35delG and del120E populations, seems the most common connexin 26 mutations that cause genetic nonsyndromic hearing loss in this country. Nonsyndromic hearing loss mostly shows DFNB1 form of segregation.	4
A next-generation sequencing gene panel (MiamiOtoGenes) for comprehensive analysis of deafness genes. || Computational Biology Databases, Genetic Deafness Exons Genetic Association Studies Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Hearing Heredity High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Pedigree Phenotype Reproducibility of Results Untranslated Regions || Extreme genetic heterogeneity along with remarkable variation in the distribution of causative variants across in different ethnicities makes single gene testing inefficient for hearing loss. We developed a custom capture/next-generation sequencing gene panel of 146 known deafness genes with a total target size of approximately 1 MB. The genes were identified by searching databases including Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage, the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and most recent peer-reviewed publications related to the genetics of deafness. The design covered all coding exons, UTRs and 25 bases of intronic flanking sequences for each exon. To validate our panel, we used 6 positive controls with variants in known deafness genes and 8 unsolved samples from individuals with hearing loss. Mean coverage of the targeted exons was 697X. On average, each sample had 99.8%, 96.2% and 92.7% of the targeted region coverage of 1X, 50X and 100X reads, respectively. Analysis detected all known variants in nuclear genes. These results prove the accuracy and reliability of the custom capture experiment.	4
Analysis of p.V37I compound heterozygous mutations in the GJB2 gene in Chinese infants and young children. || Child, Preschool China Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Carrier Screening Hearing Loss Hearing Tests Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male || The p.V37I (c.109G>A) mutation in the GJB2 gene is the common frequent cause of congenital deafness; however, its pathogenicity is debated. The present study investigated the prevalence of p.V37I in Chinese infants and young children and associated clinical characteristics. The subjects of the present study were screened for mutations in GJB2 (235delC, 299delAT, 176dell6, 35delG), SLC26A4 (IVS7-2A>G, 2168A>G), GJB3 (538C>T), and in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene (1555A>G, 1494C>T). Subjects with p.V37I underwent an audiological evaluation. GJB2 exon sequencing revealed that 20 subjects had p.V37I compound heterozygous mutations, one of whom had a family history; the mutations included c.235delC/p.V37I (n = 12), c.299AT/p.V37I (n = 7), and c.176del16/p.V37I (n = 1). Of the 20 subjects, 12 were referred for Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS). Nine of the 20 subjects had mild hearing loss in the better ear and 5 had moderate hearing loss in the better ear while 4 had normal hearing. Among subjects with the c.235delC/p.V37I mutation, 5 had mild hearing loss and 2 had moderate hearing loss while 3 had normal hearing. Among subjects with the c.299AT/p.V37I mutation, 3 had mld hearing loss and 3 had moderate hearing loss while 1 had normal hearing. One subject with the c.176del16/p.V37I mutation had mild hearing loss. Few studies have reported on the clinical characteristics of Chinese infants with p.V37I compound heterozygous mutations identified via screening for deafness genes and GJB2 sequencing. The c.235delC/p.V37I mutation was the most prevalent mutation found in subjects. The degree of hearing loss associated with p.V37I compound heterozygous mutations was mainly mild to moderate.	4
Molecular profiling of low grade serous ovarian tumours identifies novel candidate driver genes. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous Exome Female Follow-Up Studies Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Variation Humans Middle Aged Neoplasm Grading Ovarian Neoplasms Prognosis RNA, Messenger Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Young Adult || Low grade serous ovarian tumours are a rare and under-characterised histological subtype of epithelial ovarian tumours, with little known of the molecular drivers and facilitators of tumorigenesis beyond classic oncogenic RAS/RAF mutations. With a move towards targeted therapies due to the chemoresistant nature of this subtype, it is pertinent to more fully characterise the genetic events driving this tumour type, some of which may influence response to therapy and/or development of drug resistance. We performed genome-wide high-resolution genomic copy number analysis (Affymetrix SNP6.0) and mutation hotspot screening (KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, ERBB2 and TP53) to compare a large cohort of ovarian serous borderline tumours (SBTs, n = 57) with low grade serous carcinomas (LGSCs, n = 19). Whole exome sequencing was performed for 13 SBTs, nine LGSCs and one mixed low/high grade carcinoma. Copy number aberrations were detected in 61% (35/57) of SBTs, compared to 100% (19/19) of LGSCs. Oncogenic RAS/RAF/ERBB2 mutations were detected in 82.5% (47/57) of SBTs compared to 63% (12/19) of LGSCs, with NRAS mutations detected only in LGSC. Some copy number aberrations appeared to be enriched in LGSC, most significantly loss of 9p and homozygous deletions of the CDKN2A/2B locus. Exome sequencing identified BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, USP9X and EIF1AX as the most frequently mutated genes. We have identified markers of progression from borderline to LGSC and novel drivers of LGSC. USP9X and EIF1AX have both been linked to regulation of mTOR, suggesting that mTOR inhibitors may be a key companion treatment for targeted therapy trials of MEK and RAF inhibitors.	4
Impact of low-frequency hotspot mutation R282Q on the structure of p53 DNA-binding domain as revealed by crystallography at 1.54 angstroms resolution. || Amino Acid Substitution Crystallography, X-Ray Humans Models, Molecular Mutation Protein Structure, Secondary Protein Structure, Tertiary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor suppressor p53 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and its central DNA-binding domain (DBD) harbors six hotspots (Arg175, Gly245, Arg248, Arg249, Arg273 and Arg282) for human cancers. Here, the crystal structure of a low-frequency hotspot mutant, p53DBD(R282Q), is reported at 1.54 angstroms resolution together with the results of molecular-dynamics simulations on the basis of the structure. In addition to eliminating a salt bridge, the R282Q mutation has a significant impact on the properties of two DNA-binding loops (L1 and L3). The L1 loop is flexible in the wild type, but it is not flexible in the mutant. The L3 loop of the wild type is not flexible, whereas it assumes two conformations in the mutant. Molecular-dynamics simulations indicated that both conformations of the L3 loop are accessible under biological conditions. It is predicted that the elimination of the salt bridge and the inversion of the flexibility of L1 and L3 are directly or indirectly responsible for deactivating the tumor suppressor p53.	0
Characterization of phenylketonuria missense substitutions, distant from the phenylalanine hydroxylase active site, illustrates a paradigm for mechanism and potential modulation of phenotype. || ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters Amino Acid Substitution Carrier Proteins Catalytic Domain Cell Line Chromatography, Affinity Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel Escherichia coli Escherichia coli Proteins Humans Maltose-Binding Proteins Monosaccharide Transport Proteins Mutation, Missense Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Protein Biosynthesis Protein Conformation Recombinant Fusion Proteins Transcription, Genetic || Missense mutations account for 48% of all reported human disease-causing alleles. Since few are predicted to ablate directly an enzyme's catalytic site or other functionally important amino acid residues, how do most missense mutations cause loss of function and lead to disease? The classic monogenic phenotype hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), manifesting notably as phenylketonuria (PKU), where missense mutations in the PAH gene compose 60% of the alleles impairing phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) function, allows us to examine this question. Here we characterize four PKU-associated PAH mutations (F39L, K42I, L48S, I65T), each changing an amino acid distant from the enzyme active site. Using three complementary in vitro protein expression systems, and 3D-structural localization, we demonstrate a common mechanism. PAH protein folding is affected, causing altered oligomerization and accelerated proteolytic degradation, leading to reduced cellular levels of this cytosolic protein. Enzyme specific activity and kinetic properties are not adversely affected, implying that the only way these mutations reduce enzyme activity within cells in vivo is by producing structural changes which provoke the cell to destroy the aberrant protein. The F39L, L48S, and I65T PAH mutations were selected because each is associated with a spectrum of in vivo HPA among patients. Our in vitro data suggest that interindividual differences in cellular handling of the mutant, but active, PAH proteins will contribute to the observed variability of phenotypic severity. PKU thus supports a newly emerging paradigm both for mechanism whereby missense mutations cause genetic disease and for potential modulation of a disease phenotype.	0
CNS germinomas are characterized by global demethylation, chromosomal instability and mutational activation of the Kit-, Ras/Raf/Erk- and Akt-pathways. || Adolescent Adult Base Sequence Central Nervous System Neoplasms Child Chromosomal Instability DNA Methylation DNA Mutational Analysis Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Germinoma Humans Male Mutation Protein Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Signal Transduction Young Adult raf Kinases ras Proteins || CNS germinomas represent a unique germ cell tumor entity characterized by undifferentiated tumor cells and a high response rate to current treatment protocols. Limited information is available on their underlying genomic, epigenetic and biological alterations. We performed a genome-wide analysis of genomic copy number alterations in 49 CNS germinomas by molecular inversion profiling. In addition, CpG dinucleotide methylation was studied by immunohistochemistry for methylated cytosine residues. Mutational analysis was performed by resequencing of candidate genes including KIT and RAS family members. Ras/Erk and Akt pathway activation was analyzed by immunostaining with antibodies against phospho-Erk, phosho-Akt, phospho-mTOR and phospho-S6. All germinomas coexpressed Oct4 and Kit but showed an extensive global DNA demethylation compared to other tumors and normal tissues. Molecular inversion profiling showed predominant genomic instability in all tumors with a high frequency of regional gains and losses including high level gene amplifications. Activating mutations of KIT exons 11, 13, and 17 as well as a case with genomic KIT amplification and activating mutations or amplifications of RAS gene family members including KRAS, NRAS and RRAS2 indicated mutational activation of crucial signaling pathways. Co-activation of Ras/Erk and Akt pathways was present in 83% of germinomas. These data suggest that CNS germinoma cells display a demethylated nuclear DNA similar to primordial germ cells in early development. This finding has a striking coincidence with extensive genomic instability. In addition, mutational activation of Kit-, Ras/Raf/Erk- and Akt- pathways indicate the biological importance of these pathways and their components as potential targets for therapy.	4

Different TP53 mutants in p53 overexpressed epithelial ovarian carcinoma can be associated both with altered and unaltered glycolytic and apoptotic profiles. ||  || p53 is a tumor suppressor and key regulator of glycolysis in cancer cells, however highly mutated in tumors. In ovarian cancer, studies concerning p53 mutations focus on the DNA binding domain since the majority of hotspot mutations affects this region. Yet, mutations in other regions such as the proline rich domain may also affect the protein's expression and activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of various positions of mutations in TP53 gene on glycolysis, apoptosis and transcription of p53 target genes. Mutations frequency and their effect on p53 expression were assessed by PCR-SSCP, sequencing and immunohistochemistry on 30 ovarian cancer biopsies. Six tumors were cultured, as well as SK-OV-3, OVCAR-3 and Igrov-1. SK-OV-3 cells were transfected with 2 TP53 mutants. p53 transcriptional activity was assayed by qPCR, apoptosis by flow cytometry and glycolysis by glucose and lactate measurements, with quantification of glycolytic enzymes expression. Our results showed a high frequency of the P72R mutant, associated with p53 overexpression in the ovarian biopsies. However, P72R mutant cells showed similar apoptosis and glycolysis as WT cells. DNA binding domain mutations decreased the transcriptional activity of the protein and increased glucose consumption and lactate production. Despite the overexpression of the P72R mutated protein in the biopsies, it showed a similar apoptotic activity and glucose regulation ability as WT p53. Knowing that p53 expression status is used for chemotherapeutic approaches and prognosis in ovarian cancer, the results obtained highlight the importance of locating TP53 mutations.	0
Expression of p53 and TP53 mutational analysis in malignant neoplasms arising in preexisting spiradenoma, cylindroma, and spiradenocylindroma, sporadic or associated with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. || Adenoma Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms, Multiple Primary Point Mutation Sweat Gland Neoplasms Syndrome Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || We performed immunohistochemical assessment of p53 expression and TP53 mutational analysis of 15 malignant neoplasms arising from preexisting benign cylindroma, spiradenoma, and spiradenocylindroma, sporadic or associated with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. At least weak and focal p53 positivity was present in 13 of the 15 lesions. Successful PCR and sequencing were possible in 12 of the 15 cases. In one case only there were 2 p53 mutations, one being a c.673-1G>A splice-site mutation in the 3'-end of intron 6 (position--g.15289G>A, contig gb.AY838696.1) and the second being a c.743G>A (p.R248Q) mutation in exon 7 (position--15360G>A, contig gb.AY838696.1). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in all 12 malignant cases analyzed. As a control group, we included 12 randomly selected sporadic cases of spiradenoma (n = 5), cylindroma (n = 4), and spiradenocylindroma (n = 3). None of the 12 benign control group cases harbored a TP53 mutation, whereas all 12 demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms identical to those detected in the malignant tumor group. Immunohistochemically, 1 cylindroma and 2 spiradenomas demonstrated weak and focal p53 positivity. In conclusion, we found a fairly high rate of p53 expression in malignant neoplasms arising from preexisting benign spiradenomas, cylindromas, and spiradenocylindromas. However, the mutation rate of TP53 was low. Whereas immunostaining for p53 has been suggested as an adjunct tool to differentiate benign spiradenoma, cylindroma, and spiradenocylindroma from their malignant counterparts, its utility is limited by its heterogeneous pattern of expression, especially the sometimes lack of staining in clearly malignant areas and the occurrence of focal, weak positivity in the benign residua or in unequivocally benign neoplasms.	4

MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are known effectors of GAB2. It is amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human tumors including melanoma. Here we show a previously undescribed role for GAB2 in NRAS-driven melanoma. Specifically, we found that GAB2 is co-expressed with mutant NRAS in melanoma cell lines and tumor samples and its expression correlated with metastatic potential. Co-expression of GAB2(WT) and NRAS(G12D) in melanocytes and in melanoma cells increased anchorage-independent growth by providing GAB2-expressing cells a survival advantage through upregulation of BCL-2 family of anti-apoptotic factors. Of note, collaboration of GAB2 with mutant NRAS enhanced tumorigenesis in vivo and led to an increased vessel density with strong CD34 and VEGFR2 activity. We found that GAB2 facilitiated an angiogenic switch by upregulating HIF-1α and VEGF levels. This angiogenic response was significantly suppressed with the MEK inhibitor PD325901. These data suggest that GAB2-mediated signaling cascades collaborate with NRAS-driven downstream activation for conferring an aggressive phenotype in melanoma. Second, we show that GAB2/NRAS signaling axis is non-linear and non-redundant in melanocytes and melanoma, and thus are acting independent of each other. Finally, we establish a link between GAB2 and angiogenesis in melanoma for the first time. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that GAB2 is a novel regulator of tumor angiogenesis in NRAS-driven melanoma through regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF expressions mediated by RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling.	0
Evaluation of K-ras and p53 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma using the cancer genome atlas. || Adenocarcinoma Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Regulatory Networks Genes, p53 Genes, ras Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Mutation Pancreas Pancreatic Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) RNA, Messenger Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Genetic alterations in K-ras and p53 are thought to be critical in pancreatic cancer development and progression. However, K-ras and p53 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma have not been systematically examined in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal. Information regarding K-ras and p53 alterations, mRNA expression data, and protein/protein phosphorylation abundance was retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, and analyses were performed by the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. The mutual exclusivity analysis showed that events in K-ras and p53 were likely to co-occur in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Log odds ratio = 1.599, P = 0.006). The graphical summary of the mutations showed that there were hotspots for protein activation. In the network analysis, no solid association between K-ras and p53 was observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In the survival analysis, neither K-ras nor p53 were associated with both survival events. As in the data mining study in the TCGA databases, our study provides a new perspective to understand the genetic features of K-ras and p53 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	0
Evaluation of a 27-gene inherited cancer panel across 630 consecutive patients referred for testing in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. ||  || Extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity of inherited cancers has allowed multi-gene panel testing to become an efficient means for identification of patients with an inherited predisposition to a broad spectrum of syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of cancer. This study reports our experience with a 27-gene inherited cancer panel on a cohort of 630 consecutive individuals referred for testing at our laboratory with the following objectives: 1. Determine the rates for positive cases and those with variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) relative to data published in the recent literature, 2. Examine heterogeneity among the constituent genes on the panel, and 3. Review test uptake in the cohort relative to other reports describing outcomes for expanded panel testing. Clinical and genomic data were reviewed on 630 individuals tested on a panel of 27 genes selected on the basis of high (≥ 40%) or moderate to low (≤ 40%) lifetime risk of hereditary cancer. These patients were not enriched for adherence to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) or Lynch Syndrome (LS) and constitute a referral laboratory cohort. Sixty-five individuals with variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic across 14 genes were identified for an overall positive rate of 10.3%. Although a family history of cancer constituted a major reason for referral, accounting for 84% of our cohort, excluding patients with a known familial variant did not have a significant impact on the observed positive rate (9% vs 10.3%). More than half (58%) of the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were observed in high or moderate to low risk genes on the panel, while only 42% occurred in classic HBOC or LS-associated genes. These results provide the actual percentage of family or personal history of cancer that can be attributed to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in one or more of the genes on our panel and corroborate the utility of multi-gene panels over sequential testing to identify individuals with an inherited predisposition to cancer.	4
Connexin26 gene ( GJB2): prevalence of mutations in the Chinese population. || Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group China Connexin 26 Connexins Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Male Mutation || The connexin26 gene ( GJB2) has been shown to be responsible for DFNB1 and DFNA3 (Autosomal Recessive Hereditary Nonsyndromic Deafness Locus 1 and Autosomal Dominant Hereditary Nonsyndromic Deafness Locus 3). Two hundred ten independently ascertained Chinese probands with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) were evaluated for mutations in GJB2, including 43 probands from families with more than one sib with NSHL, likely indicating dominant inheritance, and sporadic cases of NSHL, compatible with recessive inheritance. Of the 210 probands, 43 (20%) were homozygous or heterozygous for mutations in GJB2. Four different mutations were identified: 35delG, 109G-A, 235delC, and 299-300delAT. It was confirmed that GJB2 mutations are an important cause of hearing loss in this population. Of these four mutations, 235delC was the most prevalent at 93%; yet the 35delG mutation, which is the most common GJB2 mutation in Caucasian subjects (Europeans and Americans), was found in low frequency in the present study. It appears from our limited data and reports from other East Asians that 235delC is the most prevalent GJB2 mutation in these populations. GJB2 mutations are consistent with ethnic predilections.	4
Genetics of craniosynostosis: review of the literature. || Craniosynostoses Female Genetic Counseling Homeodomain Proteins Humans Male Mutation Nuclear Proteins Pregnancy Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor Syndrome Twist-Related Protein 1 || Craniosynostosis represents a defection of the skull caused by early fusion of one or more cranial sutures. The shape alteration of the cranial vault varies, depending on the fused sutures, so that compensatory growth occurs in dimensions not restricted by sutures. Craniosynostosis can be divided into two main groups: syndromic and nonsyndromic. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is typically an isolated finding that is classified according to the suture(s) involved. Syndromic craniosynostosis is associated with various dysmorphisms involving the face, skeleton, nervous system and is usually accompanied by developmental delay. In the last 15 years, research on craniosynostosis has progressed from the description of gross abnormalities to the understanding of the genetic basis of certain cranial deformities. Mutations in the genes encoding fibroblast growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 (FGFR-1, FGFR-2, FGFR-3), TWIST and MSX2 (muscle segment homebox 2) have been identified in certain syndromic craniosynostosis. The molecular basis of many types of syndromic craniosynostosis is known and diagnostic testing strategies will often lead to a specific diagnosis. Although the clarification of a genetic lesion does not have a direct impact on the management of the patient in many cases, there is a significant benefit in providing accurate prenatal diagnosis. This review summarizes the available knowledge on cranisynostosis and presents a graduated strategy for the genetic diagnosis of these craniofacial defects.	4
Local molecular analysis of indeterminate thyroid nodules. || Adult Aged Biomarkers Biopsy, Fine-Needle DNA Mutational Analysis Female Follow-Up Studies Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pilot Projects Retrospective Studies Thyroid Gland Thyroid Nodule || Thyroid nodules are common but only a minority are malignant. Molecular testing can assist in helping determine whether indeterminate nodules are suspicious for malignancy or benign. The objective of the study was to determine if the analysis of mutations (BRAF, NRAS, KRAS and HRAS) using readily available molecular techniques can help better classify indeterminate thyroid nodules. A retrospective cohort of consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic thyroid surgery were analyzed for the presence or absence of specific mutations known to be associated with thyroid malignancy in FNA samples. Markers chosen were BRAF, NRAS, KRAS and HRAS. All were locally available and currently in use at our centre for other clinical indications. Results from the molecular analysis were then compared to the histopathology from thyroidectomy specimens to determine the sensitivity and specificity of these molecular techniques to classify indeterminate thyroid nodules. Sixty consecutive patients with indeterminate FNAs were recruited. Twenty-three patients had malignant tumors while 37 specimens were benign. Multiple different mutations were identified in the FNA samples. Overall 18 cases had a positive mutation (10 malignant and 8 benign). The sensitivity of BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS was 8.7, 8.7, 8.7, and 17.4 respectively while the specificity was100, 83.7, 100 and 94.6. While molecular analysis remains promising, it requires further refinement. Several markers showed promise as good "rule-in" tests.	4
Molecular genotyping of papillary thyroid carcinoma follicular variant according to its histological subtypes (encapsulated vs infiltrative) reveals distinct BRAF and RAS mutation patterns. || Adenocarcinoma, Papillary Adult Aged Female Genes, ras Genotype Humans Male Mass Spectrometry Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Thyroid Neoplasms || The follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma usually presents as an encapsulated tumor and less commonly as a partially/non-encapsulated infiltrative neoplasm. The encapsulated form rarely metastasizes to lymph node, whereas infiltrative tumor often harbors nodal metastases. The molecular profile of the follicular variant was shown to be close to the follicular adenoma/carcinoma group of tumors with a high RAS and very low BRAF mutation rates. A comprehensive survey of oncogenic mutations in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma according to its encapsulated and infiltrative forms has not been performed. Paraffin tissue from 28 patients with encapsulated and 19 with infiltrative follicular variant were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in thyroid carcinomas: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1 and other related genes. There was no difference in age, gender, tumor size and angioinvasion between encapsulated or infiltrative tumors. Infiltrative carcinomas had a much higher frequency of extrathyroid extension, positive margins and nodal metastases than encapsulated tumors (P<0.05). The BRAF 1799T>A mutation was found in 5 of 19 (26%) of the infiltrative tumor and in none of the encapsulated carcinomas (P=0.007). In contrast, RAS mutations were observed in 10 of 28 (36%) of the encapsulated group (5 NRAS_Q61R, 3 HRAS_Q61, 1 HRAS_G13C and 1 KRAS_Q61R) and in only 2 of 19 (10%) of infiltrative tumors (P=0.09). One encapsulated carcinoma showed a PAX8/PPARgamma rearrangement, whereas two infiltrative tumors harbored RET/PTC fusions. Encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas have a molecular profile very close to follicular adenomas/carcinomas (high rate of RAS and absence of BRAF mutations). Infiltrative follicular variant has an opposite molecular profile closer to classical papillary thyroid carcinoma than to follicular adenoma/carcinoma (BRAF>RAS mutations). The molecular profile of encapsulated and infiltrative follicular variant parallels their biological behavior (ie, metastatic nodal and invasive patterns).	4
ALK rearrangements are mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR or KRAS: an analysis of 1,683 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Crizotinib Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Rearrangement Humans Immunohistochemistry In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Male Middle Aged Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Pyrazoles Pyridines Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases ras Proteins || Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements define a distinct molecular subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, several case reports and small series have reported that ALK rearrangements can overlap with other oncogenic drivers in NSCLC in crizotinib-naïve and crizotinib-resistant cancers. We reviewed clinical genotyping data from 1,683 patients with NSCLC and investigated the prevalence of concomitant EGFR or KRAS mutations among patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. We also examined biopsy specimens from 34 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC after the development of resistance to crizotinib. Screening identified 301 (17.8%) EGFR mutations, 465 (27.6%) KRAS mutations, and 75 (4.4%) ALK rearrangements. EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements were mutually exclusive. Four patients with KRAS mutations were found to have abnormal ALK FISH patterns, most commonly involving isolated 5' green probes. Sufficient tissue was available for confirmatory ALK immunohistochemistry in 3 cases, all of which were negative for ALK expression. Among patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who acquired resistance to crizotinib, repeat biopsy specimens were ALK FISH positive in 29 of 29 (100%) cases. Secondary mutations in the ALK kinase domain and ALK gene amplification were observed in 7 of 34 (20.6%) and 3 of 29 (10.3%) cases, respectively. No EGFR or KRAS mutations were identified among any of the 25 crizotinib-resistant, ALK-positive patients with sufficient tissue for testing. Functional ALK rearrangements were mutually exclusive with EGFR and KRAS mutations in a large Western patient population. This lack of overlap was also observed in ALK-positive cancers with acquired resistance to crizotinib.	4
Growth suppression by dual BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61) oncogene expression is mediated by SPRY4 in melanoma. ||  || The underlying forces that shape mutational patterns within any type of cancer have been poorly characterized. One of the best preserved exclusionary relationships is that between BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61) in melanomas. To explore possible mechanisms which could explain this phenomenon, we overexpressed NRAS(Q61) in a set of BRAF(V600E) melanoma lines and vice versa. Controlled expression of a second activating oncogene led to growth arrest ("synthetic suppression") in a subset of cells, which was accompanied by cell cycle arrest and senescence in several melanoma cell lines along with apoptosis. Through differential gene expression analysis, we identified SPRY4 as the potential mediator of this synthetic response to dual oncogene suppression. Ectopic introduction of SPRY4 recapitulated the growth arrest phenotype of dual BRAF(V600E)/NRAS(Q61) expression while SPRY4 depletion led to a partial rescue from oncogenic antagonism. This study thus defined SPRY4 as a potential mediator of synthetic suppression, which is likely to contribute to the observed exclusivity between BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61R) mutations in melanoma. Further leverage of the SPRY4 pathway may also hold therapeutic promise for NRAS(Q61) melanomas.	0
Loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 trigger autophagy-dependent cell death in glioblastoma cells. ||  || Autophagy is a well-described degradation mechanism that promotes cell survival upon nutrient starvation and other forms of cellular stresses. In addition, there is growing evidence showing that autophagy can exert a lethal function via autophagic cell death (ACD). As ACD has been implicated in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma (GBM), there is a high medical need for identifying novel ACD-inducing drugs. Therefore, we screened a library containing 70 autophagy-inducing compounds to induce ATG5-dependent cell death in human MZ-54 GBM cells. Here, we identified three compounds, i.e. loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 that significantly induce cell death in several GBM cell lines compared to CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATG5- or ATG7-deficient cells, pointing to a death-promoting role of autophagy. Further cell death analyses conducted using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis only play minor roles in loperamide-, pimozide- or STF-62247-induced cell death. Intriguingly, these three compounds induce massive lipidation of the autophagy marker protein LC3B as well as the formation of LC3B puncta, which are characteristic of autophagy. Furthermore, loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 enhance the autophagic flux in parental MZ-54 cells, but not in ATG5 or ATG7 knockout (KO) MZ-54 cells. In addition, loperamide- and pimozide-treated cells display a massive formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes at the ultrastructural level. Finally, stimulation of autophagy by all three compounds is accompanied by dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. In summary, our results indicate that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce ATG5- and ATG7-dependent cell death in GBM cells, which is preceded by a massive induction of autophagy. These findings emphasize the lethal function and potential clinical relevance of hyperactivated autophagy in GBM.	0
Mechanism of rescue of common p53 cancer mutations by second-site suppressor mutations. || DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Models, Molecular Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Protein Conformation Protein Folding Proteins Suppression, Genetic Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Urea || The core domain of p53 is extremely susceptible to mutations that lead to loss of function. We analysed the stability and DNA-binding activity of such mutants to understand the mechanism of second-site suppressor mutations. Double-mutant cycles show that N239Y and N268D act as 'global stability' suppressors by increasing the stability of the cancer mutants G245S and V143A-the free energy changes are additive. Conversely, the suppressor H168R is specific for the R249S mutation: despite destabilizing wild type, H168R has virtually no effect on the stability of R249S, but restores its binding affinity for the gadd45 promoter. NMR structural comparisons of R249S/H168R and R249S/T123A/H168R with wild type and R249S show that H168R reverts some of the structural changes induced by R249S. These results have implications for possible drug therapy to restore the function of tumorigenic mutants of p53: the function of mutants such as V143A and G245S is theoretically possible to restore by small molecules that simply bind to and hence stabilize the native structure, whereas R249S requires alteration of its mutant native structure.	0
The Prognostic Value of HRAS mRNA Expression in Cutaneous Melanoma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Melanoma Middle Aged Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) RNA, Messenger Skin Neoplasms Young Adult || This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of HRAS mRNA expression in cutaneous melanoma. Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive cancer with an increasing incidence. Few studies have focused on the transcriptional level of RAS isoforms (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS) in cutaneous melanoma. To gain further insight into RAS isoforms at transcriptional level, we obtained the cutaneous melanoma data from cBioPortal and investigated the RAS mRNA expression levels in different stages of melanoma and evaluated their correlation with clinical characteristics and patients' survival. Furthermore, we retrieved and analyzed the coexpression data and performed pathway enrichment analysis. Totally, 452 cutaneous melanoma cases were included in this study. We found that lower HRAS expression level was associated with longer patient survival. 206 genes that negatively correlated with HRAS expression were positively correlated with KRAS and NRAS expression. In contrast, no gene that positively correlated with HRAS expression was positively correlated with KRAS and NRAS expression. In conclusion, our data showed that transcriptional regulation was different for the three RAS isoforms in cutaneous melanoma. This study highlighted the prognostic value of HRAS mRNA expression and revealed that HRAS greatly differs from KRAS and NRAS at the transcriptional level.	4
Recurrent TP53 missense mutation in cancer patients of Arab descent. || Adolescent Adult Aged Arabs Breast Neoplasms Carcinoma Carcinoma, Papillary Colonic Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Fathers Female Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genes, p53 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Germ-Line Mutation Glioblastoma Heterozygote Humans Leukemia Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Thyroid Cancer, Papillary Thyroid Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Hereditary cancer comprises more than 10% of all breast cancer cases. Identification of germinal mutations enables the initiation of a preventive program that can include early detection or preventive treatment and may also have a major impact on cancer therapy. Several recurrent mutations were identified in the BRCA1/2 genes in Jewish populations however, in other ethnic groups in Israel, no recurrent mutations were identified to date. Our group established panel sequencing in cancer patients to identify recurrent, founder, and new mutations in the heterogeneous and diverse populations in Israel, We evaluated five breast cancer patients of Arab descent diagnosed with cancer before the age of 50 years and identified the previously described TP53 mutation, c.541C>T, R181C (rs587782596), in two women from unrelated Arab families. The two probands were diagnosed with breast cancer at a young age (27 and 34 years) and had significant family history spanning a wide range of tumors (breast cancer (BC), papillary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma multiform (GBM), colon cancer and leukemia). The R181C variant is expected to disrupt p53 at the ASPP2 binding domain but not the DNA binding domain and is defined by Clinvar as likely pathogenic and in HGMD as disease mutation. We further tested 85 unrelated Arab cancer patients and father of a BC carrier patient for TP53 c.541C>T using a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach and identified four additional carriers, two with BC one with lung cancer, and the father of a BC carrier patient, diagnosed with GBM. Another carrier suffering from BC was identified using a Myriad panel, suggesting a recurrent mutation in this population with a frequency of 5/42 (11.9%) of our selected BC patients. We suggest testing Arab women with a breast cancer at a young age, Arab patients with multiple malignancies, or with suggestive family history for TP53 c.541C>T.	4
Mendelian randomization in nutritional epidemiology. || Alcohol Drinking Biomarkers C-Reactive Protein Cardiovascular Diseases Diet Epidemiology Female Genetic Variation Heredity Humans Life Style Neoplasms Nutritional Physiological Phenomena Obesity Pregnancy Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic || Nutritional epidemiology aims to identify dietary and lifestyle causes for human diseases. Causality inference in nutritional epidemiology is largely based on evidence from studies of observational design, and may be distorted by unmeasured or residual confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization is a recently developed methodology that combines genetic and classical epidemiological analysis to infer causality for environmental exposures, based on the principle of Mendel's law of independent assortment. Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures of interest. Associations derived from Mendelian randomization analysis are less likely to be affected by confounding and reverse causation. During the past 5 years, a body of studies examined the causal effects of diet/lifestyle factors and biomarkers on a variety of diseases. The Mendelian randomization approach also holds considerable promise in the study of intrauterine influences on offspring health outcomes. However, the application of Mendelian randomization in nutritional epidemiology has some limitations.	4
An unexpected inhibition of antiviral signaling by virus-encoded tumor suppressor p53 in pancreatic cancer cells. || Cell Line, Tumor Host-Pathogen Interactions Humans Interferon Type I Recombinant Proteins Signal Transduction Transgenes Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vesiculovirus Viral Proteins Virus Replication || Virus-encoded tumor suppressor p53 transgene expression has been successfully used in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and other oncolytic viruses (OVs) to enhance their anticancer activities. However, p53 is also known to inhibit virus replication via enhanced type I interferon (IFN) antiviral responses. To examine whether p53 transgenes enhance antiviral signaling in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, we engineered novel VSV recombinants encoding human p53 or the previously described chimeric p53-CC, which contains the coiled-coil (CC) domain from breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein and evades the dominant-negative activities of endogenously expressed mutant p53. Contrary to an expected enhancement of antiviral signaling by p53, our global analysis of gene expression in PDAC cells showed that both p53 and p53-CC dramatically inhibited type I IFN responses. Our data suggest that this occurs through p53-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Importantly, VSV-encoded p53 or p53-CC did not inhibit antiviral signaling in non-malignant human pancreatic ductal cells, which retained their resistance to all tested VSV recombinants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of p53-mediated inhibition of antiviral signaling, and it suggests that OV-encoded p53 can simultaneously produce anticancer activities while assisting, rather than inhibiting, virus replication in cancer cells.	0
Easy, rapid, and cost-effective methods for identifying carriers of recurrent GJB2 mutations causing nonsyndromic hearing impairment in the Greek population. || Base Sequence Connexin 26 Connexins Cost-Benefit Analysis DNA Primers Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Testing Greece Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Sequence Deletion || A variety of techniques have been developed for screening the GJB2 gene for known and unknown mutations, especially the most common mutation in the Caucasian population, the c.35delG. Other mutations that have been so far characterized in the GJB2 gene seem to have different geographical distributions, and therefore there is an interest in identifying recurrent mutations specific for each population and developing easy and rapid screening techniques. Here we present easy screening protocols for already identified recurrent mutations in the Greek population. Developing easy, rapid, and cost-effective screening methods will facilitate the detection of GJB2 recurrent mutation carriers, at large, in the Greek population.	4
Active Constituents from Liriope platyphylla Root against Cancer Growth In Vitro. ||  || Liriope spicata is a well-known herb in traditional Chinese medicine, and its root has been clinically demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of metabolic and neural disorders. The constituents isolated from Liriope have also recently been shown to possess anticancer activity, although the mechanism of which remains largely unknown. Here, we illustrate the anticancer activity of LPRP-9, one of the active fractions we fractionated from the Liriope platyphylla root part (LPRP) extract. Treatment with LPRP-9 significantly inhibited proliferation of cancer cell lines MCF-7 and Huh-7 and down-regulated the phosphorylation of AKT. LPRP-9 also activates the stress-activated MPAK, JNK, p38 pathways, the p53 cell-cycle checkpoint pathway, and a series of caspase cascades while downregulating expression of antiapoptotic factors Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and survivin. Such activities strongly suggest a role for LPRP-9 in apoptosis and autophagy. We further purified and identified the compound (-)-Liriopein B from LPRP-9, which is capable of inhibiting AKT phosphorylation at low concentration. The overall result highlights the anticancer property of LPRP-9, suggests its mechanism for inhibition of proliferation and promotion of cell death for cancer cells via regulation of multitarget pathways, and denotes the importance of purifying components of fraction LPRP-9 to aid cancer therapy.	0
Cognitive profile of disorders associated with dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cognition Disorders Developmental Disabilities Female Humans Infant MAP Kinase Kinase 1 MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Mutation Phenotype Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) SOS1 Protein Young Adult ras Proteins || Mutations in genes coding for transducers participating in the RAS/MAPK pathway have been identified as the molecular cause underlying a group of clinically related developmental disorders with cognitive deficits of variable severity. To determine the spectrum of cognitive defects associated with dysregulation of this signal cascade, we studied the profile of cognitive abilities in patients with mutations affecting the PTPN11, SOS1, HRAS, KRAS, BRAF, RAF1, and MEK1 genes and phenotype-genotype correlations. Our findings support the observation that heterogeneity in cognitive abilities can be at least partially ascribed to the individual affected genes and type of mutation involved. While mutations affecting transducers upstream of RAS were less frequently associated with mental retardation, mutations in downstream components of the pathway were generally associated with a more severe cognitive impairment. Among patients with a heterozygous PTPN11 mutation, the T468M substitution was associated with a mean IQ significantly higher compared to that of individuals carrying the N308D change. Our study provides insights on the range of cognitive abilities in patients with gene mutations causing dysregulation of RAS signaling suggesting that the presence and severity of cognitive involvement can be predicted in part by the gene involved.	4
The SMAC mimetic BV6 sensitizes colorectal cancer cells to ionizing radiation by interfering with DNA repair processes and enhancing apoptosis. || Apoptosis Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Repair Flow Cytometry Fluorescent Antibody Technique Gene Knockdown Techniques Humans Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins Oligopeptides RNA, Small Interfering Radiation-Sensitizing Agents Transfection || In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of counteracting inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins using the small molecule Second Mitochondria-derived Activator of Caspase (SMAC) mimetic BV6 in combination with ionizing radiation on apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, three-dimensional (3D) clonogenic survival and expression of IAPs in colorectal carcinoma cells. Colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-15, HT-29, SW480) were subjected to BV6 treatment (0-4 μM) with or without irradiation (2-8 Gy, single dose) followed by MTT, Caspase 3/7 activity, γH2AX/53BP1 foci assays, AnnexinV staining, cell cycle analysis, 3D colony forming assays and Western blotting (cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2, Survivin, X-linked IAP (XIAP)). BV6 treatment decreased cell viability and significantly increased irradiation-induced apoptosis as analyzed by Caspase 3/7 activity, AnnexinV-positive and subG1 phase cells. While basal 3D clonogenic survival was decreased in a cell line-dependent manner, BV6 significantly enhanced cellular radiosensitivity of all cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner and increased the number of radiation-induced γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci. Western blot analysis revealed a markedly reduced cIAP1 expression at 4 h after BV6 treatment in all cell lines, a substantial reduction of XIAP expression in SW480 and HT-29 cells at 24 h and a slightly decreased cIAP2 expression in HCT-15 cells at 48 h after treatment. Moreover, single or double knockdown of cIAP1 and XIAP resulted in significantly increased residual γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci 24 h after 2 Gy and radiosensitization relative to control small interfering RNA (siRNA)-treated cells. The SMAC mimetic BV6 induced apoptosis and hampered DNA damage repair to radiosensitize 3D grown colorectal cancer cells. Our results demonstrate IAP targeting as a promising strategy to counteract radiation resistance of colorectal cancer cells.	0
Wee1 is required to sustain ATR/Chk1 signaling upon replicative stress. || Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Checkpoint Kinase 1 Deoxycytidine Drug Synergism Humans Nuclear Proteins Pancreatic Neoplasms Protein Kinase Inhibitors Protein Kinases Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Signal Transduction || The therapeutic efficacy of nucleoside analogues, e.g. gemcitabine, against cancer cells can be augmented by inhibitors of checkpoint kinases, including Wee1, ATR, and Chk1. We have compared the chemosensitizing effect of these inhibitors in cells derived from pancreatic cancer, a tumor entity where gemcitabine is part of the first-line therapeutic regimens, and in osteosarcoma-derived cells. As expected, all three inhibitors rendered cancer cells more sensitive to gemcitabine, but Wee1 inhibition proved to be particularly efficient in this context. Investigating the reasons for this potent sensitizing effect, we found that Wee1 inhibition or knockdown not only blocked Wee1 activity, but also reduced the activation of ATR/Chk1 in gemcitabine-treated cells. Combination of several inhibitors revealed that Wee1 inhibition requires Cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (Cdk1/2) and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to reduce ATR/Chk1 activity. Through activation of Cdks and Plk1, Wee1 inhibition reduces Claspin and CtIP levels, explaining the impairment in ATR/Chk1 activity. Taken together, these results confer a consistent signaling pathway reaching from Wee1 inhibition to impaired Chk1 activity, mechanistically dissecting how Wee1 inhibitors not only dysregulate cell cycle progression, but also enhance replicative stress and chemosensitivity towards nucleoside analogues.	0
[Characteristics of the PAH gene mutation in Chinese patients with phenylketonuria in Xinjiang]. ||  || To study the characteristics of the PAH gene mutation in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Xinjiang area. The mutations in exons 3, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 and the flanking intronic sequence of the PAH gene were detected by PCR/SSCP analysis and direct DNA sequencing in 46 PKU patients. Twenty different mutations were found in 68/92 alleles (73.9%). The prevalent mutations of R243Q, EX6 96A>G, R111X, Y356X and V399V were similar to that of Northern China populations. The mutations F161S, L255S, P281L, and R413P were significantly different from that in other Chinese populations. It was the second time that E280G and A434D mutations were reported in the world, that L255S, P281L, R261Q, and I65T mutations were found in China. Thirteen different mutations were first found in Chinese Uygur, which showed a distinct ethnic characteristics. The study showed not only a distinct and conservative, but also a crossed and syncretic genetic characteristics in Xinjiang Uygur population. The results suggest that Xinjiang could be an ideal genetic resource repertoire for studying diversity of gene mutations, heterogeneity of PAH gene, human origins and migration.	3
Unraveling the Connection between Fibroblast Growth Factor and Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling. || Animals Bone Morphogenetic Proteins Disease Susceptibility Fibroblast Growth Factors Humans Organ Specificity Protein Binding Signal Transduction || Ontogeny of higher organisms as well the regulation of tissue homeostasis in adult individuals requires a fine-balanced interplay of regulating factors that individually trigger the fate of particular cells to either stay undifferentiated or to differentiate towards distinct tissue specific lineages. In some cases, these factors act synergistically to promote certain cellular responses, whereas in other tissues the same factors antagonize each other. However, the molecular basis of this obvious dual signaling activity is still only poorly understood. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are two major signal protein families that have a lot in common: They are both highly preserved between different species, involved in essential cellular functions, and their ligands vastly outnumber their receptors, making extensive signal regulation necessary. In this review we discuss where and how BMP and FGF signaling cross paths. The compiled data reflect that both factors synchronously act in many tissues, and that antagonism and synergism both exist in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, by challenging a generalization of the connection between these two pathways a new chapter in BMP FGF signaling research will be introduced.	0
Diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease and other muscle disorders by next-generation sequencing. || Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Child Child, Preschool Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Infant Male Muscular Diseases Young Adult || Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is a rare treatable lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive lysosomal glycogen accumulation and muscle weakness, with often a limb-girdle pattern. Despite published guidelines, testing for LOPD is often overlooked or delayed in adults, owing to its low frequency compared to other muscle disorders with similar muscle patterns. Next-generation sequencing has the capability to test concurrently for several muscle disorders. This could potentially lead to increased diagnosis of LOPD, disorders with non-specific muscle weakness or atypical patients. We developed a gene panel to further study its clinical utility in a cohort of patients with suspected muscle disorders. We designed a gene panel to analyze the coding sequences and splice site junctions of GAA causing LOPD, along with 77 other genes causing muscle disorders with overlapping phenotypes. At a median coverage of ~200X (sequences per base), all GAA exons were successfully covered with >20X and only 0.3 % of exons across all genes were <20X. The panel showed an excellent sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (98 %) across all selected genes, using known variations in Pompe patients and controls. We determined its clinical utility by analyzing 34 patients with suspected muscle disorders of undetermined etiology and various muscle patterns, who were referred or followed in neuromuscular and genetics clinics. A putative diagnosis was found in up to 32 % of patients. The gene panel was instrumental in reaching a diagnosis in atypical patients, including one LOPD case. Acid alpha-glucosidase activity was used to confirm the molecular results in all patients. This work highlights the high clinical utility of gene panels in patients with suspected muscle disorders and its potential to facilitate the diagnosis of patients showing non-specific muscle weakness or atypical phenotypes. We propose that gene panels should be used as a first-tier test in patients with suspected muscle disorders of undetermined etiology, which could further increase overall diagnosis of muscle conditions, and potentially reduce diagnostic delay. Further studies are necessary to determine the impact of first-tier gene panels on diagnostic delay and on treatment outcome for LOPD.	1
Genetic variation at the CYP2C19 gene associated with metabolic syndrome susceptibility in a South Portuguese population: results from the pilot study of the European Health Examination Survey in Portugal. ||  || Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Since pathways implicated in different diseases reveal surprising insights into shared genetic bases underlying apparently unrelated traits, we hypothesize that there are common genetic components involved in the clustering of MetS traits. With the aim of identifying these common genetic components, we have performed a genetic association study by integrating MetS traits in a continuous MetS score. A cross-sectional study developed in the context of the Portuguese Component of the European Health Examination Survey (EHES) was used. Data was collected through a detailed questionnaire and physical examination. Blood samples were collected and biochemical analyses were performed. Waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels were used to compute a continuous MetS score, obtained by Principal Component Analysis. A total of 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped and individually tested for association with the score, adjusting for confounding variables. A total of 206 individuals were studied. Calculated MetS score increased progressively with increasing number of risk factors (P < 0.001). We found a significant association between CYP2C19 rs4244285 and the MetS score not detected using the MetS dichotomic approach. Individuals with the A allelic variant seem to be protected against MetS, displaying a lower MetS score (Mean difference: 0.847; 95%CI: 0.163-1.531; P = 0.015), after adjustment for age, gender, smoking status, excessive alcohol consumption and physical inactivity. An additive genetic effect of GABRA2 rs279871, NPY rs16147 and TPMT rs1142345 in the MetS score variation was also found. This is the first report of a genetic association study using a continuous MetS score. The significant association found between the CYP2C19 polymorphism and the MetS score but not with the individual associated traits, emphasizes the importance of lipid metabolism in a MetS common etiological pathway and consequently on the clustering of different cardiovascular risk factors. Despite the sample size limitation of our study, this strategy can be useful to find genetic factors involved in the etiology of other disorders that are defined in a dichotomized way.	4
Audio profiles in mitochondrial deafness m.1555A>G and m.3243A>G show distinct differences. ||  || Hearing loss is one of the most common symptoms of mitochondrial disorders. However, audiological phenotypes associated with different molecular defects in mtDNA are not yet well characterized. A large cohort of 1499 nonconsanguineous patients aged 5-40 years with hearing loss of unknown etiology was screened for mutations in mtDNA. For further analysis, patients harboring m.1555A>G and m.3243A>G were selected. Hearing status of the patients was assessed by pure tone audiometry. Patterns of audiograms (hearing threshold levels at each examined frequency) were statistically compared among the carriers of the m.1555A>G and the m.3243A>G mutations. We identified 20 patients positive for m.1555A>G mutation and 16 patients positive for m.3243A>G change. The frequency of the above transitions was calculated in our cohort as 1.33% and 1.06%, respectively. Seventeen affected family members carrying the mutations were included into the study. Typical shape of the audiograms in patients with m.1555A>G mutation presented a ski-slope pattern, whereas the audiometric curves among the m.3243A>G individuals had a pantonal shape (a flat curve) with slight downward sloping at the higher frequencies. The differences were statistically significant. The onset of hearing loss was noted earlier among m.1555A>G than m.3243A>G patients (12.5 and 26 years, respectively). Aminoglycoside administration was declared in both groups in 11 and 4 cases respectively, and caused abrupt hearing deterioration in all cases. A pattern of audiogram in patients with mitochondrial deafness may suggest a localization of mtDNA mutation. The pathogenesis of the audiometric differences needs further study.	4
p53 signaling modulation of cell cycle arrest and viral replication in porcine circovirus type 2 infection cells. || Animals Blotting, Western CRISPR-Cas Systems Cell Cycle Circoviridae Infections Circovirus Cyclin A Gene Knockdown Techniques Signal Transduction Swine Swine Diseases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Virus Replication || Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a ubiquitous pathogen in the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies have shown that PCV2 infection induces host cell apoptosis through up-regulation of p53. To further identify the regulatory roles of p53 signaling in the process of PCV2 infection, we established p53 gene knockout PK15 cell lines using the genomic editor tool CRISPR/Cas9, and further investigated the roles of p53 in modulating the cell cycle and viral replication in this study. The results show that PCV2 infection induced obvious S phase accumulation in wild-type PK15 cells and a compromised S phase accumulation in the p53 gene mutation cells (813PK15 p53m/m ), but did not induce obvious S phase accumulation in the p53 gene knockout cells (148PK15p53-/-) compared with the respective mock infection. PCV2 infection activated p53 signaling, up-regulated the expression of p21, Cyclin E, and down-regulated Cyclin A, CDK2. In p53 deficient cells, however, PCV2-induced changes in Cyclin A, CDK2, and Cyclin E were efficiently reversed to the basal levels. Detection of PCV2 replication showed decreased viral ORF1 genomic DNA in p53 deficient cells (148PK15p533-/-) and p53 mutated cells (813PK15p53m/m ) compared with p53 wild-type cells after different synchronization treatment. Furthermore, PCV2 viral genomic DNA and Cap protein levels were higher in the cells released from S phase synchronized cells than in the cells released from the G0/G1 phase or G2/M phase-synchronized, or asynchronous cells after 18 h post-infection. Taken together, this study demonstrates that PCV2 infection induces S phase accumulation to favor viral replication in host cells through activation of the p53 pathway.	0
Sudden infant death syndrome due to long QT syndrome: a brief review of the genetic substrate and prevalence. ||  || The pathophysiological mechanisms which lead to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) are not completely understood. Cardiac channelopathies are a well-established causative factor with long QT syndrome (LQTS) being the most frequent one, accounting for approximately 12% of SIDS cases. The genetic substrate of the above arrhythmogenic syndrome has been thoroughly described but only specific gene mutations or polymorphisms have been identified as SIDS causative. The review will focus on the prevalence of LQTS-induced SIDS or near-SIDS cases and the mutations held responsible. A literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus electronic databases. Search terms used were: long QT syndrome, channelopathies, QT prolongation, cardiac ion channels. The above-mentioned search terms were always combined with the term: sudden infant death syndrome. Study types considered eligible were: case-control, family pedigree analysis, case reports. The prevalence of LQTS-induced SIDS according to six broad genetic studies ranges from 3.9 to 20.6%, with an average of 12%. Since LQTS can be effectively managed, LQTS-related SIDS cases could be prevented, provided that a screening method is efficient enough to detect all the affected infants.	4
[Prenatal screening and diagnosis of genetic deafness by microarray]. || Adult Connexins Deafness Female Genetic Counseling Genetic Testing Humans Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Pregnancy Pregnancy Trimester, Second Prenatal Diagnosis Young Adult || To evaluate a microarray-based mutation screening method for genetic deafness and its application in prenatal diagnosis. Mutation screening of common deafness genes was performed in pregnant women and volunteers spouses. Nine common mutations in four major deafness genes, GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4 and mitochondrial 12S rRNA, were detected simultaneously by a microarray-based method. Genetic counseling was given based on their testing results. 5.11% of pregnant women carried at least one mutation. Among them, seven carried mutation in the mitochondria 12S rRNA gene and were offered aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity warning. For other mutation carriers of GJB2 or SLC26A4 genes, additional mutation screening was performed in their husbands by direct sequencing. A total of 20 couples were at risk of giving birth to children with genetic deafness. Of five couples who selected to undergo prenatal diagnostic testing of the fetus, four were diagnosed as wild type or heterozygous for the tested genes and one as p.V37I/c.235delC compound heterozygous for GJB2. DNA microarray is a quick, easy and reliable method to screen mutations in genetic deafness genes. Application of this method in prenatal screening and diagnosis might effectively reduce the occurrence of genetic deafness.	4
PTEN/PTENP1: 'Regulating the regulator of RTK-dependent PI3K/Akt signalling', new targets for cancer therapy. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Humans MicroRNAs Neoplasms PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction || Regulation of the PI-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway is essential for maintaining the integrity of fundamental cellular processes, cell growth, survival, death and metabolism, and dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in the development and progression of cancers. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are major upstream regulators of PI3K/Akt signalling. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a well characterised tumour suppressor, is a prime antagonist of PI3K and therefore a negative regulator of this pathway. Loss or inactivation of PTEN, which occurs in many tumour types, leads to overactivation of RTK/PI3K/Akt signalling driving tumourigenesis. Cellular PTEN levels are tightly regulated by a number of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms. Of particular interest, transcription of the PTEN pseudogene, PTENP1, produces sense and antisense transcripts that exhibit post-transcriptional and transcriptional modulation of PTEN expression respectively. These additional levels of regulatory complexity governing PTEN expression add to the overall intricacies of the regulation of RTK/PI-3 K/Akt signalling. This review will discuss the regulation of oncogenic PI3K signalling by PTEN (the regulator) with a focus on the modulatory effects of the sense and antisense transcripts of PTENP1 on PTEN expression, and will further explore the potential for new therapeutic opportunities in cancer treatment.	0
KIT, NRAS and BRAF mutations in sinonasal mucosal melanoma: a study of 56 cases. || Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Laser Capture Microdissection Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Paraffin Embedding Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Survival Rate || Mucosal melanomas in the head and neck region are most frequently located in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Sinonasal mucosal melanoma (SNMM) comprises <1% of all melanomas. The aim was to determine the KIT, NRAS and BRAF mutation frequencies in a large series of primary SNMMs. Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate tumour cells from 56 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumours. The tumour cells were screened for KIT, NRAS and BRAF mutations by direct sequencing. Overall, 21% (12 out of 56) of SNMMs harboured KIT, NRAS or BRAF mutations. Mutations in these oncogenes occurred in a mutually exclusive manner. Both KIT and BRAF mutations were identified at a similar frequency of 4% each (2 out of 56), whereas NRAS mutations were detected in 14% (8 out of 56) of the SNMMs. Four of the NRAS mutations were located in exon 1. Mutations in these oncogenes were significantly more common in melanomas located in the paranasal sinuses than in nasal cavity (P=0.045). In a multivariate analysis, patients with melanomas in the nasal cavity had a significantly better overall survival than those with tumours in the paranasal sinuses (P=0.027). Our findings show that KIT and BRAF mutations, which are accessible for present targeted therapies, are only rarely present in SNMMs, whereas NRAS mutations seem to be relatively more frequent. The data show that majority of SNMMs harbour alterations in genes other than KIT, NRAS and BRAF.	4
Mutation of the MYH7 gene in a child with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. || Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Child Electrocardiography Genes, Dominant Humans Male Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) displays autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetration of defective genes. Data concerning the familial occurrence of ventricular preexcitation, i.e. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, also indicate autosomal dominant inheritance. In the literature, only a gene mutation on chromosome 7q3 has been described in familial HCM coexisting with WPW syndrome to date. The present paper describes the case of a 7-year-old boy with HCM and coexisting WPW syndrome. On his chromosome 14, molecular diagnostics revealed a C 9123 mutation (arginine changed into cysteine in position 453) in exon 14 in a copy of the gene for beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7). It is the first known case of mutation of the MYH7 gene in a child with both HCM and WPW. Since no linkage between MYH7 mutation and HCM with WPW syndrome has been reported to date, we cannot conclude whether the observed mutation is a common cause for both diseases, or this patient presents an incidental co-occurrence of HCM (caused by MYH7 mutation) and WPW syndrome.	4
Early T-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in an Infant With an NRAS Q61R Mutation and Clinical Features of Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia. || Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Infant Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile Male Membrane Proteins Mutation, Missense Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma || Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) is a subtype of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) arising from a primitive precursor. We present a unique case of an infant with ETP-ALL with a missense NRAS mutation in codon 61 (c.182A>G, p.Q61R). The patient also had a minor population of non-ETP T-ALL blasts and clinical features typically associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), namely, absolute monocytosis, splenomegaly, and elevated hemoglobin F. The treatment was initiated with chemotherapy, followed by cord blood transplantation. The patient achieved remission, but unfortunately died from transplant-related complications. This case highlights an NRAS mutation in ETP-ALL with JMML-like phenotype.	4
Genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Calcium Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Genetic Association Studies Humans Mutation Sarcomeres || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited cardiac disorder, exhibits remarkable genetic and clinical heterogeneity. This manuscript reviews recent discoveries of disease-causing genes and their clinical consequences, and provides an overview of research that aims to elucidate how HCM ensues from a single-nucleotide mutation. The spectrum of genes that are mutated in HCM has expanded. In combination with newly developed sequencing technologies, there are now robust strategies for gene-based diagnosis in HCM. Understanding the molecular pathophysiology of HCM has emerged from the study of genetically engineered animal models of disease, and new data indicate important roles for altered intracellular Ca²⁺ regulation and oxidative stress. Pharmacologic strategies to normalize these processes show promise in attenuating HCM in experimental models. The current repertoire of HCM genes allows effective gene-based diagnosis, information that enables accurate assessment of disease risk in family members, and provides some insight into clinical course. From mechanistic insights gleaned from fundamental investigations of experimental HCM models, novel therapeutic targets that may provide new benefits for HCM patients have surfaced.	4
Targeted next generation sequencing reveals unique mutation profile of primary melanocytic tumors of the central nervous system. || Adolescent Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Central Nervous System Neoplasms DNA Copy Number Variations Female Follow-Up Studies High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunoenzyme Techniques Male Melanoma Meningeal Neoplasms Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Skin Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Proteins Ubiquitin Thiolesterase Young Adult || Melanocytic tumors originating in the central nervous system (MT-CNS) are rare tumors that generally have a favorable prognosis, however malignant tumors do occur. Pathogenetically MT-CNS are not well characterized. Similar to uveal melanoma and blue nevi, they frequently harbor activating GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. Rare NRAS mutations have also been reported. Other mutations have not yet been described. We analyzed 19 MT-CNS, 7 uveal melanomas and 19 cutaneous melanomas using a targeted next generation sequencing approach analyzing 29 genes known to be frequently mutated in other melanocytic tumors (in particular uveal and cutaneous melanomas). In concordance with previous studies, cutaneous melanoma samples showed frequent NRAS or BRAF mutations, as well as mutations in other genes (e.g. NF1, RAC1, PIK3CA, ARID1A). Metastasized uveal melanomas exhibited mutations in GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1. In contrast, MT-CNS almost exclusively demonstrated mutations in GNAQ (71 %) or GNA11 (12 %). Interestingly both GNA11 mutations identified were detected in MT-CNS diagnosed as intermediate grade melanocytomas which also recurred. One of these recurrent cases also harbored an inactivating BAP1 mutation and was found to have lost one copy of chromosome 3. Our findings show that while MT-CNS do have GNAQ or GNA11 mutations, they rarely harbor other recurrent mutations found in uveal or cutaneous melanomas. Considering chromosome 3 and BAP1 loss are robust markers of poor prognosis in uveal melanoma, it will prove interesting to determine whether these genomic alterations are also of prognostic significance in MT-CNS.	4
Suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha restores p53 activity via Hdm2 and reverses chemoresistance of renal carcinoma cells. || Antibodies Apoptosis Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors Carcinoma, Renal Cell Cell Line, Tumor Doxorubicin Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Kidney Neoplasms Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 fas Receptor || p53 mutations are rarely detected in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), but, paradoxically, these tumors remain highly resistant to chemotherapy and death receptor-induced death. Here, we show that the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2alpha), a critical oncogenic event in CCRCC following the loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, leads to Hdm2-mediated suppression of p53. Primary CCRCC specimens exhibiting strong hypoxic signatures show increased levels of activated nuclear phospho-Hdm2(Ser(166)), which is concomitant with low p53 expression. The abrogation of Hdm2-p53 interaction using the small-molecule Hdm2 inhibitor nutlin-3 or the downregulation of HIF2alpha via HIF2alpha-specific short hairpin RNA or wild-type VHL reconstitution restores p53 function and reverses the resistance of CCRCC cells to Fas-mediated and chemotherapy-induced cell death. These findings unveil a mechanistic link between HIF2alpha and p53 and provide a rationale for combining Hdm2 antagonists with chemotherapy for the treatment of CCRCC.	0
Downregulation of cyclin D1 sensitizes cancer cells to MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3. || Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin D1 Down-Regulation Gene Knockdown Techniques HEK293 Cells Humans Imidazoles MCF-7 Cells Neoplasms Piperazines Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The MDM2-p53 pathway has a prominent oncogenic function in the pathogenesis of various cancers. Nutlin-3, a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2-p53 interaction, inhibits proliferation in cancer cells with wild-type p53. Herein, we evaluate the expression of MDM2, both the full length and a splicing variant MDM2-A, and the sensitivity of Nutlin-3 in different cancer cell lines. Included are seven cell lines with wild-type p53 (four mesothelioma, one breast cancer, one chondrosarcoma, and one leiomyosarcoma), two liposarcoma cell lines harboring MDM2 amplification and wild-type p53, and one mesothelioma cell line harboring a p53 point mutation. Nutlin-3 treatment increased expression of cyclin D1, MDM2, and p53 in cell lines with wild-type p53. Additive effects were observed in cells containing wild-type p53 through coordinated attack on MDM2-p53 binding and cyclin D1 by lentivirual shRNA knockdown or small molecule inhibition, as demonstrated by immunoblots and cell viability analyses. Further results demonstrate that MDM2 binds to cyclin D1, and that an increase in cyclin D1 expression after Nutlin-3 treatment is correlated with expression and ubiquitin E3-ligase activity of MDM2. MDM2 and p53 knockdown experiments demonstrated inhibition of cyclin D1 by MDM2 but not p53. These results indicate that combination inhibition of cyclin D1 and MDM2-p53 binding warrants clinical evaluation as a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer cells harboring wild-type p53.	0
Stabilization of mutant p53 via alkylation of cysteines and effects on DNA binding. || Alkylation Cysteine DNA Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Mass Spectrometry Protein Binding Protein Stability Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Oncogenic mutations inactivate the tumor suppressor p53 by lowering its stability or by weakening its binding to DNA. Alkylating agents that reactivate mutant p53 are currently being explored for cancer therapy. We have discovered ligands containing an α,β-unsaturated double bond, characteristic of Michael acceptors, that bind covalently to generic cysteine sites in the p53 core domain. They raised the melting temperature of the core domain of wild-type p53 and the hotspot mutants R175H, Y220C, G245S, R249S, and R282 by up to 3°C. Analysis of the relative reactivity of the cysteines in p53 by mass spectrometry found that C124 and C141 react first, followed by C135, C182, and C277, and eventually C176 and C275. Post-translational modifications of cysteines are known to be involved in regulation of other transcription factors. Modification of C277, which sits on the DNA-binding surface, may, for example, play a role in regulating p53 activity in cells in response to environmental cues. We found that the modifications progressively reduced DNA-binding activity of full-length p53. In light of these results, it is likely that the anticancer activity of the alkylating drugs works via a nontranscriptional activity of p53.	0
Inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway suppresses viral growth through innate immunity. || Alphavirus Infections Animals Antiviral Agents Cercopithecus aethiops Chikungunya Fever Chikungunya virus HeLa Cells Humans Immunity, Innate Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 Pyrimidines Vero Cells || Searching for stimulators of the innate antiviral response is an appealing approach to develop novel therapeutics against viral infections. Here, we established a cell-based reporter assay to identify compounds stimulating expression of interferon-inducible antiviral genes. DD264 was selected out of 41,353 compounds for both its immuno-stimulatory and antiviral properties. While searching for its mode of action, we identified DD264 as an inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. This metabolic pathway was recently identified as a prime target of broad-spectrum antiviral molecules, but our data unraveled a yet unsuspected link with innate immunity. Indeed, we showed that DD264 or brequinar, a well-known inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both enhanced the expression of antiviral genes in human cells. Furthermore, antiviral activity of DD264 or brequinar was found strictly dependent on cellular gene transcription, nuclear export machinery, and required IRF1 transcription factor. In conclusion, the antiviral property of pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibitors is not a direct consequence of pyrimidine deprivation on the virus machinery, but rather involves the induction of cellular immune response.	0
Oncogenic NRAS has multiple effects on the malignant phenotype of human melanoma cells cultured in vitro. || Cell Adhesion Molecules Cell Line, Tumor Cyclin D1 Cyclins Cytoskeleton Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, ras Humans Melanoma Mutation Oncogene Protein p21(ras) Paxillin Phenotype Phosphoproteins Skin Neoplasms Vinculin || Activating mutations in the NRAS gene, which occur predominantly in codon 61 (Q61R, Q61K) are among the most common genetic events in malignant melanoma. NRAS protein with oncogenic codon 61 mutations may therefore be good therapeutic targets. In the present study, we used gene expression profiling as a method for global characterization of gene expression alterations that resulted from treatment of melanoma cells with siRNA specifically targeting NRAS(Q61R). Sixteen probe sets representing 15 unique genes were identified whose expression was significantly altered by siRNA against NRAS(Q61R) in 2 melanoma cell lines. The genes with altered expression are involved in several functions, including modulation of cell growth, invasion and migration. The results suggest that downregulation of cyclin E2 and cyclin D1 and also upregulation of the negative cell-cycle regulator HBP1 in NRAS(Q61R) knockdown cells contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation. Furthermore, suppression of oncogenic NRAS results in reduced migration and invasion, which is accompanied by downregulation of EphA2 (a receptor tyrosine kinase), uPAR (urokinase receptor) and cytoskeleton proteins such as leupaxin, paxillin and vinculin. These studies support the concept that suppression of oncogenic NRAS by siRNA can induce growth arrest and inhibit invasion of human melanoma cells by modulating the levels of these gene products.	0
TP53 mutations and protein immunopositivity may predict for poor outcome but also for trastuzumab benefit in patients with early breast cancer treated in the adjuvant setting. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological Biomarkers, Tumor Chemotherapy, Adjuvant Chi-Square Distribution Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Clinical Trials as Topic DNA Mutational Analysis Disease Progression Disease-Free Survival Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Greece Humans Immunohistochemistry Kaplan-Meier Estimate Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Mutation Patient Selection Phenotype Predictive Value of Tests Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Retrospective Studies Risk Factors Time Factors Trastuzumab Treatment Outcome Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || We investigated the impact of PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and p53 protein status on the outcome of patients who had been treated with adjuvant anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy within clinical trials in the pre- and post-trastuzumab era. TP53 and PIK3CA mutations were found in 380 (21.5%) and 458 (25.9%) cases, respectively, including 104 (5.9%) co-mutated tumors; p53 immunopositivity was observed in 848 tumors (53.5%). TP53 mutations (p < 0.001) and p53 protein positivity (p = 0.001) were more frequent in HER2-positive and triple negative (TNBC) tumors, while PIK3CA mutations were more frequent in Luminal A/B tumors (p < 0.001). TP53 mutation status and p53 protein expression but not PIK3CA mutation status interacted with trastuzumab treatment for disease-free survival; patients with tumors bearing TP53 mutations or immunopositive for p53 protein fared better when treated with trastuzumab, while among patients treated with trastuzumab those with the above characteristics fared best (interaction p = 0.017 for mutations; p = 0.015 for IHC). Upon multivariate analysis the above interactions remained significant in HER2-positive patients; in the entire cohort, TP53 mutations were unfavorable in patients with Luminal A/B (p = 0.003) and TNBC (p = 0.025); p53 immunopositivity was strongly favorable in patients treated with trastuzumab (p = 0.009). TP53 and PIK3CA mutation status was examined in 1766 paraffin tumor DNA samples with informative semiconductor sequencing results. Among these, 1585 cases were also informative for p53 protein status assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC; 10% positivity cut-off). TP53 mutations confer unfavorable prognosis in patients with Luminal A/B and TNBC tumors, while p53 immunopositivity may predict for trastuzumab benefit in the adjuvant setting.	4
A comprehensive study of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in the Iranian phenylketonuria patients. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. After thalassemia, PKU is considered as the most common autosomal recessive diseases in the Iranian population. Therefore, an efficient diagnostic strategy is required to identify disease-causing mutations in this population. Following our first report in 2003, here we presented a comprehensive study on the mutation spectrum of the PAH gene in the Iranian population. This study was performed on 280 unrelated chromosomes from 140 Iranian patients with classic PKU. All 13 exons as well as exon-intron boundaries of the PAH gene were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. Thirty four different mutations were identified by a mutation detection rate of 100%. IVS10-11G > A, p.P281L, R261Q, p.F39del and IVS11+1G > C were the most prevalent mutations with frequencies of 26.07%, 19.3%, 12.86%, 6.07 and 3.93%, respectively. All other mutations represented a relative frequency less than 3.5%. The data from this study provided a comprehensive spectrum of the PAH gene mutations which can facilitate carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of PKU disease in the Iranian population.	3
Gal-3 is stimulated by gain-of-function p53 mutations and modulates chemoresistance in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Carcinoma Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin Colony-Forming Units Assay Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Galectin 3 Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genetic Therapy Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Middle Aged Mutation RNA Interference Thyroid Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is an anti-apoptotic molecule of the beta-galactoside-binding lectin family. Gal-3 is down-regulated by wt-p53 and this repression is required for p53-induced apoptosis. Since poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTCs) and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs) frequently harbour p53 mutations, we asked whether Gal-3 expression and activity could be influenced by such mutations in these tumours. We found a positive correlation between Gal-3 expression and p53 mutation in human thyroids and in thyroid carcinoma cell lines (TCCLs) harbouring different p53 mutations. Gal-3 was over-expressed in most ATCs and TCCLs, especially those with the most frequently detected p53 mutation (p53(R273H)). Over-expression of p53(R273H) in two p53-null cells (SAOS-2 and SW-1736) as well as in two wt-p53-carrying TCCLs (TPC-1 and K1), stimulated Gal-3 expression, while interference with p53(R273H) endogenous expression in ARO cells down-regulated Gal-3 expression. Conversely, over-expression of wt-p53 in ARO cells restored the inhibitory effect on Gal-3 expression. ARO cells are highly resistant to apoptosis and express both p53 and Gal-3, which are increased upon cisplatin treatment. Interference with Gal-3 expression in these cells stimulated their chemosensitivity. In conclusion, gain-of-function p53 mutant acquires the de novo ability to stimulate Gal-3 expression and to increase chemoresistance in ATCs.	0
CtIP is required for DNA damage-dependent induction of P21. || Carrier Proteins Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 DNA Damage G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental Humans MCF-7 Cells Nuclear Proteins Promoter Regions, Genetic || DNA endonuclease CtIP is involved in both DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and transcriptional repression/activation. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, which is induced at transcription level in response to a variety of stresses, controls G₁/S transition. In this report, we found that CtIP bound to the P21 promoter, and this binding was enhanced in response to DNA damage. Concomitantly, ectopic expression of CtIP increased P21 promoter activity, and this increment was enhanced upon camptothecin treatment. Conversely, DNA damage failed to induce P21 gene expression in CtIP-deficient cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CtIP is required for DNA damage-induced P21 induction.	0
The mutation p.D313Y is associated with organ manifestation in Fabry disease. || Adolescent Adult Brain Child Fabry Disease Family Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Mutation Organ Specificity Phenotype Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease (FD) is a multisystem lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene. The clinical significance of the mutation p.D313Y is still under debate. Retrospective chart analysis of clinical (neurological, cardiac, renal, and ophthalmological), genetic, and biochemical (lyso-globotriaosylsphingosine, lyso-Gb3; enzyme activity) data was performed in all our patients carrying the p.D313Y mutation. Fourteen patients from 5 families (10 female, 4 male; age range 10-51) were included. Symptoms and organ manifestations compatible with FD could be identified in 10 patients. Cerebrovascular events occurred in 4 females. Seven patients reported pain or acroparaesthesia. Cornea verticillata was found in 1 patient, mild retinal vascular tortuosity in 5 patients. Lyso-Gb3 was elevated in 2 females with cerebrovascular involvement. Classical cardiac, renal or skin manifestations could not be identified. The mutation p.D313Y in the GLA gene may lead to organ manifestations and elevation of the Fabry-specific biomarker lyso-Gb3. Neurological symptoms (stroke and pain) and ocular manifestations seem to be the leading findings. Annual routine visits are recommended for patients carrying the p.D313Y mutation. Enzyme replacement therapy might be considered in symptomatic patients.	3
Incidence of the del35G/GJB2 mutation in Croatian newborns with hearing impairment. || Alleles Connexin 26 Connexins Croatia Deafness Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Humans Incidence Infant, Newborn Mutation Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous Sequence Deletion || The de135G mutation in the GJB2 gene is the most common cause of prelingual deafness. The mutation frequency has so far been estimated either by testing symptomatic children or adults, or by carrier testing of the general population. The purpose of our study was to establish the incidence of the del35G/GJB2 mutation in newborns with hearing impairment--in congenital deafness. Patients were identified through a neonatal screening program (performed on a regular basis in Croatia since 2002). Otoacoustic emission testing was performed on 3275 newborns, and allele-specific PCR was performed on newborns diagnosed with hearing impairment. Hearing impairment was found in 9 newborns, the frequency of congenital hearing impairment being 1/363; the del35G mutation was found in 3 of these 9 newborns. The established incidence of the mutation in the studied population of Croatian newborns with hearing impairment is 1/1091 (95CI: 1/372-1/3205). This particular approach to patient identification, based on exact clinical examination supplemented with molecular testing, allowed for complete diagnosis and precise estimation of the incidence of the mutation in cases of congenital deafness, which proved to be higher than previously reported in prelingual deafness. This finding has important implications in clinical evaluation and genetic counseling of patients and their families.	4
Genetic predictors of MEK dependence in non-small cell lung cancer. || Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Line, Tumor ErbB Receptors Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Humans Lung Neoplasms MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || Hyperactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is common in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations in BRAF, RAS, and upstream receptor tyrosine kinases. To characterize the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK dependence of lung cancers harboring BRAF kinase domain mutations, we screened a large panel of human lung cancer cell lines (n = 87) and tumors (n = 916) for BRAF mutations. We found that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells with both V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with those harboring mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, or ALK and ROS kinase fusions. Supporting its classification as a "driver" mutation in the cells in which it is expressed, MEK inhibition in (V600E)BRAF NSCLC cells led to substantial induction of apoptosis, comparable with that seen with EGFR kinase inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC models. Despite high basal ERK phosphorylation, EGFR mutant cells were uniformly resistant to MEK inhibition. Conversely, BRAF mutant cell lines were resistant to EGFR inhibition. These data, together with the nonoverlapping pattern of EGFR and BRAF mutations in human lung cancer, suggest that these lesions define distinct clinical entities whose treatment should be guided by prospective real-time genotyping. To facilitate such an effort, we developed a mass spectrometry-based genotyping method for the detection of hotspot mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR. Using this assay, we confirmed that BRAF mutations can be identified in a minority of NSCLC tumors and that patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations have a distinct clinical profile compared with those whose tumors harbor kinase domain mutations in EGFR.	0
A stapled p53 helix overcomes HDMX-mediated suppression of p53. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Binding Sites Binding, Competitive Cell Line, Tumor Humans Mice Mice, Inbred NOD Nuclear Proteins Protein Engineering Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cancer cells neutralize p53 by deletion, mutation, proteasomal degradation, or sequestration to achieve a pathologic survival advantage. Targeting the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2 can lead to a therapeutic surge in p53 levels. However, the efficacy of HDM2 inhibition can be compromised by overexpression of HDMX, an HDM2 homolog that binds and sequesters p53. Here, we report that a stapled p53 helix preferentially targets HDMX, blocks the formation of inhibitory p53-HDMX complexes, induces p53-dependent transcriptional upregulation, and thereby overcomes HDMX-mediated cancer resistance in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, our analysis of p53 interaction dynamics provides a blueprint for reactivating the p53 pathway in cancer by matching HDM2, HDMX, or dual inhibitors to the appropriate cellular context.	0
Meta-analysis of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) rs2228671 polymorphism and coronary heart disease. || Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Case-Control Studies Cholesterol, LDL Coronary Disease Female Gene Frequency Genotype Humans Male Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Receptors, LDL || Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) can regulate cholesterol metabolism by removing the excess low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in blood. Since cholesterol metabolism is often disrupted in coronary heart disease (CHD), LDLR as a candidate gene of CHD has been intensively studied. The goal of our study is to evaluate the overall contribution of LDLR rs2228671 polymorphism to the risk of CHD by combining the genotyping data from multiple case-control studies. Our meta-analysis is involved with 8 case-control studies among 7588 cases and 9711 controls to test the association between LDLR rs2228671 polymorphism and CHD. In addition, we performed a case-control study of LDLR rs2228671 polymorphism with the risk of CHD in Chinese population. Our meta-analysis showed that rs2228671-T allele was significantly associated with a reduced risk of CHD (P = 0.0005, odds ratio (OR) = 0.83, and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.75-0.92). However, rs2228671-T allele frequency was rare (1%) and was not associated with CHD in Han Chinese (P = 0.49), suggesting an ethnic difference of LDLR rs2228671 polymorphism. Meta-analysis has established rs2228671 as a protective factor of CHD in Europeans. The lack of association in Chinese reflects an ethnic difference of this genetic variant between Chinese and European populations.	4
Clinical features, spectrum of causal genetic mutations and outcome of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in South Africans. || Adult Aged Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Carrier Proteins DNA Mutational Analysis Echocardiography Electrocardiography Female Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Phenotype Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Prospective Studies Risk Factors South Africa Time Factors || Little is known about the clinical characteristics, spectrum of causal genetic mutations and outcome of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Africans. The objective of this study was to delineate the clinical and genetic features and outcome of HCM in African patients. Information on clinical presentation, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings, and outcome of cases with HCM was collected from the Cardiac Clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital over a mean duration of follow up of 9.1 ± 3.4 years. Genomic DNA was screened for mutations in 15 genes that cause HCM, i.e. cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), cardiac β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), cardiac troponin T2 (TNNT2), cardiac troponin I (TNNI3), regulatory light chain of myosin (MYL2), essential light chain of myosin (MYL3), tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), phospholamban (PLN), α-actin (ACTC1), cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), AMP-activated protein kinase (PRKAG2), α-galactosidase (GLA), four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 (FHL1), lamin A/C (LMNA) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Survival and its predictors were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression methods, respectively. Forty-three consecutive patients [mean age 38.5 ± 14.3 years; 25 (58.1%) male; and 13 (30.2%) black African] were prospectively enrolled in the study from January 1996 to December 2012. Clinical presentation was similar to that reported in other studies. The South African founder mutations that cause HCM were not found in the 42 probands. Ten of 35 index cases (28.6%) tested for mutations in 15 genes had disease-causing mutations in MYH7 (six cases or 60%) and MYBPC3 (four cases or 40%). No disease-causing mutation was found in the other 13 genes screened. The annual mortality rate was 2.9% per annum and overall survival was 74% at 10 years, which was similar to the general South African population. Cox's proportional hazards regression showed that survival was predicted by New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at last visit (p equals; 0.026), but not by the presence of a disease-causing mutation (p = 0.474). Comprehensive genetic screening was associated with a 29% yield of causal genetic mutations in South African HCM cases, all in MYH7 and MBPC3 genes. A quarter of the patients had died after a decade of follow up, with NYHA functional class serving as a predictor of survival.	4
Identification of LDH-A as a therapeutic target for cancer cell killing via (i) p53/NAD(H)-dependent and (ii) p53-independent pathways. ||  || Most cancer cells use aerobic glycolysis to fuel their growth. The enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) is key to cancer's glycolytic phenotype, catalysing the regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) necessary to sustain glycolysis. As such, LDH-A is a promising target for anticancer therapy. Here we ask if the tumour suppressor p53, a major regulator of cellular metabolism, influences the response of cancer cells to LDH-A suppression. LDH-A knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) induced cancer cell death in p53 wild-type, mutant and p53-null human cancer cell lines, indicating that endogenous LDH-A promotes cancer cell survival irrespective of cancer cell p53 status. Unexpectedly, however, we uncovered a novel role for p53 in the regulation of cancer cell NAD(+) and its reduced form NADH. Thus, LDH-A silencing by RNAi, or its inhibition using a small-molecule inhibitor, resulted in a p53-dependent increase in the cancer cell ratio of NADH:NAD(+). This effect was specific for p53(+/+) cancer cells and correlated with (i) reduced activity of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and (ii) an increase in acetylated p53, a known target of SIRT1 deacetylation activity. In addition, activation of the redox-sensitive anticancer drug EO9 was enhanced selectively in p53(+/+) cancer cells, attributable to increased activity of NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase NQO1 (NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1). Suppressing LDH-A increased EO9-induced DNA damage in p53(+/+) cancer cells, but importantly had no additive effect in non-cancer cells. Our results identify a unique strategy by which the NADH/NAD(+) cellular redox status can be modulated in a cancer-specific, p53-dependent manner and we show that this can impact upon the activity of important NAD(H)-dependent enzymes. To summarise, this work indicates two distinct mechanisms by which suppressing LDH-A could potentially be used to kill cancer cells selectively, (i) through induction of apoptosis, irrespective of cancer cell p53 status and (ii) as a part of a combinatorial approach with redox-sensitive anticancer drugs via a novel p53/NAD(H)-dependent mechanism.	0
Analysis of the effect of tetrahydrobiopterin on PAH gene expression in hepatoma cells. || Biopterin Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Line, Tumor Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mutation, Missense Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias RNA, Messenger Transcription, Genetic || Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is a recently recognized variant of phenylketonuria, with a probable multifactorial molecular basis. In this study we have investigated the effect of BH4 on PAH gene expression in human hepatoma. Our results show that increased BH4 levels result in an enhancement of PAH activity and PAH protein, due to longer turnover rates, while PAH mRNA levels remain unchanged. This was confirmed for mutant PAH proteins (A309V, V388M and Y414C) associated to in vivo BH4 responsiveness, validating previous studies. We can conclude that there is no effect of the cofactor on PAH gene transcription, probably being the chemical chaperone effect of BH4 stabilizing mutant PAH proteins the major underlying mechanism of the response.	0

Human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase: functional characterization of the glycosylation sites. || Animals Base Sequence Biological Transport Cell Compartmentation Cells, Cultured DNA Mutational Analysis Glycosylation Humans Immunohistochemistry Lysosomes Molecular Sequence Data Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Phosphorylation Protein Processing, Post-Translational Recombinant Proteins Transcription, Genetic alpha-Glucosidases || N-linked glycosylation is one of the important events in the post-translational modification of human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. Phosphorylation of mannose residues ensures efficient transport of the enzyme to the lysosomes via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The primary structure of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase, as deduced from the cDNA sequence, indicates that there are seven potential glycosylation sites. We have eliminated these sites individually by site-directed mutagenesis and thereby demonstrated that all seven sites are glycosylated. The sites at Asn-882 and Asn-925 were found to be located in a C-terminal propeptide which is cleaved off during maturation. Evidence is presented that at least two of the oligosaccharide side chains of human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase are phosphorylated. Elimination of six of the seven sites does not disturb enzyme synthesis or function. However, removal of the second glycosylation site at Asn-233 interferes dramatically with the formation of mature enzyme. The mutant precursor is synthesized normally and assembles in the endoplasmic reticulum, but immunoelectron microscopy reveals a deficiency of alpha-glucosidase in the Golgi complex and in the more distal compartments of the lysosomal transport pathway.	0
[Universal method for single nucleotide substitution identification]. || Alleles DNA Primers Electrophoresis, Agar Gel Humans Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || A new approach to the identification of point mutations by allele-specific PCR was proposed. The mutation R408W of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene was used as a model. A high specificity of the approach was achieved by the use of primers partially complementary to the genomic DNA. Polyethylene glycol covalently attached to one of the allele-specific primers provides for the differential identification of the PCR products due to a change in electrophoretic mobility.	3
BRAF-V600E expression in primary nodular melanoma is associated with aggressive tumour features and reduced survival. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Immunoenzyme Techniques Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Skin Neoplasms Survival Rate Tissue Array Analysis Young Adult || Around 50% of primary melanomas harbour BRAF mutations, but their prognostic impact has not been clear. Recently, a BRAF-V600E mutation-specific antibody has become available for immunohistochemistry. Here, we investigated for the first time the prognostic impact of BRAF-V600E protein expression in primary melanoma. In a patient series of 248 nodular melanomas, BRAF-V600E and total BRAF expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray sections of paraffin-embedded archival tissue. Mutation status was assessed by real-time PCR in cases with sufficient tumour tissue (n=191). Positive BRAF-V600E expression was present in 86 (35%) of the cases, and was significantly associated with increased tumour thickness, presence of tumour ulceration and reduced survival. Further, BRAF-V600E expression was an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis, whereas BRAF mutation status was not significant. There was 88% concordance between BRAF-V600E expression and mutation status. Our findings indicate that BRAF-V600E expression is a novel prognostic marker in primary melanoma.	4
Next-generation sequencing of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancers in patients harboring epidermal growth factor-activating mutations. || Adenocarcinoma Aged Antineoplastic Agents Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors || The aim of this study was to detect the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations and other oncogene alterations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) who experienced a treatment failure in response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with a next generation sequencer. Fifteen patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with EGFR-TKIs were examined between August 2005 and October 2014. For each case, new biopsies were performed, followed by DNA sequencing on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) system using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel version 2. All 15 patients were diagnosed with NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations (seven cases of exon 19 deletion, seven cases of L858R in exon 21, and one case of L861Q in exon 21). Of the 15 cases, acquired T790M resistance mutations were detected in 9 (60.0%) patients. In addition, other mutations were identified outside of EGFR, including 13 cases (86.7%) exhibiting TP53 P72R mutations, 5 cases (33.3%) of KDR Q472H, and 2 cases (13.3%) of KIT M541L. Here, we showed that next-generation sequencing (NGS) is able to detect EGFR T790M mutations in cases not readily diagnosed by other conventional methods. Significant differences in the degree of EGFR T790M and other EGFR-activating mutations may be indicative of the heterogeneity of disease phenotype evident within these patients. The co-existence of known oncogenic mutations within each of these patients may play a role in acquired EGFR-TKIs resistance, suggesting the need for alternative treatment strategies, with PCR-based NGS playing an important role in disease diagnosis.	4
Hydrogen Bond Dynamic Propensity Studies for Protein Binding and Drug Design. || Drug Design Hydrogen Bonding Imidazoles Models, Molecular Piperazines Protein Binding Protein Conformation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We study the dynamic propensity of the backbone hydrogen bonds of the protein MDM2 (the natural regulator of the tumor suppressor p53) in order to determine its binding properties. This approach is fostered by the observation that certain backbone hydrogen bonds at the p53-binding site exhibit a dynamical propensity in simulations that differs markedly form their state-value (that is, formed/not formed) in the PDB structure of the apo protein. To this end, we conduct a series of hydrogen bond propensity calculations in different contexts: 1) computational alanine-scanning studies of the MDM2-p53 interface; 2) the formation of the complex of MDM2 with the disruptive small molecule Nutlin-3a (dissecting the contribution of the different molecular fragments) and 3) the binding of a series of small molecules (drugs) with different affinities for MDM2. Thus, the relevance of the hydrogen bond propensity analysis for protein binding studies and as a useful tool to complement existing methods for drug design and optimization will be made evident.	0
Exome analysis of carotid body tumor. ||  || Carotid body tumor (CBT) is a form of head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) arising at the bifurcation of carotid arteries. Paragangliomas are commonly associated with germline and somatic mutations involving at least one of more than thirty causative genes. However, the specific functionality of a number of these genes involved in the formation of paragangliomas has not yet been fully investigated. Exome library preparation was carried out using Nextera® Rapid Capture Exome Kit (Illumina, USA). Sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 System (Illumina). Exome analysis of 52 CBTs revealed potential driver mutations (PDMs) in 21 genes: ARNT, BAP1, BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, CSDE1, FGFR3, IDH1, KIF1B, KMT2D, MEN1, RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SETD2, TP53BP1, TP53BP2, and TP53I13. In many samples, more than one PDM was identified. There are also 41% of samples in which we did not identify any PDM; in these cases, the formation of CBT was probably caused by the cumulative effect of several not highly pathogenic mutations. Estimation of average mutation load demonstrated 6-8 mutations per megabase (Mb). Genes with the highest mutation rate were identified. Exome analysis of 52 CBTs for the first time revealed the average mutation load for these tumors and also identified potential driver mutations as well as their frequencies and co-occurrence with the other PDMs.	4
[Genetic screening for hearing disorders in newborn infants in combination with audiological screening]. ||  || Congenital deafness has the heterogeneous nature and can be underlain by both acquired and genetically determined causes. It has been estimated that the prevalence of clinically manifest forms of congenital deafness amounts to 1 case per 700 births. Half of these patients present with the deafness of genetic origin. One of the most common forms of congenital deafness is the hereditary one associated with mutations of the GJB2 gene. The most frequent mutation documented in this country is 35delG leading to congenital and prelingual bilateral deafness in 52% of the cases. The number of carriers of the 35delG mutation among healthy populations in the majority of regions of the Russian Federation is estimated at 2-4%. At present, identification of a child with bilateral loss of hearing in the course of detailed audiological screening dictates the necessity of genetic testing. It is believed that combined audiological and molecular genetic screening may be helpful for the early detection of children with a pathological genotype including those with only slightly manifest hearing loss at birth. Families having such a child should be in due time counseled about the risk of giving life to another child with the above disorder by the same couple or other relatives of the childbearing age.	4
Mutations in conserved regions 1, 2, and 3 of Raf-1 that activate transforming activity. || Alleles Amino Acid Sequence Amino Acid Substitution Animals Cell Line Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Conserved Sequence Fibroblasts Genes, ras MAP Kinase Signaling System Microscopy, Phase-Contrast Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Rats Recombinant Proteins || To investigate the role of Raf-1 in v-Ha-ras transformation, we have isolated and characterized a number of Raf-1 mutants that display increased transforming activity in Rat2 fibroblasts. A dipeptide deletion (Delta144-145) in the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of conserved region (CR) 1 increased the interaction between Raf-1 and v-Ha-ras effector loop mutants in the yeast two-hybrid system, supporting the proposal that the CRD serves as a secondary ras-binding domain. Many activating mutations were located in CR2. Two representative CR2 mutants (Delta250-258 and S257L) displayed increased interaction with v-Ha-ras effector loop mutants and with mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1 in the two-hybrid system. One novel mutation in CR3 was recovered; G361S affected the third glycine of the GXGXXG protein kinase motif involved in ATP binding. Expression of G361S Raf-1 in Rat2 fibroblasts activated MEK and ERK. The CR1, CR2, and CR3 activating mutations, when combined in cis, cooperated in transforming Rat2 fibroblasts. Conversely, Raf-1 transforming activity was decreased when the S257L or G361S mutation was combined in cis with the R89E substitution, which disrupts ras-Raf interaction. This mutant analysis provides additional information about the distinct functions of individual Raf-1 regions and documents a novel genetic mechanism for activating an oncogenic kinase.	0
p53 Aggregates penetrate cells and induce the co-aggregation of intracellular p53. || Animals HeLa Cells Humans Mice Mutant Proteins NIH 3T3 Cells Pinocytosis Protein Binding Protein Transport Recombinant Proteins Solubility Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Prion diseases are unique pathologies in which the infectious particles are prions, a protein aggregate. The prion protein has many particular features, such as spontaneous aggregation, conformation transmission to other native PrP proteins and transmission from an individual to another. Protein aggregation is now frequently associated to many human diseases, for example Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or type 2 diabetes. A few proteins associated to these conformational diseases are part of a new category of proteins, called prionoids: proteins that share some, but not all, of the characteristics associated with prions. The p53 protein, a transcription factor that plays a major role in cancer, has recently been suggested to be a possible prionoid. The protein has been shown to accumulate in multiple cancer cell types, and its aggregation has also been reproduced in vitro by many independent groups. These observations suggest a role for p53 aggregates in cancer development. This study aims to test the «prion-like» features of p53. Our results show in vitro aggregation of the full length and N-terminally truncated protein (p53C), and penetration of these aggregates into cells. According to our findings, the aggregates enter cells using macropinocytosis, a non-specific pathway of entry. Lastly, we also show that once internalized by the cell, p53C aggregates can co-aggregate with endogenous p53 protein. Together, these findings suggest prion-like characteristics for p53 protein, based on the fact that p53 can spontaneously aggregate, these aggregates can penetrate cells and co-aggregate with cellular p53.	0
p63 steps into the limelight: crucial roles in the suppression of tumorigenesis and metastasis. || Animals Cell Transformation, Neoplastic DNA Damage DNA Repair Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Mice Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasms Protein Isoforms Stem Cells Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The role of p63 in cancer has been an area of intense debate and controversy. Is TP63 (which encodes p63) a tumour suppressor gene or an oncogene? This debate is partly due to the complexity of the gene. There are several p63 isoforms - some with tumour suppressive functions and others with oncogenic functions. In this Opinion article, we focus on the recent advances in understanding p63 biology and its roles in cancer. In this regard, we discuss the role of p63 in multiple stem cell compartments, ageing, in the response to DNA damage and in DNA repair. Finally, we highlight the importance of understanding the interactions between all three p53 family members and the potential impact of this knowledge on cancer therapy and regenerative medicine.	0

At present, genetic testing for cardiomyopathy uses targeted sequencing to simultaneously assess the coding regions of >50 genes. New genes are routinely added to panels to improve the diagnostic yield. With the anticipated $1000 genome, it is expected that genetic testing will shift toward comprehensive genome sequencing accompanied by targeted gene analysis. Therefore, we assessed the reliability of whole genome sequencing and targeted analysis to identify cardiomyopathy variants in 11 subjects with cardiomyopathy. Whole genome sequencing with an average of 37× coverage was combined with targeted analysis focused on 204 genes linked to cardiomyopathy. Genetic variants were scored using multiple prediction algorithms combined with frequency data from public databases. This pipeline yielded 1 to 14 potentially pathogenic variants per individual. Variants were further analyzed using clinical criteria and segregation analysis, where available. Three of 3 previously identified primary mutations were detected by this analysis. In 6 subjects for whom the primary mutation was previously unknown, we identified mutations that segregated with disease, had clinical correlates, and had additional pathological correlation to provide evidence for causality. For 2 subjects with previously known primary mutations, we identified additional variants that may act as modifiers of disease severity. In total, we identified the likely pathological mutation in 9 of 11 (82%) subjects. These pilot data demonstrate that ≈30 to 40× coverage whole genome sequencing combined with targeted analysis is feasible and sensitive to identify rare variants in cardiomyopathy-associated genes.	4

To determine mechanisms underlying growth promotion by LRH-1 in CRC, we undertook global expression profiling following siRNA-mediated LRH-1 knockdown in HCT116 cells, which require LRH-1 for growth and in HT29 cells, in which LRH-1 does not regulate growth. Interestingly, expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) was regulated by LRH-1 in HCT116 cells. p21 regulation was not observed in HT29 cells, where p53 is mutated. p53 dependence for the regulation of p21 by LRH-1 was confirmed by p53 knockdown with siRNA, while LRH-1-regulation of p21 was not evident in HCT116 cells where p53 had been deleted. We demonstrate that LRH-1-mediated p21 regulation in HCT116 cells does not involve altered p53 protein or phosphorylation, and we show that LRH-1 inhibits p53 recruitment to the p21 promoter, likely through a mechanism involving chromatin remodelling. Our study suggests an important role for LRH-1 in the growth of CRC cells that retain wild-type p53.	0
Genomic Alterations Observed in Colitis-Associated Cancers Are Distinct From Those Found in Sporadic Colorectal Cancers and Vary by Type of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. || Adult Aged Colitis, Ulcerative Colorectal Neoplasms Comparative Genomic Hybridization Crohn Disease Female Genes, myc Genomics Humans Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Male Middle Aged Mutation Young Adult || Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC. We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of >300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations. We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and 18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC. In an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant differences in the spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic CRCs. We observed a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but not UC, as well as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic alterations observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.	4
p53 binds the mdmx mRNA and controls its translation. || Animals Humans Mice Nuclear Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 RNA, Messenger Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || MDMX and MDM2 are two nonredundant essential regulators of p53 tumor suppressor activity. MDM2 controls p53 expression levels, whereas MDMX is predominantly a negative regulator of p53 trans-activity. The feedback loops between MDM2 and p53 are well studied and involve both negative and positive regulation on transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels but little is known on the regulatory pathways between p53 and MDMX. Here we show that overexpression of p53 suppresses mdmx mRNA translation in vitro and in cell-based assays. The core domain of p53 binds the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the mdmx mRNA in a zinc-dependent manner that together with a trans-suppression domain located in p53 N-terminus controls MDMX synthesis. This interaction can be visualized in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment. Fusion of the mdmx 5'UTR to the ovalbumin open reading frame leads to suppression of ovalbumin synthesis. Interestingly, the transcription inactive p53 mutant R273H has a different RNA-binding profile compared with the wild-type p53 and differentiates the synthesis of MDMX isoforms. This study describes p53 as a trans-suppressor of the mdmx mRNA and adds a further level to the intricate feedback system that exist between p53 and its key regulatory factors and emphasizes the important role of mRNA translation control in regulating protein expression in the p53 pathway.	0
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 mutation in nonsyndromic coronal synostosis: clinical spectrum, prevalence, and surgical outcome. || Arginine Chi-Square Distribution Child Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses DNA Female Fibroblast Growth Factors Fingers Follow-Up Studies Frontal Bone Humans Hypertelorism Intelligence Male Parietal Bone Phenotype Point Mutation Prevalence Proline Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor Sex Factors Skull Temporal Bone Treatment Outcome || A recurrent point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene that converts proline 250 into arginine has been reported recently in cases of apparently nonsyndromic coronal craniosynostosis. The goal of the present study was to examine the phenotype of patients in whom this mutation was present, to determine the prevalence of the condition, and to assess the functional and the morphological outcome of the surgically treated patients. A DNA analysis was performed in 103 children suffering from apparently isolated coronal synostosis, 41 of whom had bilateral and 62 of whom had unilateral disease. There were 31 boys and 72 girls in the study group. Sixty cases were sporadic and 43 were familial; the 43 familial cases arose in 33 unrelated families. The mutation was found in seven (12%) of 60 sporadic cases and in 24 (73%) of the 33 families. The functional and morphological results were assessed in all surgically treated patients who had at least 1 year of follow up and who were at least 3 years of age at the time of assessment. A comparison was made between patients with the mutation and those without. The most typical presentation was seen in girls and consisted of a bicoronal synostosis resulting in a severe brachycephaly associated with mild hypertelorism and marked bulging of the temporal fossae, which resulted in a huge enlargement of the upper part of the face. The most frequently associated extracranial anomaly was brachydactyly, identified either clinically or radiologically. Based on the proportion of bilateral and unilateral coronal synostoses, the present data indicate that the mutation is associated with more severe cases and that girls with the mutation are more severely affected than boys. The functional and morphological results were worse in patients in whom the mutation was present as compared with those in whom it was not.	4

It has a rare predilection to develop brain metastases (BM). In this study, we evaluated the mutational profile of ovarian cancer metastases through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) with the aim of identifying potential clinically actionable genetic alterations with options for small molecule targeted therapy. Library preparation was conducted using Illumina TruSight Rapid Capture Kit in combination with a cancer specific enrichment kit covering 94 genes. BRCA-mutations were confirmed by using TruSeq Custom Amplicon Low Input Kit in combination with a custom-designed BRCA gene panel. In our cohort all eight sequenced BM samples exhibited a multitude of variant alterations, each with unique molecular profiles. The 37 identified variants were distributed over 22 cancer-related genes (23.4%). The number of mutated genes per sample ranged from 3 to 7 with a median of 4.5. The most commonly altered genes were BRCA1/2, TP53, and ATM. In total, 7 out of 8 samples revealed either a BRCA1 or a BRCA2 pathogenic mutation. Furthermore, all eight BM samples showed mutations in at least one DNA repair gene. Our NGS study of BM of ovarian carcinoma revealed a significant number of BRCA-mutations beside TP53, ATM and CHEK2 mutations. These findings strongly suggest the implication of BRCA and DNA repair malfunction in ovarian cancer metastasizing to the brain. Based on these findings, pharmacological PARP inhibition could be one potential targeted therapeutic for brain metastatic ovarian cancer patients.	4
PIK3CA mutation H1047R is associated with response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway inhibitors in early-phase clinical trials. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Clinical Trials as Topic Disease-Free Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Polymerase Chain Reaction Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Retrospective Studies Signal Transduction TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases Young Adult || PIK3CA mutations may predict response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers, but the relevance of mutation subtype has not been investigated. Patients with diverse cancers referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy were analyzed for PIK3CA and, if possible, KRAS mutations. Patients with PIK3CA mutations were treated, whenever possible, with agents targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Overall, 105 (10%) of 1,012 patients tested harbored PIK3CA mutations. Sixty-six (median 3 prior therapies) of the 105 PIK3CA-mutant patients, including 16 individuals (of 55 PIK3CA-mutant patients tested) with simultaneous KRAS mutations, were treated on a protocol that included a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor; 17% (11/66) achieved a partial response (PR). Patients with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation compared with patients who had other PIK3CA mutations or patients with wild-type PIK3CA treated on the same protocols had a higher PR rate (6/16, 38% vs. 5/50; 10% vs. 23/174, 13%, respectively; all P ≤ 0.02). None of the 16 patients with coexisting PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13 attained a PR (0/16, 0%). Patients treated with combination therapy versus single-agent therapies had a higher PR rate (11/38, 29% vs. 0/28, 0%; P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that H1047R was the only independent factor predicting response [OR 6.6, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-43.0, P = 0.047). Our data suggest that interaction between PIK3CA mutation H1047R versus other aberrations and response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis inhibitors warrants further exploration.	4
Identification and characterization of CDH1 germline variants in sporadic gastric cancer patients and in individuals at risk of gastric cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alternative Splicing Antigens, CD Base Sequence Cadherins Cell Line DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Immunohistochemistry Introns Male Middle Aged Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Risk Factors Stomach Neoplasms Young Adult beta Catenin || To screen and characterize germline variants for E-cadherin (CDH1) in non-hereditary gastric cancer (GC) patients and in subjects at risk of GC. 59 GCs, 59 first degree relatives (FDRs) of GC, 20 autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis (AMAGs) and 52 blood donors (BDs) were analyzed for CDH1 by direct sequencing, structural modelling and bioinformatics. Functional impact on splicing was assessed for intronic mutations. E-cadherin/β-catenin immunohistochemical staining and E-cadherin mRNA quantification using RT-PCR were performed. In GCs, 4 missense variants (p.G274S; p.A298T; p.T470I; p.A592T), 1 mutation in the 5'UTR (-71C>G) and 1 mutation in the intronic IVS12 (c.1937-13T>C) region were found. First pathogenic effect of p.A298T mutation was predicted by protein 3D modelling. The novel p.G274S mutation showed a no clear functional significance. Moreover, first, intronic IVS12 (c.1937-13T>C) mutation was demonstrated to lead to an aberrant CDH1 transcript with exon 11 deletion. This mutation was found in 2 GCs and in 1 BD. In FDRs, we identified 4 variants: the polymorphic (p.A592T) and 3 mutations in untranslated regions with unidentified functional role except for the 5'UTR (-54G>C) that had been found to decrease CDH1 transcription. In AMAGs, we detected 2 alterations: 1 missense (p.A592T) and 1 novel variant (IVS1 (c.48+7C>T)) without effect on CDH1 splicing. Several silent and polymorphic substitutions were found in all the groups studied. Overall our study improves upon the current characterization of CDH1 mutations and their functional role in GC and in individuals at risk of GC. Mutations found in untranslated regions and data on splicing effects deserve a particular attention like associated with a reduced E-cadherin amount. The utility of CDH1 screening, in addition to the identification of other risk factors, could be useful for the early detection of GC in subjects at risk (i.e. FDRs and AMAGs), and warrants further study.	4
ΔNp63α activates CD82 metastasis suppressor to inhibit cancer cell invasion. || Gene Knockdown Techniques Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta Humans Kangai-1 Protein Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasms Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins || P63 is a p53 family member involved in multiple facets of biology, including embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, senescence and aging. The p63 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms either with (TAp63) or without (ΔNp63) the N-terminal transactivation domain. Amounting evidence suggests that p63 can function as a tumor suppressor, yet the precise molecular mechanisms, and particularly the specific roles of TAp63 and ΔNp63 in cancer progression, are still largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that ΔNp63α, the predominant isoform expressed in epithelial cells and squamous cell carcinomas, inhibits cell invasion. Affymetrix gene expression profiling, combined with gain- and loss-of-function analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation, indicated that cluster of differentiation 82 (CD82), a documented metastasis suppressor, is a direct transcriptional target of ΔNp63α. Expression of ΔNp63α inhibited outgrowth in Matrigel and cancer cell invasion, which was largely reversed by specific ablation of CD82. Conversely, ΔNp63α knockdown led to increased cell invasion, which was reversed by ectopic expression of CD82. Moreover, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) by either pharmacological inhibitors or by RNA interference resulted in the downregulation of ΔNp63α and CD82 expression, concomitant with increased cell invasion, independently of β-catenin. Furthermore, decreased expression of p63 and CD82 is correlated with cancer progression. Taken together, this study reveals that ΔNp63α upregulates CD82 to inhibit cell invasion, and suggests that GSK3β can regulate cell invasion by modulating the ΔNp63α-CD82 axis.	0
Rare diseases, rare presentations: recognizing atypical inherited kidney disease phenotypes in the age of genomics. ||  || A significant percentage of adults (10%) and children (20%) on renal replacement therapy have an inherited kidney disease (IKD). The new genomic era, ushered in by the next generation sequencing techniques, has contributed to the identification of new genes and facilitated the genetic diagnosis of the highly heterogeneous IKDs. Consequently, it has also allowed the reclassification of diseases and has broadened the phenotypic spectrum of many classical IKDs. Various genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors may explain 'atypical' phenotypes. In this article, we examine different mechanisms that may contribute to phenotypic variability and also provide case examples that illustrate them. The aim of the article is to raise awareness, among nephrologists and geneticists, of rare presentations that IKDs may show, to facilitate diagnosis.	4
Limited mutational heterogeneity in the LDLR gene in familial hypercholesterolemia in Tunisia. || Adolescent Adult Aged DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Family Health Female Heterozygote Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Mutation Pedigree Polymorphism, Genetic Receptors, LDL Tunisia || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) genes. In previous studies, we have identified novel mutations in Tunisian FH families. In this study, we have extended our investigation to additional families. Five unrelated probands were screened for mutations in the LDLR and APOB genes, using direct sequencing and enzymatic restriction. We identified two novel LDLR mutations: a missense mutation in exon 7: p.Gly343Cys (c.1027G>T), and a nonsense mutation in exon 17: p.Lys816X (c.2446A>T). Using the PolyPhen and SIFT prediction computer programs the p.Gly343Cys is predicted to have a deleterious effect on LDL receptor activity. The missense mutation we found in exon 3, p.Cys89Trp (c.267C>G), has previously been identified in patients from United Kingdom and Spain, and is reported here for the first time in the Tunisian population. Finally, the framshift mutation in exon 10, p.Ser493ArgfsX44, is reported here for the fourth and fifth time in Tunisian families. The latter is the most frequent FH-causing mutation in Tunisia. These LDLR gene mutations enrich the spectrum of mutations causing FH in the Tunisian population. The framshift mutation, p.Ser493ArgfsX44, seems to be a founder mutation in this population.	4
A review of treatment of Pompe disease in infants. ||  || The glycogen storage disease type II (GSD-II), or Pompe disease, is due to the deficit of lysosomal glycogen degradation enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). In infants, Pompe disease is characterized by prominent hypotonia, muscle weakness, motor delay, feeding problems, and respiratory and cardiac insufficiency. In a retrospective study, the median age at death was 8.7 months. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA is recently used to treat patients with Pompe disease, and has been shown to prolong survival, reverse cardiomyopathy, and improve motor function. This article briefly reviews the history and manifestations of Pompe disease, and then focuses on the development of the drug for Pompe disease, alglucosidase alfa. Current status of treatment and future developments are also discussed.	1
Mertensene, a Halogenated Monoterpene, Induces G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest and Caspase Dependent Apoptosis of Human Colon Adenocarcinoma HT29 Cell Line through the Modulation of ERK-1/-2, AKT and NF-κB Signaling. || Adenocarcinoma Apoptosis Caspases Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Colonic Neoplasms Cyclin-Dependent Kinases G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints HT29 Cells Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Monoterpenes NF-kappa B Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction || Conventional treatment of advanced colorectal cancer is associated with tumor resistance and toxicity towards normal tissues. Therefore, development of effective anticancer therapeutic alternatives is still urgently required. Nowadays, marine secondary metabolites have been extensively investigated due to the fact that they frequently exhibit anti-tumor properties. However, little attention has been given to terpenoids isolated from seaweeds. In this study, we isolated the halogenated monoterpene mertensene from the red alga Pterocladiella capillacea (S.G. Gmelin) Santelices and Hommersand and we highlight its inhibitory effect on the viability of two human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines HT29 and LS174. Interestingly, exposure of HT29 cells to different concentrations of mertensene correlated with the activation of MAPK ERK-1/-2, Akt and NF-κB pathways. Moreover, mertensene-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest was associated with a decrease in the phosphorylated forms of the anti-tumor transcription factorp53, retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cdc2 and chkp2. Indeed, a reduction of the cellular level of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2 and CDK4 was observed in mertensene-treated cells. We also demonstrated that mertensene triggers a caspase-dependent apoptosis in HT29 cancer cells characterized by the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Besides, the level of death receptor-associated protein TRADD increased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of mertensene as a drug candidate for the treatment of colon cancer.	0

RIT1 controls actin dynamics via complex formation with RAC1/CDC42 and PAK1. || Actins Animals COS Cells Cell Movement Cercopithecus aethiops Cytoskeleton HEK293 Cells Humans Multiprotein Complexes Mutation Protein Binding cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein p21-Activated Kinases rac1 GTP-Binding Protein ras Proteins || RIT1 belongs to the RAS family of small GTPases. Germline and somatic RIT1 mutations have been identified in Noonan syndrome (NS) and cancer, respectively. By using heterologous expression systems and purified recombinant proteins, we identified the p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) as novel direct effector of RIT1. We found RIT1 also to directly interact with the RHO GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, both of which are crucial regulators of actin dynamics upstream of PAK1. These interactions are independent of the guanine nucleotide bound to RIT1. Disease-causing RIT1 mutations enhance protein-protein interaction between RIT1 and PAK1, CDC42 or RAC1 and uncouple complex formation from serum and growth factors. We show that the RIT1-PAK1 complex regulates cytoskeletal rearrangements as expression of wild-type RIT1 and its mutant forms resulted in dissolution of stress fibers and reduction of mature paxillin-containing focal adhesions in COS7 cells. This effect was prevented by co-expression of RIT1 with dominant-negative CDC42 or RAC1 and kinase-dead PAK1. By using a transwell migration assay, we show that RIT1 wildtype and the disease-associated variants enhance cell motility. Our work demonstrates a new function for RIT1 in controlling actin dynamics via acting in a signaling module containing PAK1 and RAC1/CDC42, and highlights defects in cell adhesion and migration as possible disease mechanism underlying NS.	0
p53 modulates homologous recombination at I-SceI-induced double-strand breaks through cell-cycle regulation. || Animals Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor Cercopithecus aethiops DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific G2 Phase Homologous Recombination Humans S Phase Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Inhibition of homologous recombination (HR) is believed to be a transactivation-independent function of p53 that protects from genetic instability. Misrepair by HR can lead to genetic alterations such as translocations, duplications, insertions and loss of heterozygosity, which all bear the risk of driving oncogenic transformation. Regulation of HR by wild-type p53 (wtp53) should prevent these genomic rearrangements. Mutation of p53 is a frequent event during carcinogenesis. In particular, dominant-negative mutants inhibiting wtp53 expressed from the unperturbed allel can drive oncogenic transformation by disrupting the p53-dependent anticancer barrier. Here, we asked whether the hot spot mutants R175H and R273H relax HR control in p53-proficient cells. Utilizing an I-SceI-based reporter assay, we observed a moderate (1.5 × ) stimulation of HR upon expression of the mutant proteins in p53-proficient CV-1, but not in p53-deficient H1299 cells. Importantly, the stimulatory effect was exactly paralleled by an increase in the number of HR competent S- and G2-phase cells, which can well explain the enhanced recombination frequencies. Furthermore, the impact on HR exerted by the transactivation domain double-mutant L22Q/W23S and mutant R273P, both of which were reported to regulate HR independently of G1-arrest execution, is also exactly mirrored by cell-cycle behavior. These results are in contrast to previous concepts stating that the transactivation-independent impact of p53 on HR is a general phenomenon valid for replication-associated and also for directly induced double-strand break. Our data strongly suggest that the latter is largely mediated by cell-cycle regulation, a classical transactivation-dependent function of p53.	0
Convergent patterns of association between phenylalanine hydroxylase variants and schizophrenia in four independent samples. || Alleles Case-Control Studies Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Linkage Disequilibrium Male Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Schizophrenia || Recessive mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene predispose to phenylketonuria (PKU) in conjunction with dietary exposure to phenylalanine. Previous studies have suggested PAH variations could confer risk for schizophrenia, but comprehensive follow-up has not been reported. We analyzed 15 common PAH "tag" SNPs and three exonic variations that are rare in Caucasians but common in African-Americans among four independent samples (total n = 5,414). The samples included two US Caucasian cohorts (260 trios, 230 independent cases, 474 controls), Bulgarian families (659 trios), and an African-American sample (464 families, 401 controls). Analyses of both US Caucasian samples revealed associations with five SNPs; most notably the common allele (G) of rs1522305 from case-control analyses (z = 2.99, P = 0.006). This SNP was independently replicated in the Bulgarian cohort (z = 2.39, P = 0.015). A non-significant trend was also observed among African-American families (z = 1.39, P = 0.165), and combined analyses of all four samples were significant (rs1522305: chi(2) = 23.28, 8 d.f., P = 0.003). Results for rs1522305 met our a priori criteria for statistical significance, namely an association that was robust to multiple testing correction in one sample, a replicated risk allele in multiple samples, and combined analyses that were nominally significant. Case-control results in African-Americans detected an association with L321L (P = 0.047, OR = 1.46). Our analyses suggest several associations at PAH, with consistent evidence for rs1522305. Further analyses, including additional variations and environmental influences such as phenylalanine exposure are warranted.	3
Level of RUNX1 activity is critical for leukemic predisposition but not for thrombocytopenia. || Cell Line Cells, Cultured Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit Gene Deletion Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genomic Instability Hematopoiesis Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Leukemia Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Mutation, Missense Thrombocytopenia || To explore how RUNX1 mutations predispose to leukemia, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 2 pedigrees with germline RUNX1 mutations. The first, carrying a missense R174Q mutation, which acts as a dominant-negative mutant, is associated with thrombocytopenia and leukemia, and the second, carrying a monoallelic gene deletion inducing a haploinsufficiency, presents only as thrombocytopenia. Hematopoietic differentiation of these iPSC clones demonstrated profound defects in erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis and deregulated expression of RUNX1 targets. iPSC clones from patients with the R174Q mutation specifically generated an increased amount of granulomonocytes, a phenotype reproduced by an 80% RUNX1 knockdown in the H9 human embryonic stem cell line, and a genomic instability. This phenotype, found only with a lower dosage of RUNX1, may account for development of leukemia in patients. Altogether, RUNX1 dosage could explain the differential phenotype according to RUNX1 mutations, with a haploinsufficiency leading to thrombocytopenia alone in a majority of cases whereas a more complete gene deletion predisposes to leukemia.	0
5-aza-2',2'-Difluoro Deoxycytidine (NUC013): A Novel Nucleoside DNA Methyl Transferase Inhibitor and Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor for the Treatment of Cancer. ||  || Tumor suppressor genes can be silenced genetically as well as epigenetically. One approach to reversing epigenetic suppression of tumor suppressor genes is to inhibit DNA methyl transferase. 5-aza-2',2'-diflurorodeoxycytidine (NUC013) is a novel DNA methyl transferase and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor that is a more potent inhibitor of growth than decitabine in the NCI 60 cancer cell line panel. NUC013 is more active than decitabine against p53-null/mutant cancer cell lines (p = 0.027) but is even more so against p53 wild-type (WT) cell lines (p = 0.0025). The maximum tolerated dose in mice of NUC013 is greater than 120 mg/kg administered intravenously for three consecutive days a week for three weeks. With this regimen and a dose of 20 mg/kg in a human leukemia HL-60 (p53-null) NCr-nu/nu mouse xenograft model (n = 10/group), NUC013 demonstrated a survival benefit (saline median survival (MS) = 26.5 days, NUC013 MS = 32 days and hazard ratio (HR) = 0.26 (p = 0.032)). In a colon cancer LoVo (TP53 WT) xenograft, mice treated with decitabine at 5 mg/kg had worse survival than saline controls (decitabine MS = 31 days, saline MS > 60 days and HR = 26.89 (p < 0.0001)). At a dose of 20 mg/kg NUC013, mean tumor volume in the LoVo xenografts was lower than controls by 50.9% and at 40 mg/kg by 53.7% (bothp < 0.0001).	0
Structure and Function of p53-DNA Complexes with Inactivation and Rescue Mutations: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study. || DNA Humans Molecular Docking Simulation Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Neoplasms Protein Binding Protein Conformation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumor suppressor protein p53 can lose its function upon DNA-contact mutations (R273C and R273H) in the core DNA-binding domain. The activity can be restored by second-site suppressor or rescue mutations (R273C_T284R, R273H_T284R, and R273H_S240R). In this paper, we elucidate the structural and functional consequence of p53 proteins upon DNA-contact mutations and rescue mutations and the underlying mechanisms at the atomic level by means of molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we also apply the docking approach to investigate the binding phenomena between the p53 protein and DNA upon DNA-contact mutations and rescue mutations. This study clearly illustrates that, due to DNA-contact mutants, the p53 structure loses its stability and becomes more rigid than the native protein. This structural loss might affect the p53-DNA interaction and leads to inhibition of the cancer suppression. Rescue mutants (R273C_T284R, R273H_T284R and R273H_S240R) can restore the functional activity of the p53 protein upon DNA-contact mutations and show a good interaction between the p53 protein and a DNA molecule, which may lead to reactivate the cancer suppression function. Understanding the effects of p53 cancer and rescue mutations at the molecular level will be helpful for designing drugs for p53 associated cancer diseases. These drugs should be designed so that they can help to inhibit the abnormal function of the p53 protein and to reactivate the p53 function (cell apoptosis) to treat human cancer.	0
Characterization of the oligomerization defects of two p53 mutants found in families with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome. || Arginine Circular Dichroism Cysteine Germ-Line Mutation Humans Leucine Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular Proline Protein Structure, Secondary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Recently two germline mutations in the oligomerization domain of p53 have been identified in patients with Li-Fraumeni and Li-Fraumeni-like Syndromes. We have used biophysical and biochemical methods to characterize these two mutants in order to better understand their functional defects and the role of the p53 oligomerization domain (residues 325-355) in oncogenesis. We find that residues 310-360 of the L344P mutant are monomeric, apparently unfolded and cannot interact with wild-type (WT) p53. The full length L344P protein is unable to bind sequence specifically to DNA and is therefore an inactive, but not a dominant negative mutant. R337C, on the other hand, can form dimers and tetramers, can hetero-oligomerize with WTp53 and can bind to a p53 consensus element. However, the thermal stability of R337C is much lower than that of WTp53 and at physiological temperatures more than half of this mutant is less than tetrameric. Thus, the R337C mutant retains some functional activity yet leads to a predisposition to cancer, suggesting that even partial inactivation of p53 oligomerization is sufficient for accelerated tumour progression.	0

Here TETs of advanced-stage patients enrolled in a clinical trial of molecularly-guided targeted therapies were employed for targeted sequencing of 197 cancer-associated genes. Comparative sequence analysis of 78 TET/blood paired samples obtained from 47 thymic carcinoma (TC) and 31 thymoma patients revealed a total of 86 somatic non-synonymous sequence variations across 39 different genes in 33 (42%) TETs. TCs (62%; 29/47) showed higher incidence of somatic non-synonymous mutations than thymomas (13%; 4/31; p < 0.0001). TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene in TETs (n = 13; 17%), especially in TCs (26%), and was associated with a poorer overall survival (p < 0.0001). Genes in histone modification [BAP1 (n = 6; 13%), SETD2 (n = 5; 11%), ASXL1 (n = 2; 4%)], chromatin remodeling [SMARCA4 (n = 2; 4%)], and DNA methylation [DNMT3A (n = 3; 7%), TET2 (n = 2; 4%), WT1 (n = 2; 4%)] pathways were recurrently mutated in TCs, but not in thymomas. Our results suggest a potential disruption of epigenetic homeostasis in TCs, and a substantial difference in genetic makeup between TCs and thymomas. Further investigation is warranted into the roles of epigenetic dysregulation in TC development and its potential for targeted therapy.	4

Reactivation of mutant p53 by small molecules is an exciting potential cancer therapy. Although several compounds restore wild-type function to mutant p53, their binding sites and mechanisms of action are elusive. Here computational methods identify a transiently open binding pocket between loop L1 and sheet S3 of the p53 core domain. Mutation of residue Cys124, located at the centre of the pocket, abolishes p53 reactivation of mutant R175H by PRIMA-1, a known reactivation compound. Ensemble-based virtual screening against this newly revealed pocket selects stictic acid as a potential p53 reactivation compound. In human osteosarcoma cells, stictic acid exhibits dose-dependent reactivation of p21 expression for mutant R175H more strongly than does PRIMA-1. These results indicate the L1/S3 pocket as a target for pharmaceutical reactivation of p53 mutants.	0
RAS mutations vary between lesions in synchronous primary colorectal cancer: testing only one lesion is not sufficient to guide anti-EGFR treatment decisions. ||  || Mutations in KRAS and NRAS genes are negative predictors of anti-EGFR therapies response in metastatic colorectal cancer. There are few reports on RAS testing in synchronous primary colorectal cancer (SP-CRC) and a lack of recommendations on which tissue should be tested for the mutation in this disease. This study analyzed the RAS status of both lesions in SP-CRC patients and in their metastasis. DNA was obtained from formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded tissue, and mutations were analyzed by pyrosequencing. RAS status was heterogeneous in 6 (75%) of 8 SP-CRC patients between primary lesions. Five showed heterogeneity regarding RAS mutational status, and from these, four presented with metastasis: 3 cases (75%) had WT metastatic tissue, and 1 case (25%) had mutated metastatic tissue. One patient showed divergence regarding RAS mutation type. RAS mutations vary significantly between SP-CRC lesions, and the status of the metastasis is unpredictable. Testing for RAS mutations in only 1 of the primary lesions can misguide clinical decisions and hind the predictive potential of anti-EGFR treatment. A more appropriate approach in metastatic SP-CRC is to test the metastatic tissue or both primary lesions for providing more accurate mutation scenery and support more assertive clinical decisions.	4
Assemblages: functional units formed by cellular phase separation. || Animals Biological Transport Cytoplasmic Structures Humans Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Nuclear Pore Phase Transition Protein Binding Protein Multimerization || The partitioning of intracellular space beyond membrane-bound organelles can be achieved with collections of proteins that are multivalent or contain low-complexity, intrinsically disordered regions. These proteins can undergo a physical phase change to form functional granules or other entities within the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm that collectively we term "assemblage." Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play an important role in forming a subset of cellular assemblages by promoting phase separation. Recent work points to an involvement of assemblages in disease states, indicating that intrinsic disorder and phase transitions should be considered in the development of therapeutics.	0
The role of p19 and p21 H-Ras proteins and mutants in miRNA expression in cancer and a Costello syndrome cell model. || Animals Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Cells, Cultured Costello Syndrome Embryo, Mammalian Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HeLa Cells Humans Mice MicroRNAs Models, Biological Mutant Proteins Neoplasms Protein Isoforms Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || P19 H-Ras, a second product derived from the H-Ras gene by alternative splicing, induces a G1/S phase delay, thereby maintaining cells in a reversible quiescence state. When P21 H-Ras is mutated in tumour cells, the alternative protein P19 H-Ras is also mutated. The H-Ras mutation Q61L is frequently detected in different tumours, which acts as constitutive activator of Ras functions and is considered to be a strong activating mutant. Additionally, a rare congenital disorder named Costello Syndrome, is described as a H-Ras disorder in children, mainly due to mutation G12S in p19 and p21 H-Ras proteins, which is present in 90 % of the Costello Syndrome patients. Our aim is to better understand the role of p19 and p21 H-Ras proteins in the cancer and Costello Syndrome development, concerning the miRNAs expression. Total miRNAs expression regulated by H-Ras proteins were first analyzed in human miRNA microarrays assays. Previously selected miRNAs, were further analyzed in developed cell lines containing H-Ras protein mutants, that included the G12S Costello Syndrome mutant, with PCR Real-Time Taq Man miRNA Assays primers. This study describes how p19 affects the RNA world and shows that: i) miR-342, miR-206, miR-330, miR-138 and miR-99b are upregulated by p19 but not by p19W164A mutant; ii) anti-miR-206 can restore the G2 phase in the presence of p19; iii) p19 and p21Q61L regulate their own alternative splicing; iv) miR-206 and miR-138 are differentially regulated by p19 and p21 H-Ras and v) P19G12S Costello mutants show a clear upregulation of miR-374, miR-126, miR-342, miR-330, miR-335 and let-7. These results allow us to conclude that the H-Ras G12S mutation plays an important role in miRNA expression and open up a new line of study to understand the consequences of this mutation on Costello syndrome. Furthermore, they suggest that oncogenes may have a sufficiently important impact on miRNA expression to promote the development of numerous cancers.	0
Concurrent versus sequential sorafenib therapy in combination with radiation for hepatocellular carcinoma. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Clinical Trials as Topic Combined Modality Therapy DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded Gamma Rays Gene Expression Hindlimb Histones Humans Liver Neoplasms Mice Mice, Nude Neovascularization, Pathologic Niacinamide Phenylurea Compounds Radiation Tolerance Sorafenib Tumor Burden Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Sorafenib (SOR) is the only systemic agent known to improve survival for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, SOR prolongs survival by less than 3 months and does not alter symptomatic progression. To improve outcomes, several phase I-II trials are currently examining SOR with radiation (RT) for HCC utilizing heterogeneous concurrent and sequential treatment regimens. Our study provides preclinical data characterizing the effects of concurrent versus sequential RT-SOR on HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Concurrent and sequential RT-SOR regimens were tested for efficacy among 4 HCC cell lines in vitro by assessment of clonogenic survival, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and γ-H2AX foci formation. Results were confirmed in vivo by evaluating tumor growth delay and performing immunofluorescence staining in a hind-flank xenograft model. In vitro, concurrent RT-SOR produced radioprotection in 3 of 4 cell lines, whereas sequential RT-SOR produced decreased colony formation among all 4. Sequential RT-SOR increased apoptosis compared to RT alone, while concurrent RT-SOR did not. Sorafenib induced reassortment into less radiosensitive phases of the cell cycle through G1-S delay and cell cycle slowing. More double-strand breaks (DSBs) persisted 24 h post-irradiation for RT alone versus concurrent RT-SOR. In vivo, sequential RT-SOR produced the greatest tumor growth delay, while concurrent RT-SOR was similar to RT alone. More persistent DSBs were observed in xenografts treated with sequential RT-SOR or RT alone versus concurrent RT-SOR. Sequential RT-SOR additionally produced a greater reduction in xenograft tumor vascularity and mitotic index than either concurrent RT-SOR or RT alone. In conclusion, sequential RT-SOR demonstrates greater efficacy against HCC than concurrent RT-SOR both in vitro and in vivo. These results may have implications for clinical decision-making and prospective trial design.	0
[Mutation of GJB2 gene in nonsyndromic hearing impairment patients: analysis of 1190 cases]. ||  || To analyze the sequence of GJB2 gene in nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) patients in China. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 1190 NSHI patients randomly selected from the Deaf and Mute Schools of Beijing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and 301 children with normal hearing level used as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted by extraction kits to undergo polymerase chain reaction and sequencing so as to detect the mutations of GJB2 gene. Sixteen pathogenic mutations of GJB2 gene were found, the most common of which included 235delC, 299-300delAT, and 176del16bp. 250 patients (21.05%) carried definite GJB2 mutations, 245 of which (98%) carried at least one of these 3 common mutations. 222 of the 250 patients (88.80%) carried the mutation 235delC with a detection rate of 18.66%. 62 of the 250 patients (24.80%) carried the mutation 299-300delAT with a detection rate of 5.21%. 19 of the 250 patients (7.60%) carried the mutation 176del16bp with a detection rate of 1.60%. The detection rates of these 3 mutations in the NSHI patients were all significantly higher than those among the controls (all P<0.01). The hot spot of GJB2 gene mutations in Chinese NSHI patients is 235delC, followed by 299-300delAT and 176del16bp. These results establish a fundamental basis for drawing a spectrum of GJB2 gene mutation among Chinese population.	4
Mutant p53 in Cancer: Accumulation, Gain-of-Function, and Therapy. || Animals Carcinogenesis Disease Models, Animal Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and over half of human cancers contain p53 mutations. Majority of p53 mutations in cancer are missense mutations, leading to the expression of full-length mutant p53 (mutp53) protein. While the critical role of wild-type p53 in tumor suppression has been firmly established, mounting evidence has demonstrated that many tumor-associated mutp53 proteins not only lose the tumor-suppressive function of wild-type p53 but also gain new activities to promote tumorigenesis independently of wild-type p53, termed gain-of-function. Mutant p53 protein often accumulates to very high levels in tumors, contributing to malignant progression. Recently, mutp53 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying mutp53 protein accumulation and gain-of-function will accelerate the development of targeted therapies for human cancer harboring mutp53. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the studies on mutp53 protein accumulation and gain-of-function and targeted therapies for mutp53 in human cancer.	0
Non-V600 BRAF mutations recurrently found in lung cancer predict sensitivity to the combination of Trametinib and Dabrafenib. ||  || Approximately half of BRAF-mutated Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harbor a non-V600 BRAF mutation, accounting for ∼40,000 annual deaths worldwide. Recent studies have revealed the benefits of combined targeted therapy with a RAF-inhibitor (Dabrafenib) and a MEK-inhibitor (Trametinib) in treating V600 BRAF mutant cancers, including NSCLC. In contrast, sensitivity of non-V600 BRAF mutations to these inhibitors is not documented. Non-V600 mutations can either increase or impair BRAF kinase activity. However, impaired BRAF kinases can still activate the ERK pathway in a CRAF-dependent manner. Herein, beyond describing a cohort of BRAF mutant NSCLC patients and functionally analyzing 13 tumor-derived BRAF mutations, we demonstrate that both types of non-V600 BRAF mutations can be sensitive to clinically relevant doses of Dabrafenib and Trametinib in HEK293T cells, in lung epithelial cellular model (BEAS-2B) and in human cancer cell lines harboring non-V600 BRAF mutations. ERK activity induced by both types of these mutations is further reduced by combinatorial drug treatment. Moreover, the combination leads to more prolonged ERK inhibition and has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cells harboring both types of non-V600 BRAF mutations. This study provides a basis for the clinical exploration of non-V600 BRAF mutant lung cancers upon treatment with Trametinib and Dabrafenib.	0
Mitochondrial 12S rRNA variants in 1642 Han Chinese pediatric subjects with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. || Adolescent Age Factors Aminoglycosides Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool Female Gene Frequency Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Point Mutation RNA RNA, Mitochondrial RNA, Ribosomal Severity of Illness Index || In this report, we investigated the frequency and spectrum of mitochondrial 12S rRNA variants in a large cohort of 1642 Han Chinese pediatric subjects with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Mutational analysis of 12S rRNA gene in these subjects identified 68 (54 known and 14 novel) variants. The frequencies of known 1555A>G and 1494C>T mutations were 3.96% and 0.18%, respectively, in this cohort with nonsyndromic and aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Prevalence of other putative deafness-associated mutation at positions 1095 and 961 were 0.61% and 1.7% in this cohort, respectively. Furthermore, the 745A>G, 792C>T, 801A>G, 839A>G, 856A>G, 1027A>G, 1192C>T, 1192C>A, 1310C>T, 1331A>G, 1374A>G and 1452T>C variants conferred increased sensitivity to ototoxic drugs or nonsyndromic deafness as they were absent in 449 Chinese controls and localized at highly conserved nucleotides of this rRNA. However, other variants appeared to be polymorphisms. Moreover, 65 Chinese subjects carrying the 1555A>G mutation exhibited bilateral and sensorineural hearing loss. A wide range of severity, age-of-onset and audiometric configuration was observed among these subjects. In particular, the sloping and flat-shaped patterns were the common audiograms in individuals carrying the 1555A>G mutation. The phenotypic variability in subjects carrying these 12S rRNA mutations indicated the involvement of nuclear modifier genes, mitochondrial haplotypes, epigenetic and environmental factors in the phenotypic manifestation of these mutations. Therefore, our data demonstrated that mitochondrial 12S rRNA is the hot spot for mutations associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity.	4
ENerGetIcs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: traNslation between MRI, PET and cardiac myofilament function (ENGINE study). ||  || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant heart disease mostly due to mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. HCM is characterised by asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle (LV) in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease. At present it lacks specific treatment to prevent or reverse cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy in mutation carriers and HCM patients. Previous studies have indicated that sarcomere mutations increase energetic costs of cardiac contraction and cause myocardial dysfunction and hypertrophy. By using a translational approach, we aim to determine to what extent disturbances of myocardial energy metabolism underlie disease progression in HCM. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients and aortic valve stenosis (AVS) patients will undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) with acetate and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with tissue tagging before and 4 months after myectomy surgery or aortic valve replacement + septal biopsy. Myectomy tissue or septal biopsy will be used to determine efficiency of sarcomere contraction in-vitro, and results will be compared with in-vivo cardiac performance. Healthy subjects and non-hypertrophic HCM mutation carriers will serve as a control group. Our study will reveal whether perturbations in cardiac energetics deteriorate during disease progression in HCM and whether these changes are attributed to cardiac remodelling or the presence of a sarcomere mutation per se. In-vitro studies in hypertrophied cardiac muscle from HOCM and AVS patients will establish whether sarcomere mutations increase ATP consumption of sarcomeres in human myocardium. Our follow-up imaging study in HOCM and AVS patients will reveal whether impaired cardiac energetics are restored by cardiac surgery.	4
Relationship between genotype, phenylalanine hydroxylase expression and in vitro activity and metabolic phenotype in phenylketonuria. ||  || Residual phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity is the main determinant of the metabolic phenotype in phenylketonuria (PKU). The genotypic heterogeneity of PKU, involving >1000 PAH variants and over 2500 different genotypes, makes genotype-based phenotype prediction challenging. While a relationship between PAH variants and the metabolic phenotype is well established, we questioned the importance of PAH expression and residual in vitro activity for the metabolic phenotype. Thirty-four PAH variants (p.F39 L, p.A47V, p.D59Y, p.I65S, p.R68G, p.R68S, p.E76G, p.A104D, p.D143G, p.R155H, p.R176L, p.V190A, p.G218 V, p.R241C, p.R243Q, p.P244L, p.R252W, p.R261Q, p.E280K, p.R297H, p.A300S, p.I306V, p.A309V, p.L311P, p.A313T, p.L348 V, p.V388 M, A403V, p.R408Q, p.R408W, p.R413P, p.D415N, p.Y417H, and p.A434D) were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and expression of PAH was investigated. Expression patterns were compared with in vitro PAH activity and allelic phenotype values (APVs). In vitro PAH activity was significantly higher (p < .01) in variants associated with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (PAH activity = 52.1 ± 8.5%; APV = 6.7-10.0) than that in classic PKU variants (PAH activity = 21.1 ± 7.0%; APV = 0-2.7). Mild PKU variants (PAH activity = 40.2 ± 7.6%; APV = 2.8-6.6) were not significantly different from mild hyperphenylalaninemia, but there was a difference (p < .048) compared with classic PKU phenotypes.	1 3
Clinical characteristics and registry-validated extended pedigrees of germline TP53 mutation carriers in Denmark. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Denmark Female Genes, p53 Germ-Line Mutation Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Pedigree Registries Young Adult || TP53 mutation carrier (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, LFS) cohort studies often suffer from lack of extensive pedigree exploration. We performed a nation-wide exploration of TP53 mutation carrier families identified through all clinical genetics departments in Denmark. Pedigrees were expanded and verified using unique national person identification, cancer, cause of death, pathology, and church registries. We identified 30 confirmed, six obligate and 14 assumed carriers in 15 families harboring 14 different mutations, including five novel and three de novo germline mutations. All but two (96%) developed cancer by age 54 years [mean debut age; 29.1 y., median 33.0 y., n = 26 (17F, 9M), range 1-54 y]]. Cancer was the primary cause of all deaths [average age at death; 34.5 years]. Two tumors were identified through registry data alone. Two independent families harbored novel c.80delC mutations shown to be related through an ancestor born in 1907. This exhaustive national collection yielded markedly fewer TP53 mutation carriers than the 300-1,100 expected based on estimated background population frequencies. Germline TP53 mutations in Denmark are likely to be drastically underdiagnosed despite their severe phenotype. Following recent advances in surveillance options of LFS patients, lack of pre-symptomatic testing may lead to the mismanagement of some individuals.	4
Pigmented trichoblastoma developed in a sebaceous nevus: HRAS mutation as a common molecular driver. || Adult Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Predisposition to Disease Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans Immunohistochemistry Membrane Proteins Mutation Nevus, Sebaceous of Jadassohn Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Scalp Sebaceous Gland Neoplasms || A 40-year-old woman presented with a pigmented nodule on a previously existing yellowish, verrucous plaque on the scalp. The histological diagnosis was consistent with a pigmented trichoblastoma developed within a sebaceous nevus (SN). A multigene hotspot mutational profiling of the BRAF, NRAS, HRAS and KRAS genes was carried out, and a shared G13R HRAS mutation in both the trichoblastoma and the sebaceous nevus components was found. These data support a common molecular landscape of the two lesions.	4

Spectrum of BRCA1/2 variants in 940 patients from Argentina including novel, deleterious and recurrent germline mutations: impact on healthcare and clinical practice. ||  || BRCA1/2 mutations in Latin America are scarcely documented and in serious need of knowledge about the spectrum of BRCA pathogenic variants, information which may alter clinical practice and subsequently improve patient outcome. In addition, the search for data on testing policies in different regions constitutes a fundamental strength for the present study, which analyzesBRCA1/2 gene sequences and large rearrangements in 940 probands with familial and/or personal history of breast/ovary cancer (BOC). In non-mutated DNA samples, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification assays (MLPA) were used for the analysis of large rearrangements. Our studies detected 179 deleterious mutations out of 940 (19.04%) probands, including 5 large rearrangements and 22 novel mutations. The recurrent mutations accounted for 15.08% of the total and only 2.87% of the probands analyzed, very different from a Hispanic panel previously described. a) this first comprehensive description of the spectrum in BRCA1/2 sheds light on the low frequency of recurrent mutations; b) this information is key in clinical practice to select adequate sequencing studies in our population, subsequently improve patient outcome and prevent damage associated to false normal reports resulting from the use of invalid population panels; c) panels of mutations from other populations should be cautiously validated before imported, even those of apparently similar origin, a concept to be considered beyond significance in Argentina.	4
p53 downregulates its activating vaccinia-related kinase 1, forming a new autoregulatory loop. || Cell Line Chloroquine Down-Regulation Endosomes Enzyme Stability Fibroblasts Homeostasis Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Lysosomes Mutation Peptide Hydrolases Protein Structure, Tertiary Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 RNA, Small Interfering Sequence Deletion Serine Proteinase Inhibitors Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ultraviolet Rays || The stable accumulation of p53 is detrimental to the cell because it blocks cell growth and division. Therefore, increases in p53 levels are tightly regulated, mainly by its transcriptional target, mdm2, that downregulates p53. Elucidation of new signaling pathways requires the characterization of the members and the nature of their connection. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) contributes to p53 stabilization by partly interfering with its mdm2-mediated degradation, among other mechanisms; therefore, it is likely that some form of autoregulation between VRK1 and p53 must occur. We report here the identification of an autoregulatory loop between p53 and its stabilizing VRK1. There is an inverse correlation between VRK1 and p53 levels in cell lines, and induction of p53 by UV light downregulates VRK1 in fibroblasts. As the amount of p53 protein increases, there is a downregulation of the VRK1 protein level independent of its promoter. This effect is indirect but requires a transcriptionally active p53. The three most common transcriptionally inactive mutations detected in hereditary (Li-Fraumeni syndrome) and sporadic human cancer, p53(R175H), p53(R248W), and p53(R273H), as well as p53(R280K), are unable to induce downregulation of VRK1 protein. The p53 isoforms Delta40p53 and p53beta, lacking the transactivation and oligomerization domains, respectively, do not downregulate VRK1. VRK1 downregulation induced by p53 is independent of mdm2 activity and proteasome-mediated degradation since it occurs in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and in mdm2-deficient cells. The degradation of VRK1 is sensitive to chloroquine, an inhibitor of the late endosome-lysosome transport, and to serine protease inhibitors of the lysosomal pathway.	0
Experience with precision genomics and tumor board, indicates frequent target identification, but barriers to delivery. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Biomarkers, Tumor Child Child, Preschool Computational Biology Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genomics Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Neoplasms Precision Medicine Signal Transduction Treatment Outcome Young Adult || The ability to analyze the genomics of malignancies has opened up new possibilities for off-label targeted therapy in cancers that are refractory to standard therapy. At Mayo Clinic these efforts are organized through the Center for Individualized Medicine (CIM). Prior to GTB, datasets were analyzed and integrated by a team of bioinformaticians and cancer biologists. Therapeutically actionable mutations were identified in 65% (92/141) of the patients tested with 32% (29/92) receiving genomically targeted therapy with FDA approved drugs or in an independent clinical trial with 45% (13/29) responding. Standard of care (SOC) options were continued by 15% (14/92) of patients tested before exhausting SOC options, with 71% (10/14) responding to treatment. Over 35% (34/92) of patients with actionable targets were not treated with 65% (22/34) choosing comfort measures or passing away. Patients (N = 165) were referred to the CIM Clinic between October 2012 and December 2015. All patients received clinical genomic panel testing with selected subsets receiving array comparative genomic hybridization and clinical whole exome sequencing to complement and validate panel findings. A genomic tumor board (GTB) reviewed results and, when possible, developed treatment recommendations. Treatment decisions driven by tumor genomic analysis can lead to significant clinical benefit in a minority of patients. The success of genomically driven therapy depends both on access to drugs and robustness of bioinformatics analysis. While novel clinical trial designs are increasing the utility of genomic testing, robust data sharing of outcomes is needed to optimize clinical benefit for all patients.	4
p53 status, cellular recovery and cell cycle arrest as prognosticators of in vitro radiosensitivity in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. || Adenocarcinoma Alleles Cell Cycle Cell Survival Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cyclins DNA Topoisomerases, Type I DNA Topoisomerases, Type II G1 Phase Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms Prognosis Radiation Tolerance Retinoblastoma Protein Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 X-Rays || To investigate the factors contributing to the in vitro radiosensitivity of four human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines differing in p53 status, and the basis for the lack of post-irradiation G1 arrest in the two cell lines that have retained a wild-type p53 allele. Cells were X-irradiated and the parameters related to radiosensitivity, as well as the modulation of gene products linked to regulation of cell cycle transit (p53, p21/WAF1/CIP1, pRb) or DNA replication and repair (DNA topoisomerase I and II), were determined. Both cell lines expressing either mutant (mt) R248W or R273H p53 proteins were more radioresistant. All the cell lines arrested in G2. None of the cell lines arrested in G1 and this was linked to the inability to upregulate p21/WAF1/CIP1. There were no correlations between p53 status and the magnitude or time of maximum G2 arrest. However, there was a negative correlation between a protracted arrest in G2 and the ability to recover from potentially lethal damage (PLD). Variation in radiosensitivity is related to p53 status, but the survival advantage conferred by having mutant p53 status is not readily explained neither by recovery from PLD nor by cell cycle arrest kinetics. There is no p53-independent pathway for the recruitment of p21 in these cell lines following irradiation.	0
Mutant p53 disrupts the stress MAPK activation circuit induced by ASK1-dependent stabilization of Daxx. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Cell Line, Tumor Enzyme Activation HT29 Cells HeLa Cells Humans MAP Kinase Kinase 4 MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5 MAP Kinase Signaling System Nuclear Proteins Phosphorylation Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Daxx is a regulatory protein for apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) which activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways in response to stressors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Here, we show that TNFalpha treatment induces the accumulation of Daxx protein through ASK1 activation by preventing its proteasome-dependent degradation. ASK1 directly phosphorylates Daxx at Ser(176) and Ser(184) and Daxx is required for the sustained activation of JNK. Tumorigenic mutant p53, which binds to Daxx and inhibits Daxx-dependent activation of ASK1, prevents Daxx phosphorylation and stabilization. When mutant p53 was depleted in cancer cells, Daxx was accumulated and the cell-killing effect of TNFalpha was restored. Our results indicate that Daxx not only activates ASK1 but also is a downstream target of ASK1 and that accumulated Daxx further activates ASK1. Thus, the Daxx-ASK1 positive feedback loop amplifying JNK/p38 signaling plays an important role in the cell-killing effects of stressors, such as TNFalpha. Tumorigenic mutant p53 disrupts this circuit and makes cells more tolerable to stresses, as its gain-of-function mechanism.	0
Association between BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R mutations and clinicopathologic characteristics, risk factors and clinical outcome of primary invasive cutaneous melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Environmental Exposure Female Follow-Up Studies GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Odds Ratio Prognosis Prospective Studies Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Risk Factors Skin Neoplasms Survival Rate Treatment Outcome Ultraviolet Rays || Previous studies suggest that solar UV exposure in early life is predictive of cutaneous melanoma risk in adulthood, whereas the relation of BRAF mutation with sun exposure and disease prognosis has been less certain. We investigated the associations between BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61R) mutations and known risk factors, clinicopathologic characteristics and clinical outcomes of melanoma in a case series of primary invasive cutaneous melanoma from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). Somatic BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61R) mutations of 127 primary invasive melanomas from the NHS cohort were determined by pyrosequencing using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block tissues. Logistic regression analyses were performed to detect the associations of mutations with melanoma risk factors, and Kaplan-Meier method was used to examine associations between mutations and survival. The odds ratios for harboring BRAF(V600E) mutations were 5.54 (95% CI 1.19-25.8, p(trend) = 0.02) for women residing in states with UV index ≥ 7 versus those residing in states with UV index ≤5 at 30 years of age. Patients with BRAF(V600E) mutations tended to have shorter melanoma-specific survival when compared to patients with wild type at both loci (median survival time 110 vs. 159 months) (p = 0.03). No association was found between NRASQ61R mutation and melanoma risk factors or melanoma-specific survival. BRAF(V600E) mutations in primary cutaneous melanomas were associated with residence in locations with medium and high UV indices in mid-life. BRAF(V600E) mutation may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis among melanoma patients.	4

The 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) associated with congenital deafness: European carrier frequencies and evidence for its origin in ancient Greece. || Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Europe Genetic Carrier Screening Greece Humans Mutation || The 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) at the DFNB1 locus represents the most common mutation in Caucasian patients with genetic sensorineural deafness. This new meta-analysis concerns published carrier frequencies of the 35delG mutation in 27 populations for 6,628 unrelated individuals in Europe and in the Middle East; the mean carrier frequency of the mutation is 1.9%. Compared on a regional basis, the most elevated carrier frequency value is of 1 individual carrier in 31 in southern Europe. It is probable that the 35delG mutation originated in ancient Greece and was subsequently propagated in other Mediterranean countries (especially in Italy) during recent historical times.	4
PIK3CA dependence and sensitivity to therapeutic targeting in urothelial carcinoma. || Animals Blotting, Western Carcinoma, Transitional Cell Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Gene Knockdown Techniques Heterografts Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mutation Urinary Bladder Neoplasms || Many urothelial carcinomas (UC) contain activating PIK3CA mutations. In telomerase-immortalized normal urothelial cells (TERT-NHUC), ectopic expression of mutant PIK3CA induces PI3K pathway activation, cell proliferation and cell migration. However, it is not clear whether advanced UC tumors are PIK3CA-dependent and whether PI3K pathway inhibition is a good therapeutic option in such cases. We used retrovirus-mediated delivery of shRNA to knock down mutant PIK3CA in UC cell lines and assessed effects on pathway activation, cell proliferation, migration and tumorigenicity. The effect of the class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 was assessed in a panel of UC cell lines with a range of known molecular alterations in the PI3K pathway. Specific knockdown of PIK3CA inhibited proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumor growth of cells with PIK3CA mutations. Sensitivity to GDC-0941 was dependent on hotspot PIK3CA mutation status. Cells with rare PIK3CA mutations and co-occurring TSC1 or PTEN mutations were less sensitive. Furthermore, downstream PI3K pathway alterations in TSC1 or PTEN or co-occurring AKT1 and RAS gene mutations were associated with GDC-0941 resistance. Mutant PIK3CA is a potent oncogenic driver in many UC cell lines and may represent a valuable therapeutic target in advanced bladder cancer.	0
Androgen-independent growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells is mediated by gain-of-function mutant p53. || Alleles Androgens Cell Division Genes, p53 Humans Male Mutation Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent Prostatic Neoplasms Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Receptors, Androgen Transfection Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutations of p53 are common in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (CaP), suggesting the possibility that these mutations may be involved in the progression of CaP to androgen-independent (AI) growth. However, at present no direct evidence has been presented linking p53 mutations with AI growth of CaP. We established five stably transfected LNCaP cell lines: four containing gain-of-function (GOF) mutant p53 alleles (G245S, R248W, R273H, and R273C) and one containing a non-GOF p53 mutant allele (P151S). The four GOF p53 sublines were able to grow under androgen-depleted conditions, whereas the LNCaP parental line, vector-only line, and the non-GOF line were unable to grow. To investigate the mechanism of the AI growth displayed by the GOF p53 mutants, Western blotting or ELISA were used to examine the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), the AR-regulated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), as well as Akt and Bcl-2 under androgen-depleted conditions. On androgen ablation, the levels of AR decreased in the four GOF p53 sublines compared with the control lines. This decreased AR expression was accompanied by attenuated receptor activity, because a decrease in prostate-specific antigen levels compared with parental LNCaP cells was also observed. Levels of phosphorylated Akt increased in both the GOF p53 sublines and the control lines. Bcl-2 remains unchanged or showed reduced expression in all of the cell lines in the absence of androgen compared to the presence of androgen. These observations suggest that GOF p53 mutants mediate the AI growth of LNCaP cells in an AR-independent fashion, and that both Akt and Bcl-2 are not involved in this process.	0

Without adequate levels of alpha-glucosidase, there is a progressive accumulation of glycogen inside the lysosome, resulting in lysosomal expansion in many tissues, although the major clinical manifestations are seen in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Pompe disease presents as a continuum of clinical phenotypes. In the most severe cases, disease onset occurs in infancy and death results from cardiac and respiratory failure within the first 1 or 2 years of life. In the milder late-onset forms, cardiac muscle is spared and muscle weakness is the primary symptom. Weakness of respiratory muscles is the major cause of mortality in these cases. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme; Genzyme Corp., Framingham, MA) is now available for all forms of glycogen storage disease type II. ERT has shown remarkable success in reversing pathology in cardiac muscle and extending life expectancy in infantile patients. However, skeletal muscle has proven to be a more challenging target for ERT. Although ERT is less effective in skeletal muscle than was hoped for, the lessons learned from both clinical and pre-clinical ERT studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. A combination of fundamental studies and clinical follow-up, as well as exploration of other therapies, is necessary to take treatment for glycogen storage disease type II to the next level.	1
Heterogeneity of transcriptional activity of mutant p53 proteins and p53 DNA target sequences. || Base Sequence DNA Genes, p53 Humans Lung Neoplasms Molecular Sequence Data Temperature Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Transcriptional activity of p53 was monitored by cotransfection of pCMV expression vectors containing wild-type and mutant p53 cDNAs into the p53-null H1299 lung cancer cells along with luciferase reporter plasmids containing different p53 target sequences in the 5' regulatory region: fragment A of the ribosomal gene cluster (RGC); p53 consensus sequence (p53CON); or a tandemly linked RGC+p53CON sequence. Our results show: (1) wild-type p53 stimulates the transcription of reporter genes with p53CON and RGC in their 5' region while most p53 mutants occurring in human cancers have lost this activity; (2) the R273H mutant retains transcriptional activity for the p53CON sequence but not RGC; (3) some mutants are temperature-sensitive for the transcriptional activity with the p53CON but not the RGC sequence; (4) p53 mutants vary in their ability to inhibit wild-type p53 transactivation but there is no difference between p53CON and RGC sequences; (5) lung cancer cells with endogenous mutant p53 proteins (M246I in H23 cells and R248L in H322 cells) retain transcriptional activity for the p53CON but not the RGC sequence. We conclude that p53 DNA target sequences vary in their response to mutant p53 proteins, and that p53 mutants vary in several transactivation related functions.	0
Interaction of tRNA with MEK2 in pancreatic cancer cells. || Butadienes Cell Line, Tumor HEK293 Cells Humans MAP Kinase Kinase 2 Mutation Nitriles Pancreatic Neoplasms RNA, Transfer || Although the translational function of tRNA has long been established, extra translational functions of tRNA are still being discovered. We previously developed a computational method to systematically predict new tRNA-protein complexes and experimentally validated six candidate proteins, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (MEK2), that interact with tRNA in HEK293T cells. However, consequences of the interaction between tRNA and these proteins remain to be elucidated. Here we tested the consequence of the interaction between tRNA and MEK2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines. We also generated disease and drug resistance-derived MEK2 mutants (Q60P, P128Q, S154F, E207K) to evaluate the function of the tRNA-MEK2 interaction. Our results demonstrate that tRNA interacts with the wild-type and mutant MEK2 in pancreatic cancer cells; furthermore, the MEK2 inhibitor U0126 significantly reduces the tRNA-MEK2 interaction. In addition, tRNA affects the catalytic activity of the wild type and mutant MEK2 proteins in different ways. Overall, our findings demonstrate the interaction of tRNA with MEK2 in pancreatic cancer cells and suggest that tRNA may impact MEK2 activity in cancer cells.	0
[Clinical picture of hearing defects caused by Cx26 gene mutations]. ||  || The study of prevalence of Cx26 gene mutations in children suffering from congenital and prespeech non-syndromal hypoacusis was conducted in Russian population since 2001. The screening of this group of children showed that 35delG mutation occurred in 53%. This index depends on the region and clinical characteristics of the groups studied. Thus, in the family burden it increased to 65% and more. The article presents clinical characteristics of hearing problems caused by 35delG mutation in Cx26 gene. Clinical evidence was obtained on 197 patients with the affected genotype (146 homozygotes and 51 heterozygotes by deletion). Most of deletion homozygotes were diagnosed early (under 1 year) and had bilateral neurosensory hypoacusis with frequent severe hearing loss (75.7%). No family burden was seen in 47% patients with abnormal genotype. In the group studied only 24% cases had no familial burden. 20% children were born by mother with abnormal pregnancy and delivery, 2.5% had the history of severe infections except meningitis, 11.7% - of first year diseases. Cx26 gene mutations were diagnosed in half cases of hypoacusis in children whose parents attribute hearing loss to administration of antibiotics.	4
First clinical and genetic description of a family diagnosed with late-onset Pompe disease from Costa Rica. || Age of Onset Costa Rica Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation alpha-Glucosidases || Glycogen storage disease type II, also known as Pompe disease, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of enzymatic activity of acid alpha-glucosidase. The wide phenotypical variation of this disease relates to the amount of residual enzymatic activity depending on the combination of mutations on each allele. We confirmed Pompe disease in a patient that presented with progressive weakness, recurrent episodes of respiratory failure associated with pneumonia, a predominantly demyelinating mixed sensorimotor polyneuropathy and paraspinal complex repetitive discharges. Genetic analysis of the GAA gene from this patient revealed two pathogenic compound heterozygous mutations: c.-32-13T>G (rs386834236, intronic), c.2560C>T (rs121907943, p.Arg854Ter); and one variant of unknown significance: c.1551+42G>A (rs115427918, intronic). We found expected mutations in two siblings and two nieces. Genetic variants reported in this family reflect on the European and African ancestry that we carry in our Costa Rican population.	1
p53 Gene mutations in sporadic colorectal carcinoma in Guangxi region. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over China Colonic Neoplasms DNA, Neoplasm Exons Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Rectal Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || To explore the spectrum of p53 gene mutations of sporadic colorectal carcinoma in Guangxi, a Zhuang autonomous region in southern China, we examined exons 2 approximately 11 and exon-intron junctions of p53 gene from 48 patients with sporadic colorectal carcinoma by using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA direct sequencing. As a result, p53 gene mutations were found in 31.25 percent (15/48) of our patients. A total of 13 types of p53 gene mutations were found, namely, c.370T > G, c.524G > A, c.528C > G, c.529_546del18, c.536A > G, c.736A > G, c.743G > A, c.770_771del2, c.772G > T, c.814G > A, c.949delC, c.782+1G > A, and c.919+1G > C. Only a double heterozygote for c.370T > G and c.529_546del18 was found. All the other mutations were heterozygous. No homozygote was found. 524G > A was the most common mutation, accounting for 18.75 percent (3/16). c.370T > G could not be found in the whole somatic mutation section of IARC TP 53 mutation database (2004 version). c.528C > G, c.949delC, c.782+1G > A, and c.919+1G > C could not be found in colorectal carcinomas reported in the somatic mutation section of IARC TP 53 mutation database (2004 version). The frequency (45.83 percent) of p53 gene mutations in > or = 60 years old patients was higher than that (16.67 percent) in < 60 year old patients (P < 0.05). The frequency (47.83 percent) of p53 gene mutations in rectal carcinoma was higher than that (16 percent) in colonic carcinoma (P < 0.025).	4
New contributions to the study of common double mutants in the human LDL receptor gene. || Case-Control Studies Haplotypes Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Receptors, LDL Spain Time Factors || Variations in the gene encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) can cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders in humans. The functional effects of the p.Gln92Glu and p.Asn564His alterations are predicted as benign, but the c.313 + 1G>C and p.Lys799_Phe801del changes are believed to cause disease. Although p.Gln92Glu and c.313 + 1G>C have been observed only in Spain, p.Asn564His and p.Lys799_Phe801del are widespread in Western Europe. In order to estimate the ages (t generations) of these four variants of the gene, to determine their possible origin and to consider the influence of age and selective pressure on their spread, we analyzed 86 healthy individuals and 126 FH patients in Spain. Most of the FH patients investigated carried two of these four LDLR variants simultaneously, while only one patient carried three of them simultaneously. Haplotype analyses were based on five LDLR SNPs: c.81T>C, c.1413G>A, c.1725C>T, c.1959T>C and c.2232G>A. The results suggest that p.Gln92Glu and c.313 + 1G>C arose at about the same time (99 and 103 generations ago, respectively) in the CACTG haplotype and that p.Asn564His and p.Lys799_Phe801del appeared in the CGCCG haplotype and might be slightly more recent variations (92 and 95 generations ago, respectively). Low selective pressures could explain the maintenance of these variants in spite of their ages. The origin of p.Gln92Glu and c.313 + 1G>C appears to be in Spain whereas p.Asn564His and p.Lys799_Phe801del could have been introduced in Spain by Celtic migrations in the seventh to fifth centuries BC.	4
The prevalence of melanocortin-4 receptor gene mutations in Slovak obese children and adolescents. || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Infant Male Mutation Obesity, Morbid Pedigree Prevalence Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Slovakia Young Adult || Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency is the most frequent monogenic form of obesity. The contribution of MC4R mutations to the Slovak population has not been investigated as yet. We screened the coding sequence of the MC4R gene in a cohort of 210 Slovak obese children and adolescents. We identified four different mutations in four patients, giving a mutation detection rate of 0.95%. Of these, three were missense mutations previously identified and characterized by other research groups (p.R7C, p.S127L and p. R305W, respectively). One was a novel nonsense mutation p.W174* detected in a severely obese 7-year-old boy. This mutation was further analyzed in family segregation analysis and exhibited variable penetrance. Two known amino acid polymorphisms (p.V103I and p.I251L) were also identified in seven subjects of our cohort group. We also performed multifactorial statistical analysis to determine the influence of genotypes on standard biochemical blood markers. No significant influence was observed in carriers of DNA variants on tested parameters. We conclude that rare heterozygous MC4R mutations contribute to the onset of obesity only in a few cases in the Slovak population.	4
[Phenotype predictions of the pathogenic nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in deafness-causing gene COCH]. ||  || The COCH (Coagulation factor C homology) gene, located in human chromosome 14q12-q13, is the first gene identified to cause vestibular dysfunction. COCH encodes cochlin, which contains an N-terminal LCCL (Limulus factor C, cochlin, and late gestation lung protein Lgl1) domain and a C-temimal vWFA (Von Willebrand factor type A) domain. Recently, functional research of COCH mutations and cochlin have come under the spotlight in the field of hereditary deafness. Approximately 16 mutations in COCH have been confirmed to date, among which 13 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are the most common form of genetic variations. Nonetheless, there is poor knowledge on the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype of the other nsSNPs in COCH. Here we analyzed deleterious nsSNPs from all SNPs in the COCH gene in the vWFA domain based on different computational methods and identified eight potential pathogenic nsSNPs (I176T, R180Q, G265E, V269L, I368N, I372T, R416C and Y424D) after combining literatures with 3D structures. Meanwhile, the protein structures of six reported pathogenic nsSNPs (P51S, G87W, I109N, I109T, W117R and F121S) in the LCCL domain have been constructed, and we identified aberrant structural changes in loops and chains. The prediction of pathogenic mutations for COCH nsSNPs will provide a blueprint for screening pathogenic mutations, and it will be beneficial to the functional research of COCH and cochlin in this field.	4
Acquired TET2 mutation in one patient with familial platelet disorder with predisposition to AML led to the development of pre-leukaemic clone resulting in T2-ALL and AML-M0. || Adult Antigens, CD34 Blood Platelet Disorders Blood Platelets Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit DNA-Binding Proteins High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Male Proto-Oncogene Proteins || Familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukaemia (FPD/AML) is characterized by germline RUNX1 mutations, thrombocytopaenia, platelet dysfunction and a risk of developing acute myeloid and in rare cases lymphoid T leukaemia. Here, we focus on a case of a man with a familial history of RUNX1R174Q mutation who developed at the age of 42 years a T2-ALL and, 2 years after remission, an AML-M0. Both AML-M0 and T2-ALL blast populations demonstrated a loss of 1p36.32-23 and 17q11.2 regions as well as other small deletions, clonal rearrangements of both TCRγ and TCRδ and a presence of 18 variants at a frequency of more than 40%. Additional variants were identified only in T2-ALL or in AML-M0 evoking the existence of a common original clone, which gave rise to subclonal populations. Next generation sequencing (NGS) performed on peripheral blood-derived CD34+ cells 5 years prior to T2-ALL development revealed only the missense TET2P1962T mutation at a frequency of 1%, which increases to more than 40% in fully transformed leukaemic T2-ALL and AML-M0 clones. This result suggests that TET2P1962T mutation in association with germline RUNX1R174Q mutation leads to amplification of a haematopoietic clone susceptible to acquire other transforming alterations.	4
Simultaneous inhibition of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase induces p53-independent apoptosis via down-regulation of Mcl-1 in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. || Apoptosis Azacitidine Benzamides Blotting, Western Cell Cycle Cell Proliferation Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 DNA Modification Methylases Decitabine Drug Therapy, Combination Enzyme Inhibitors Epigenomics Flow Cytometry Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Mutation, Missense Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Pyridines RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We have recently established the MV4-11 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) subline, designated as MV4-11 TP53 R248W, which possesses a missense mutation (CGG→TGG; R248W) in the TP53 gene, leading to inactivation of this transcription factor. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) induced apoptosis in MV4-11, but not in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. Another class of anti-epigenetic agent histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) inhibited the proliferation of both MV4-11 and MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. Notably, when 5-AzadC was combined with HDACI MS-275, apoptosis in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells was significantly enhanced in parallel with activation of the caspase cascade, up-regulation of p21waf1 and γ-H2AX, and down-regulation of Mcl-1. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase 3 by the pan-caspase inhibitor attenuated the combination of 5-AzadC and MS-275-mediated apoptosis and down-regulation of Mcl-1 in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. Moreover, down-regulation of p21waf1 in MV4-11 R248W cells by a small interfering RNA blunted activation of caspase 3 after exposure to the combination of 5-AzadC and MS-275, indicating the role of p21waf1 to activate caspase 3. Taken together, TP53-independent up-regulation of p21waf1 activates caspase 3 and down-regulates Mcl-1 in AML cells. Combination of 5-AzadC and MS-275 may be a promising treatment strategy for individuals with leukemia in which TP53 is inactivated.	0
γ-Secretase Modulators and APH1 Isoforms Modulate γ-Secretase Cleavage but Not Position of ε-Cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). || Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor Animals CHO Cells Catalytic Domain Cricetulus Fenofibrate HEK293 Cells Humans Immunoprecipitation Membrane Proteins Mutation Peptide Fragments Peptide Hydrolases Protein Isoforms Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization || The relative increase in Aβ42 peptides from familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) linked APP and PSEN mutations can be related to changes in both ε-cleavage site utilization and subsequent step-wise cleavage. Cleavage at the ε-site releases the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD), and perturbations in the position of ε-cleavage are closely associated with changes in the profile of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) species that are produced and secreted. The mechanisms by which γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) or FAD mutations affect the various γ-secretase cleavages to alter the generation of Aβ peptides have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggested that GSMs do not modulate ε-cleavage of APP, but the data were derived principally from recombinant truncated epitope tagged APP substrate. Here, using full length APP from transfected cells, we investigated whether GSMs modify the ε-cleavage of APP under more native conditions. Our results confirmed the previous findings that ε-cleavage is insensitive to GSMs. In addition, fenofibrate, an inverse GSM (iGSM), did not alter the position or kinetics of ε-cleavage position in vitro. APH1A and APH1B, a subunit of the γ-secretase complex, also modulated Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio without any alterations in ε-cleavage, a result in contrast to what has been observed with PS1 and APP FAD mutations. Consequently, GSMs and APH1 appear to modulate γ-secretase activity and Aβ42 generation by altering processivity but not ε-cleavage site utilization.	0
High sensitivity of both sequencing and real-time PCR analysis of KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer tissue. || Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Gene Frequency Genes, ras Genotype Humans Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity || The KRAS mutation status predicts the outcome of treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor targeted agents, and therefore the testing for KRAS mutations has become an important diagnostic procedure. To optimize the quality of this test, we compared the results of the two most commonly used KRAS mutation tests, cycle sequencing and a real-time PCR-based assay, in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer samples of 511 patients. The results were interpreted in the context of the tumour cell percentage and the assay parameters. In 510 samples KRAS mutation status assessment was successful. A KRAS mutation was detected in 201 tumours (39.4%). Sequencing and the real-time PCR-based assay generated the same result in 486 samples (95.3%). The sequencing result was considered false positive in one (0.2%) and false negative in nine samples (1.8%). The assay result was considered false positive in six (1.2%) and false negative in seven samples (1.4%). Explanations for discrepant test results were a higher sensitivity of the assay in samples with a low tumour cell percentage, occurrence of mutations that are not covered by the assay and δ Ct values approximating the cut-off value of the assay. In conclusion, both sequencing and the real-time PCR-based assay are reliable tests for KRAS mutation analysis in FFPE colorectal cancer samples, with a sensitivity of 95.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.7-97.9%) and 96.5% (95% CI 93.0-98.6%), respectively. The real-time PCR based assay is the method of choice in samples with a tumour cell percentage below 30%.	4
Rescue of non-sense mutated p53 tumor suppressor gene by aminoglycosides. || Amikacin Aminoglycosides Animals Anti-Bacterial Agents Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor Codon, Nonsense Genes, p53 Gentamicins Humans Mice RNA, Messenger Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutation-based treatments are a new development in genetic medicine, in which the nature of the mutation dictates the therapeutic strategy. Interest has recently focused on diseases caused by premature termination codons (PTCs). Drugs inducing the readthrough of these PTCs restore the production of a full-length protein. In this study, we explored the possibility of using aminoglycoside antibiotics to induce the production of a full-length functional p53 protein from a gene carrying a PTC. We identified a human cancer cell line containing a PTC, for which high levels of readthrough were obtained in the presence of aminoglycosides. Using these cells, we demonstrated that aminoglycoside treatment stabilized the mutant mRNA, which would otherwise have been degraded by non-sense-mediated decay, resulting in the production of a functional full-length p53 protein. Finally, we showed that aminoglycoside treatment decreased the viability of cancer cells specifically in the presence of nonsense-mutated p53 gene. These results open possibilities of developing promising treatments of cancers linked with non-sense mutations in tumor suppressor genes. They show that molecules designed to induce stop-codon readthrough can be used to inhibit tumor growth and offer a rational basis for developing new personalized strategies that could diversify the existing arsenal of cancer therapies.	0
Analytical and Clinical Validation of a Digital Sequencing Panel for Quantitative, Highly Accurate Evaluation of Cell-Free Circulating Tumor DNA. || DNA, Neoplasm Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Neoplasms || Next-generation sequencing of cell-free circulating solid tumor DNA addresses two challenges in contemporary cancer care. First this method of massively parallel and deep sequencing enables assessment of a comprehensive panel of genomic targets from a single sample, and second, it obviates the need for repeat invasive tissue biopsies. Digital Sequencing™ is a novel method for high-quality sequencing of circulating tumor DNA simultaneously across a comprehensive panel of over 50 cancer-related genes with a simple blood test. Here we report the analytic and clinical validation of the gene panel. Analytic sensitivity down to 0.1% mutant allele fraction is demonstrated via serial dilution studies of known samples. Near-perfect analytic specificity (> 99.9999%) enables complete coverage of many genes without the false positives typically seen with traditional sequencing assays at mutant allele frequencies or fractions below 5%. We compared digital sequencing of plasma-derived cell-free DNA to tissue-based sequencing on 165 consecutive matched samples from five outside centers in patients with stage III-IV solid tumor cancers. Clinical sensitivity of plasma-derived NGS was 85.0%, comparable to 80.7% sensitivity for tissue. The assay success rate on 1,000 consecutive samples in clinical practice was 99.8%. Digital sequencing of plasma-derived DNA is indicated in advanced cancer patients to prevent repeated invasive biopsies when the initial biopsy is inadequate, unobtainable for genomic testing, or uninformative, or when the patient's cancer has progressed despite treatment. Its clinical utility is derived from reduction in the costs, complications and delays associated with invasive tissue biopsies for genomic testing.	4
Digital next-generation sequencing identifies low-abundance mutations in pancreatic juice samples collected from the duodenum of patients with pancreatic cancer and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. || Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous Adult Aged Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma, Papillary Female Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pancreas Pancreatic Juice Pancreatic Neoplasms Predictive Value of Tests Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA Smad4 Protein Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice contains DNA shed from cells lining the pancreatic ducts. Genetic analysis of this fluid may form a test to detect pancreatic ductal neoplasia. We employed digital next-generation sequencing ('digital NGS') to detect low-abundance mutations in secretin-stimulated juice samples collected from the duodenum of subjects enrolled in Cancer of the Pancreas Screening studies at Johns Hopkins Hospital. For each juice sample, digital NGS necessitated 96 NGS reactions sequencing nine genes. The study population included 115 subjects (53 discovery, 62 validation) (1) with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), (2) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), (3) controls with non-suspicious pancreata. Cases with PDAC and IPMN were more likely to have mutant DNA detected in pancreatic juice than controls (both p<0.0001); mutant DNA concentrations were higher in patients with PDAC than IPMN (p=0.003) or controls (p<0.001). TP53 and/orSMAD4 mutations were commonly detected in juice samples from patients with PDAC and were not detected in controls (p<0.0001); mutantTP53/SMAD4 concentrations could distinguish PDAC from IPMN cases with 32.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity (area under the curve, AUC 0.73, p=0.0002) and controls (AUC 0.82, p<0.0001). Two of four patients who developed pancreatic cancer despite close surveillance hadSMAD4/TP53 mutations from their cancer detected in juice samples collected over 1 year prior to their pancreatic cancer diagnosis when no suspicious pancreatic lesions were detected by imaging. The detection in pancreatic juice of mutations important for the progression of low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasive pancreatic cancer may improve the management of patients undergoing pancreatic screening and surveillance.	4
The preeminence of growth pattern and invasiveness and the limited influence of BRAF and RAS mutations in the occurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma lymph node metastases. || Adult Aged Carcinoma Carcinoma, Papillary Carcinoma, Papillary, Follicular Female Genes, ras Humans Lymphatic Metastasis Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Thyroid Cancer, Papillary Thyroid Neoplasms || Prognostic factors indicative of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) aggressive behaviour remain incompletely established partially due to the different composition of the series on record regarding the relative proportion of classic PTC (CPTC) and follicular variant PTC (FVPTC) subtypes. Several clinico-morphological features of PTC, together with the occurrence of BRAF mutations, are still not fully accepted as markers of aggressiveness. In the present clinico-pathological study of a series of 75 CPTC and FVPTC cases, we evaluated the relative contribution of the morphological features of the tumours and their BRAF and N-RAS status for the occurrence of nodal metastases. The morphological features most closely related to the occurrence of nodal metastases were extra-thyroid extension and poorly circumscribed growth pattern, in both CPTC and FVPTC. Additional features significantly associated to nodal metastases were multicentricity in the CPTC and vascular invasion in the FVPTC group. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 29% of tumours, 41% of CPTC and 16% of FVPTC; N-RAS Q61R mutation was detected in 6% of tumours, 3% of CPTC and 10% of FVPTC. BRAF mutation was significantly more frequent in the CPTC group and in females, and it was detected only in patients older than 20 years, suggesting a late tumourigenic effect in the development of PTC. BRAF mutation was not significantly associated to any of the other studied features related to aggressiveness or nodal metastases. These results highlight the importance of infiltrative growth pattern and invasiveness over the presence of BRAF mutation in classic and follicular variant PTC for the development of nodal metastases.	4
Mutant p53 initiates a feedback loop that involves Egr-1/EGF receptor/ERK in prostate cancer cells. || Cell Line, Tumor Early Growth Response Protein 1 ErbB Receptors Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Feedback, Physiological Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Mutation Promoter Regions, Genetic Prostatic Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) is overexpressed in human prostate tumors and contributes to cancer progression. On the other hand, mutation of p53 is associated with advanced prostate cancer, as well as with metastasis and hormone independence. This study shows that in prostate cell lines in culture, Egr-1 overexpression correlated with an alteration of p53 activity because of the expression of SV40 large T-antigen or because of a mutation in the TP53 gene. In cells containing altered p53 activity, Egr-1 expression was abolished by pharmacological inhibition or RNAi silencing of p53. Although forced expression of wild-type p53 was not sufficient to trigger Egr-1 transcription, four different mutants of p53 were shown to induce Egr-1. Direct binding of p53 to the EGR1 promoter could not be detected. Instead, Egr-1 transcription was driven by the ERK1/2 pathway, as it was abrogated by specific inhibitors of MEK. Egr-1 increased the transcription of HB-EGF (epidermal growth factor), amphiregulin and epiregulin, resulting in autocrine activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and downstream MEK/ERK cascade. Thus, mutant p53 initiates a feedback loop that involves ERK1/2-mediated transactivation of Egr-1, which in turn increases the secretion of EGFR ligands and stimulates the EGFR signaling pathway. Finally, p53 may further regulate this feedback loop by altering the level of EGFR expression.	0
[The effects of newborn genetic screening for GJB2 and hearing follow-ups]. || Base Sequence Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Follow-Up Studies Genetic Testing Hearing Loss Hearing Tests Heterozygote Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Mutation Neonatal Screening Prevalence || To determine the prevalence of GJB2 mutations in newborns and provide clinical experience for newborn genetic screening. Blood samples of 23 836 newborns in Beijing from March 2012 to December 2013 were screened for hot spot mutations of GJB2 associated with hearing loss. The genetic screening results were comprehensively analyzed with hearing results in genetic counseling. One or two pathogenic mutations of GJB2 were spotted in 622(2. 61%) individuals. Among them, numbers of newborns with 1 mutation of c. 35deiG,c. 176191 del16,c. 235delC and c. 299300 delAT were 3,26,467 and 120. One compound heterozygote, and 5 homozygotes were also identified. Five hundred and fifty(88. 6%)newborns were followed up by telephones and SMS (short message service) and 325 newborns visit our genetic clinic regularly which were regarded as the research object. In the hearing screening, the referral rate for hearing loss in the first-step screening was 13.8% (45/325), and became 9.2% (30/325) upon retesting. Nine newborns (2. 8%) were diagnosed as hearing loss of different degrees as early as 3 months old,including 6 homozygous/compound heterozygote and 3 heterozygotes. Patients with GJB2 mutations have various phenotype. Newborns with homozygous/compound heterozygous GJB2 mutations may pass the hearing screening at first. Carriers of GJB2 may also have hearing problems. The combination of genetic and audiological screening can play an important role in deafness detections of infants before key period of speech development.	4
Evidence for phenotypic plasticity in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer: human biology is recapitulated by a novel model system. || Adult Animals Bone Marrow Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Culture Media, Serum-Free Cytogenetics Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Exons Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Karyotyping Mice Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Transplantation Phenotype Prognosis || Breast cancers with a basal-like gene signature are primarily triple-negative, frequently metastatic, and carry a poor prognosis. Basal-like breast cancers are enriched for markers of breast cancer stem cells as well as markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While EMT is generally thought to be important in the process of metastasis, in vivo evidence of EMT in human disease remains rare. Here we report a novel model of human triple-negative breast cancer, the DKAT cell line, which was isolated from an aggressive, treatment-resistant triple-negative breast cancer that demonstrated morphological and biochemical evidence suggestive of phenotypic plasticity in the patient. The DKAT cell line displays a basal-like phenotype in vitro when cultured in serum-free media, and undergoes phenotypic changes consistent with EMT/MET in response to serum-containing media, a unique property among the breast cancer cell lines we tested. This EMT is marked by increased expression of the transcription factor Zeb1, and Zeb1 is required for the enhanced migratory ability of DKAT cells in the mesenchymal state. DKAT cells also express progenitor-cell markers, and single DKAT cells are able to generate tumorspheres containing both epithelial and mesenchymal cell types. In vivo, as few as ten DKAT cells are capable of forming xenograft tumors which display a range of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. The DKAT model provides a novel model to study the molecular mechanisms regulating phenotypic plasticity and the aggressive biology of triple-negative breast cancers.	0
Prediction of dual agents as an activator of mutant p53 and inhibitor of Hsp90 by docking, molecular dynamic simulation and virtual screening. || Amino Acid Motifs Antineoplastic Agents Catalytic Domain Drug Discovery HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins High-Throughput Screening Assays Humans Ligands Molecular Docking Simulation Molecular Dynamics Simulation Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Protein Binding Protein Structure, Secondary Protein Structure, Tertiary Pyrazoles Structure-Activity Relationship Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 User-Computer Interface || Heat shock protein90s (Hsp90s) play a crucial role in the development of cancer, and their inhibitors are a main target for tumor suppression. P53 also is a tumor suppressor, but in cancer cells, mutations in the p53 gene lead to the inactivation and accumulation of protein. For instance, the ninth p53 cancer mutation, Y220C, destabilizes the p53 core domain. Small molecules have been assumed to bind to Y220C DNA-binding domain and reactivate cellular mutant p53 functions. In this study, one of the mutant p53 activators is suggested as an Hsp90 inhibitor according to a pyrazole scaffold. To confirm a new ligand as a dual agent, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were performed on both proteins (p53 and Hsp90). Molecular dynamic simulations were also conducted to evaluate the obtained results on the other two pyrazole structures, one known as Hsp90 inhibitor and the other as the reported mutant p53 activator. The findings indicate that the new ligand was stable in the active site of both proteins. Finally, a virtual screening was performed on ZINC database, and a set of new dual agents was proposed according to the new ligand scaffold.	0
Identification of Novel Somatic TP53 Mutations in Patients with High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) Using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). || Aged Female Frameshift Mutation Humans INDEL Mutation Middle Aged Neoplasms, Cystic, Mucinous, and Serous Ovarian Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Somatic mutations in TP53 are a hallmark of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), although their prognostic and predictive value as markers is not well defined. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can identify novel mutations with high sensitivity, that may be repurposed as potential druggable anti-cancer targets and aid in therapeutic decisions. Here, a commercial NGS cancer panel comprising 26 genes, includingTP53, was used to identify new genetic markers of platinum resistance and patient prognosis in a retrospective set of patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer. Six novelTP53 somatic mutations in untreated tumors from six distinct patients diagnosed with HGSOC were identified:TP53 c.728_739delTGGGCGGCATGA (p.Met243_Met247del, in-frame insertion or deletion (INDEL);TP53 c.795_809delGGGACGGAACAGCTT (p.Gly266_Phe270del, in-frame INDEL);TP53 c.826_827GC>AT (p.Ala276Ile, missense);TP53 c.1022insT (p.Arg342Profs*5, frameshift INDEL);TP53 c.1180delT (p.Ter394Aspfs*28, frameshift INDEL); andTP53 c.573insT (p.Gln192Serfs*17, frameshift INDEL). NovelTP53 variants were validated by classical sequencing methods and their impact on protein expression in tumors explored by immunohistochemistry. Further insights into the potential functional effect of the mutations were obtained by different in silico approaches, bioinformatics tools, and structural modeling. This discovery of previously unreportedTP53 somatic mutations provides an opportunity to translate NGS technology into personalized medicine and identify new potential targets for therapeutic applications.	4
Comparison of the cytotoxicity of cladribine and clofarabine when combined with fludarabine and busulfan in AML cells: Enhancement of cytotoxicity with epigenetic modulators. || Adenine Nucleotides Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Arabinonucleosides Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins Busulfan Cell Line, Tumor Cladribine Clofarabine Epigenesis, Genetic Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Vidarabine || Clofarabine (Clo), fludarabine (Flu), and busulfan (Bu) combinations are efficacious in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myeloid leukemia. We sought to determine whether the more affordable drug cladribine (Clad) can provide a viable alternative to Clo, with or without panobinostat (Pano) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). Both Clad+Flu+Bu and Clo+Flu+Bu combinations showed synergistic cytotoxicity in KBM3/Bu250(6), HL60, and OCI-AML3 cell lines. Cell exposure to these drug combinations resulted in 60%-80% inhibition of proliferation; activation of the ATM pathway; increase in histone modifications; decrease in HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5 and SirT7 proteins; decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential; activation of apoptosis and stress signaling pathways; and downregulation of the AKT pathway. These drug combinations activated DNA-damage response and apoptosis in primary cell samples from AML patients. At lower concentrations of Clad/Clo, Flu, and Bu, inclusion of Pano and DAC enhanced cell killing, increased histone modifications and DNA demethylation, and increased the levels of P16/INK4a, P15/INK4b and P21/Waf1/Cip1 proteins. The observed DNA demethylating activity of Clad and Clo may complement DAC activity; increase demethylation of the gene promoters for SFRP1, DKK3, and WIF1; and cause degradation of β-catenin in cells exposed to Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu+DAC+Pano. The overlapping activities of Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu, Pano, and DAC in DNA-damage formation and repair, histone modifications, DNA demethylation, and apoptosis may underlie their synergism. Our results provide a basis for supplanting Clo with Clad and for including epigenetic modifiers in the pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimen for myeloid leukemia patients.	0
Novel clinicopathological and molecular characterization of metanephric adenoma: a study of 28 cases. || Adenoma Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Biopsy China DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Kidney Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Retrospective Studies Transcriptome || Metanephric adenoma is a rare, benign renal neoplasm with occasional misdiagnosis. However, its molecular characterization is not fully understood. In this study, we use the hybrid capture-based Next-Generation Sequencing to sequence a panel of 295 well-established oncogene or tumor suppressor genes in 28 cases of MA patients in China. Novel clinicopathological markers associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in metanephric adenoma were detected by immunohistochemistry. It was found that except for BRAF (22/28) mutations (c.1799 T > A, p.V600E), NF1 (6/28), NOTCH1 (5/28), SPEN (5/28), AKT2 (4/28), APC (4/28), ATRX (3/28), and ETV4 (3/28) mutations could also be detected. Meanwhile, a novel and rare gene fusion of STARD9-BRAF, CUX1-BRAF, and LOC100507389-BRAF was detected in one MA patient. In addition, although MEK phosphorylation was normally activated, the phosphorylation level of ERK was low in metanephric adenoma cases. Highly expressed p16 and DUSP6 may have contributed to these results, which maintained MA as a benign renal tumor. This study provides novel molecular and pathological markers for metanephric adenoma, which could improve its diagnosis and increase the understanding of its pathologic mechanism.	4

Frequencies of the most common mutations responsible for phenylketonuria in Poland. || Alleles Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation Neonatal Screening Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Poland || We screened 91 Polish phenylketonuric (PKU) children for the presence of 18 common mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, and 75.7% of PAH alleles were identified. The R408W mutation accounted for 54.9% of PAH mutant alleles. In the other 20.8%, eight mutations were detected: R158Q (6.6%), IVS10 (4.9%), IVS12 (2.7%), R261Q (2.2%), G272ter (1.65%), Y414C (1.1%), R252W (1.1%) and P281L (0.54%). Correlations between genotype and clinical phenotype were described.	1 3
Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia: next-generation sequencing allows for a safer, more accurate, and comprehensive approach. || Achondroplasia Biomarkers DNA False Negative Reactions Female Genetic Markers Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Maternal Serum Screening Tests Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Pregnancy Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Retrospective Studies Sequence Analysis, DNA Thanatophoric Dysplasia || Accurate prenatal diagnosis of genetic conditions can be challenging and usually requires invasive testing. Here, we demonstrate the potential of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal blood to transform prenatal diagnosis of monogenic disorders. Analysis of cell-free DNA using a PCR and restriction enzyme digest (PCR-RED) was compared with a novel NGS assay in pregnancies at risk of achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia. PCR-RED was performed in 72 cases and was correct in 88.6%, inconclusive in 7% with one false negative. NGS was performed in 47 cases and was accurate in 96.2% with no inconclusives. Both approaches were used in 27 cases, with NGS giving the correct result in the two cases inconclusive with PCR-RED. NGS provides an accurate, flexible approach to non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of de novo and paternally inherited mutations. It is more sensitive than PCR-RED and is ideal when screening a gene with multiple potential pathogenic mutations. These findings highlight the value of NGS in the development of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis for other monogenic disorders.	4
Prevalence and range of GJB2 and SLC26A4 mutations in patients with autosomal recessive non‑syndromic hearing loss. ||  || The frequency and distribution of genetic mutations that cause deafness differ significantly according to ethnic group and region. Zhejiang is a province in the southeast of China, with an exceptional racial composition of the population caused by mass migration in ancient China. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of gap junction‑β2 (GJB2), solute carrier family 26 (anion exchanger) member 4 (SLC26A4) and GJB3 mutations in patients with autosomal recessive non‑syndromic hearing loss (ARNHL) in this area. A total of 176 unrelated pediatric patients with ARNHL were enrolled in the study. A genomic DNA sample was extracted from the peripheral blood. Polymerase chain reaction was employed, and the products were sequenced to screen for mutations in GJB2. In addition, a SNaPshot sequencing method was utilized to detect four hotspot mutations in SLC26A4 (IVS7‑2A>G and c.2168A>G) and GJB3 (c.538C>T and c.547G>A). All patients were subjected to a temporal bone computed tomography scan to identify enlarged vestibular aqueducts (EVA). In total, 14 different mutations, including two new mutations (p.W44L and p.D66N) of GJB2, were detected. The most common pathogenic mutation of GJB2 was c.235delC (15.1%), followed by c.176_191del16 (1.7%), c.299_300delAT (1.7%), c.508_511dup (0.85%) and c.35delG (0.28%) of the total alleles. Mutation analysis of SLC26A4 demonstrated that 13.6% (24/176) of patients carried at least one mutant allele. The patients with EVA (84.2%) had SLC26A4 mutations, and 31% had homozygous mutations. Only one patient carried a heterozygous mutation of GJB3 (c.538C>T). Compared with the other regions of China, in the present population cohort, the prevalence and spectrum of mutations in GJB2 was unique, and in patients with EVA the frequency of a homozygous mutation in SLC26A4 was significantly lower. These findings may be of benefit in genetic counseling and risk assessment for families from this area of China.	1
Infantile-onset Pompe disease with neonatal debut: A case report and literature review. || Biopsy, Needle Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Disease Progression Fatal Outcome Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Homozygote Humans Immunohistochemistry Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases Male Mutation Rare Diseases Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index Ventricular Fibrillation alpha-Glucosidases || Infantile-onset Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II, is a progressive and fatal disorder without treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enhances survival; however, the best outcomes have been achieved with early treatment. We report a case of a newborn with infantile-onset Pompe disease diagnosed in the first days of life who did not undergo universal neonatal screening. The patient was asymptomatic, with a general physical examination revealing only a murmur. The clinical presentation was dominated by the neonatal detection of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, without hypotonia or macroglossia. Pompe disease was confirmed in the first week of life by GAA activity in dried blood spots, and a GAA genetic study showed the homozygous mutation p.Arg854X. Parents initially refused replacement therapy. The patient experienced recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation during central line placement and could not be resuscitated. Although Pompe disease is rare, and universal screening has not been established, neonatologists should be alerted to the diagnosis of Pompe in the presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is achieved in a few days with the aid of dried blood spots.	1
TP53 and RET may serve as biomarkers of prognostic evaluation and targeted therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Exome Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Liver Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Niacinamide Phenylurea Compounds Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret Sequence Analysis, DNA Sorafenib Survival Analysis Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy of the liver. Genomic analysis is conducted to identify genetic alterations in driver genes which are all druggable targets for cancer therapy. In the present study, we performed an exome sequencing of 45 driver genes in 100 paired samples from HCC patients including tumors and matched adjacent normal tissues using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Non-synonymous mutations were ascertained using the iPLEX MassARRAY system and Sanger sequencing. Clinicopathological relevance with genetic variations was assessed using SPSS software. The prognostic analyses of patients with gene mutation status were summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves. Sixty-one non-synonymous somatic mutations were identified in 43% of the HCC patients. The most frequent mutations were: TP53 (20%), RET (6%), PLCE1 (5%), PTEN (4%) and VEGFR2 (3%). Patients with mutations in TP53 had a lower overall survival (OS) (P=0.002) than those without mutations. Recurrent mutations in the Ret proto‑oncogene (RET) were associated with poor outcomes for both disease‑free survival (DFS) (P=0.028) and OS (P=0.001) in HCC patients. The mutational status of sorafenib-targeted genes were associated with decreased DFS (P=0.039), and decreased OS (P=0.15) without statistical significance. Mutual exclusion of TP53 and RET mutations were observed in the present study. In conclusion, patients with TP53 mutations, RET mutations and sorafenib-targeted gene mutations were demonstrated to be associated with poor HCC prognosis, which suggests that both TP53 and RET may serve as biomarkers of prognostic evaluation and targeted therapy in HCC.	4
Muscle MRI Findings in Childhood/Adult Onset Pompe Disease Correlate with Muscle Function. || Adult Aged Child Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Muscle Strength Muscles Respiration Whole Body Imaging Young Adult || Enzyme replacement therapy has shown to be effective for childhood/adult onset Pompe disease (AOPD). The discovery of biomarkers useful for monitoring disease progression is one of the priority research topics in Pompe disease. Muscle MRI could be one possible test but the correlation between muscle MRI and muscle strength and function has been only partially addressed so far. We studied 34 AOPD patients using functional scales (Manual Research Council scale, hand held myometry, 6 minutes walking test, timed to up and go test, time to climb up and down 4 steps, time to walk 10 meters and Motor Function Measure 20 Scale), respiratory tests (Forced Vital Capacity seated and lying, Maximun Inspiratory Pressure and Maximum Expiratory Pressure), daily live activities scales (Activlim) and quality of life scales (Short Form-36 and Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life questionnaire). We performed a whole body muscle MRI using T1w and 3-point Dixon imaging centered on thighs and lower trunk region. T1w whole body muscle MRI showed a homogeneous pattern of muscle involvement that could also be found in pre-symptomatic individuals. We found a strong correlation between muscle strength, muscle functional scales and the degree of muscle fatty replacement in muscle MRI analyzed using T1w and 3-point Dixon imaging studies. Moreover, muscle MRI detected mild degree of fatty replacement in paraspinal muscles in pre-symptomatic patients. Based on our findings, we consider that muscle MRI correlates with muscle function in patients with AOPD and could be useful for diagnosis and follow-up in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic patients under treatment. Muscle MRI correlates with muscle function in patients with AOPD and could be useful to follow-up patients in daily clinic.	1
An <i>in silico</i> approach in predicting the possible mechanism involving restoration of wild-type p53 functions by small molecular weight compounds in tumor cells expressing R273H mutant p53. || DNA-binding domain R273H mutant p53 alpinetin curcumin flavokawain B molecular docking simulation || R273H mutant p53 is a DNA-contact mutant that renders p53 dysfunctional due to a single substitution of Arg273 for His273. Rescuing R273 mutant p53 implies that a competent molecule would have to bind to the site of DNA-contact hot spots to complement the loss of contact with the DNA-binding domain. Here, curcumin, flavokawain B, and alpinetin were docked against the crystal structure of R273H mutant p53 <i>in silico</i>. Consequently, all the compounds bind to the cavity of R273H mutant p53 with a dissociation constant estimated to have 36.57, 70.77, and 75.11 µM for curcumin, flavokawain B, and alpinetin, respectively. Subsequently, each molecule was able to bind to the R273H mutant p53 by interacting with the DNA-contact hot spot Arg248 and mutant R273H, thereby compensating for the loss of direct contact with the DNA-binding domain. Furthermore, all the molecules were able to induce a direct contact with the consensus site of the DNA binding domain, thus maintaining DNA-contact residues with the DNA. The present findings offer preliminary indirect supporting evidence that small molecular weight compounds may certainly rescue DNA-contact mutant p53, which may lay a foundation for designing a competent and effective molecule capable of rescuing mutant p53 in tumor cells expressing R273H mutant p53.	0
PIK3CA, HRAS and KRAS gene mutations in human penile cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases DNA Mutational Analysis Genes, ras Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Mutation, Missense Penile Neoplasms Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || The knowledge of somatic mutations that arise in penile cancer is limited. We examined the dysregulation of components in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras pathways. Using single stranded conformational analysis and direct sequencing we performed mutational analysis of the PIK3CA, PTEN, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes in 28 penile tumors. We identified somatic missense mutations in 11 of the 28 penile cancer samples (39%). In the PIK3CA gene 8 mutations (29%) were identified that were E542K or E545K. In the HRAS gene a G12S and a Q61L mutation were found (7%). The KRAS gene contained 1 mutation (3%), that is a G12S change. PIK3CA mutations were found in all grades and stages, whereas HRAS and KRAS mutations were found in larger and more advanced tumors. The mutations were mutually exclusive, suggesting that dysregulation of either pathway is sufficient for the development and progression of penile carcinoma. The high frequency of mutations in the PIK3CA, HRAS and KRAS genes leads us to believe that dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Ras pathway is significant for the development and progression of penile carcinoma.	4
CPI-17 drives oncogenic Ras signaling in human melanomas via Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin family proteins. || Animals Cell Proliferation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Cytoskeletal Proteins Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HeLa Cells Humans Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mice Microfilament Proteins Myosin-Light-Chain Phosphatase NIH 3T3 Cells Neurofibromin 2 Phosphoprotein Phosphatases Phosphorylation RNA Interference Signal Transduction Skin Neoplasms Time Factors Transfection ras Proteins || Hyperactive Ras signaling has strong oncogenic effects causing several different forms of cancer. Hyperactivity is frequently induced by mutations within Ras itself, which account for up to 30% of all human cancers. In addition, hyperactive Ras signaling can also be triggered independent of Ras by either mutation or by misexpression of various upstream regulators and immediate downstream effectors. We have previously reported that C-kinase potentiated protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor of 17 kDa (CPI-17) can drive Ras activity and promote tumorigenic transformation by inhibition of the tumor suppressor Merlin. We now describe an additional element of this oncogenic mechanism in the form of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) protein family, which exhibits opposing roles in Ras activity control. Thus, CPI-17 drives Ras activity and tumorigenesis in a two-fold way; inactivation of the tumor suppressor merlin and activation of the growth promoting ERM family. The in vivo significance of this oncogenic switch is highlighted by demonstrating CPI-17's involvement in human melanoma pathogenesis.	0
Adaptation and validation of the ACMG/AMP variant classification framework for MYH7-associated inherited cardiomyopathies: recommendations by ClinGen's Inherited Cardiomyopathy Expert Panel. || Alleles Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathies Clinical Decision-Making Expert Testimony Gene Frequency Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Testing Genetic Variation Humans Myosin Heavy Chains Phenotype Reproducibility of Results || PurposeIntegrating genomic sequencing in clinical care requires standardization of variant interpretation practices. The Clinical Genome Resource has established expert panels to adapt the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology classification framework for specific genes and diseases. The Cardiomyopathy Expert Panel selected MYH7, a key contributor to inherited cardiomyopathies, as a pilot gene to develop a broadly applicable approach.MethodsExpert revisions were tested with 60 variants using a structured double review by pairs of clinical and diagnostic laboratory experts. Final consensus rules were established via iterative discussions.ResultsAdjustments represented disease-/gene-informed specifications (12) or strength adjustments of existing rules (5). Nine rules were deemed not applicable. Key specifications included quantitative frameworks for minor allele frequency thresholds, the use of segregation data, and a semiquantitative approach to counting multiple independent variant occurrences where fully controlled case-control studies are lacking. Initial inter-expert classification concordance was 93%. Internal data from participating diagnostic laboratories changed the classification of 20% of the variants (n = 12), highlighting the critical importance of data sharing.ConclusionThese adapted rules provide increased specificity for use in MYH7-associated disorders in combination with expert review and clinical judgment and serve as a stepping stone for genes and disorders with similar genetic and clinical characteristics.	4
Hyperphenylalaninaemias in Estonia: Genotype-Phenotype Correlation and Comparative Overview of the Patient Cohort Before and After Nation-Wide Neonatal Screening. || Hyperphenylalaninaemia PAH variation spectrum Phenylalanine hydroxylase Phenylketonuria Variations in Estonian population || The present study provides a retrospective overview of the cohort of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Estonia. Based on the available data, the patients clearly cluster into two distinct groups: the patients with late diagnosis and start of therapy (N = 46), who were born before 1993 when the national newborn screening programme was launched, and the screened babies (N = 48) getting their diagnoses at least in a couple of weeks after birth.Altogether 153 independent phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) alleles from 92 patients were analysed in the study, wherein 80% of them were carrying the p.Arg408Trp variation, making the relative frequency of this particular variation one of the highest known. Additionally, 15 other different variations in the PAH gene were identified, each with very low incidence, providing ground for phenotypic variability and potential response to BH<sub>4</sub> therapy. Genealogical analysis revealed some "hotspots" of the origin of the p.Arg408Trp variation, with especially high density in South-East Estonia. According to our data, the incidence of PKU in Estonia is estimated as 1 in 6,700 newborns.	1 3

We investigated the germline and somatic mutation spectrum of patients with CRC in Taiwan by using the AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel V2. Fifty paired freshly frozen stage 0-IV CRC tumors and adjacent normal tissue were collected. Blood DNA from 20 healthy donors were used for comparison of germline mutations. Variants were identified using an ion-torrent personal genomic machine and subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing. Five nonsynonymous germline variants on 4 cancer susceptible genes, CDH1, APC, MLH1, and NRAS, were observed in 6 patients with CRC (12%). Among them, oncogene NRAS G138R variant was identified as having a predicted damaging effect on protein function, which has never been reported by other laboratories. CDH1 T340A variants were presented in 3 patients. The germline variants in the cancer patients differed completely from those found in asymptomatic controls. Furthermore, a total of 56 COSMIC and 21 novel somatic variants distributed in 20 genes were detected in 44 (88%) of the CRC samples. High inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity levels were observed. Nine rare variants located in the β-catenin binding region of the APC gene were discovered, 7 of which could cause amino acid frameshift and might have a pathogenic effect. In conclusion, panel-based mutation detection by using a high-throughput sequencing platform can elucidate race-dependent cancer genomes. This approach facilitates identifying individuals at high risk and aiding the recognition of novel mutations as targets for drug development.	4
A systematic analysis reveals heterogeneous changes in the endocytic activities of cancer cells. || CD59 Antigens Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Caveolae Cell Adhesion Cell Line, Tumor Cell Membrane Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Clathrin Collagen Endocytosis Humans Hyaluronan Receptors Lung Neoplasms Neoplasm Invasiveness Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Respiratory Mucosa || Metastasis is a multistep process requiring cancer cell signaling, invasion, migration, survival, and proliferation. These processes require dynamic modulation of cell surface proteins by endocytosis. Given this functional connection, it has been suggested that endocytosis is dysregulated in cancer. To test this, we developed In-Cell ELISA assays to measure three different endocytic pathways: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and clathrin-independent endocytosis and compared these activities using two different syngeneic models for normal and oncogene-transformed human lung epithelial cells. We found that all endocytic activities were reduced in the transformed versus normal counterparts. However, when we screened 29 independently isolated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines to determine whether these changes were systematic, we observed significant heterogeneity. Nonetheless, using hierarchical clustering based on their combined endocytic properties, we identified two phenotypically distinct clusters of NSCLCs. One co-clustered with mutations in KRAS, a mesenchymal phenotype, increased invasion through collagen and decreased growth in soft agar, whereas the second was enriched in cells with an epithelial phenotype. Interestingly, the two clusters also differed significantly in clathrin-independent internalization and surface expression of CD44 and CD59. Taken together, our results suggest that endocytotic alterations in cancer cells that affect cell surface expression of critical molecules have a significant influence on cancer-relevant phenotypes, with potential implications for interventions to control cancer by modulating endocytic dynamics.	0
Activity of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor ganetespib in melanoma. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Down-Regulation ErbB Receptors Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases GTP Phosphohydrolases HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins Humans Immunoblotting Inhibitory Concentration 50 Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mutation Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Receptor, IGF Type 1 Skin Neoplasms Triazoles || Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes such as cell signaling, proliferation and survival, and has been recently recognized as a potential target for cancer therapy. Ganetespib is a potent ATP competitive inhibitor of HSP90. Ganetespib downregulated the expression of multiple signal transducing molecules including EGFR, IGF-1R, c-Met, Akt, B-RAF and C-RAF, resulting in pronounced decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 in a panel of five cutaneous melanoma cell lines including those harboring B-RAF and N-RAS mutations. Ganetespib exhibited potent antiproliferative activity on all five of these cell lines, with IC50 values between 37.5 and 84 nM. Importantly, Ganetespib is active on B-RAF mutated melanoma cells that have acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition. Ganetespib induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 and/or G2/M phase. Ganetespib induced cell cycle arrest was accompanied by altered expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1), cyclins B1, D1 and E, and/or cyclin-dependent kinases 1, 2 and 4. HSP90 is functionally important for melanoma cells and HSP90 inhibitors such as ganetespib could potentially be effective therapeutics for melanoma with various genetic mutations and acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition.	0
Clinical next generation sequencing to identify actionable aberrations in a phase I program. || High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Neoplasms Precision Medicine || We determined the frequency of recurrent hotspot mutations in 46 cancer-related genes across tumor histologies in patients with advanced cancer. We reviewed data from 500 consecutive patients who underwent genomic profiling on an IRB-approved prospective clinical protocol in the Phase I program at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Archival tumor DNA was tested for 740 hotspot mutations in 46 genes (Ampli-Seq Cancer Panel; Life Technologies, CA). Of the 500 patients, 362 had at least one reported mutation/variant. The most common likely somatic mutations were within TP53 (36%), KRAS (11%), and PIK3CA (9%) genes. Sarcoma (20%) and kidney (30%) had the lowest proportion of likely somatic mutations detected, while pancreas (100%), colorectal (89%), melanoma (86%), and endometrial (75%) had the highest. There was high concordance in 62 patients with paired primary tumors and metastases analyzed. 151 (30%) patients had alterations in potentially actionable genes. 37 tumor types were enrolled; both rare actionable mutations in common tumor types and actionable mutations in rare tumor types were identified. Multiplex testing in the CLIA environment facilitates genomic characterization across multiple tumor lineages and identification of novel opportunities for genotype-driven trials.	4
Galectin-3 regulates a molecular switch from N-Ras to K-Ras usage in human breast carcinoma cells. || Animals Breast Neoplasms COS Cells Cell Line, Tumor Cercopithecus aethiops Galectin 3 Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Mutation Protein Isoforms ras Proteins || Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a pleiotropic carbohydrate-binding protein, is a selective binding partner of activated K-Ras-GTP. Because both proteins are antiapoptotic and associated with cancer progression, we questioned the possible functional role of Gal-3 in K-Ras activation. We found that overexpression of Gal-3 in human breast cancer cells (BT-549/Gal-3) coincided with a significant increase in wild-type (wt) K-Ras-GTP coupled with loss in wt N-Ras-GTP, whereas the nononcogenic Gal-3 mutant proteins [Gal-3(S6E) and Gal-3(G182A)] failed to induce the Ras isoform switch. Only wt Gal-3 protein coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with oncogenic K-Ras, resulting in its activation with radical alterations in Ras signaling pathway, whereby the activation of AKT and Ral was suppressed and shifted to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Specific inhibitors for Ras or mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (farnesylthiosalicylic acid and UO126, respectively) inhibited Gal-3-mediated apoptotic resistance and anchorage-independent growth functions. In conclusion, this study shows that Gal-3 confers on BT-549 human breast carcinoma cells several oncogenic functions by binding to and activation of wt K-Ras, suggesting that some of the molecular functions of Gal-3 are, at least in part, a result of K-Ras activation.	0
Gene therapy for the inner ear: challenges and promises. || Gene Expression Regulation Gene Transfer Techniques Genetic Therapy Humans Labyrinth Diseases Mutation Targeted Gene Repair || Since the recognition of genes as the discrete units of heritability, and of DNA as their molecular substrate, the utilization of genes for therapeutic purposes has been recognized as a potential means of correcting genetic disorders. The tools of molecular biology, which allow the manipulation of DNA sequence, provided the means to put this concept into practice. However, progress in the implementation of these ideas has been slow. Here we review the history of the idea of gene therapy and the complexity of genetic disorders. We also discuss the requirements for sequence-based therapy to be accomplished for different types of inherited diseases, as well as the methods available for gene manipulation. The challenges that have limited the applications of gene therapy are reviewed, as are ethical concerns. Finally, we discuss the promise of gene therapy to address inherited and acquired disorders of the inner ear.	4
AZD1775 Increases Sensitivity to Olaparib and Gemcitabine in Cancer Cells with p53 Mutations. ||  || Tumor suppressor p53 is responsible for enforcing cell cycle checkpoints at G1/S and G2/M in response to DNA damage, thereby allowing both normal and tumor cells to repair DNA before entering S and M. However, tumor cells with absent or mutated p53 are able to activate alternative signaling pathways that maintain the G2/M checkpoint, which becomes uniquely critical for the survival of such tumor cells. We hypothesized that abrogation of the G2 checkpoint might preferentially sensitize p53-defective tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents and spare normal cells with intact p53 function. The tyrosine kinase WEE1 regulates cdc2 activity at the G2/M checkpoint and prevents entry into mitosis in response to DNA damage or stalled DNA replication. AZD1775 is a WEE1 inhibitor that overrides and opens the G2/M checkpoint by preventing WEE1-mediated phosphorylation of cdc2 at tyrosine 15. In this study, we assessed the effect of AZD1775 on endometrial and ovarian cancer cells in the presence of two DNA damaging agents, the PARP1 inhibitor, olaparib, and the chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine. We show that AZD1775 alone is effective as a therapeutic agent against some p53 mutated cell models. Moreover, the combination of AZD1775 with olaparib or gemcitabine is synergistic in cells with mutant p53 and constitutes a new approach that should be considered in the treatment of advanced and recurrent gynecologic cancer.	0
KRAS G12C mutation as a poor prognostic marker of pemetrexed treatment in non-small cell lung cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Deoxycytidine Female Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Pemetrexed Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Republic of Korea Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome || The predictive and prognostic value of KRAS mutation and its type of mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are controversial. This clinical study was designed to investigate the predictive value of KRAS mutations and its mutation types to pemetrexed and gemcitabine based treatment. Advanced NSCLC patients tested for KRAS mutation (n = 334) were retrospectively reviewed and 252 patients with wild type epidermal growth factor receptor and no anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion were enrolled for the analysis. KRAS mutations were observed in 45 subjects with mutation type as followed: G12C (n = 13), G12D (n = 12), G12V (n = 12), other (n = 8). Response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of pemetrexed singlet and gemcitabine based chemotherapy were analysis. Age, sex, performance status were well balanced between subjects with or without KRAS mutations. No difference was observed in RR. Hazard ratio (HR) of PFS for pemetrexed treated subjects with G12C mutation compared to subjects with KRAS wild type was 1.96 (95% confidential interval [CI], 1.01 to 3.79; p = 0.045), but other mutations failed to show clinical significance. By analysis done by PFS, compared to the subjects with transition mutation, HR was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.64 to 3.40;p = 0.360) for subjects with transversion mutation on pemetrexed treatment and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.87;p = 0.020) for subjects treated with gemcitabine based chemotherapy. No difference was observed in OS. In this study, different drug sensitivity was observed according to the type of KRAS mutation. NSCLC subpopulations with different KRAS mutation type should be considered as different subgroups and optimal chemotherapy regimens should be searched in further confirmative studies.	4
Caffeine induces sustained apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells by activating the caspase‑9/caspase‑3 signalling pathway. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Caffeine Caspase 3 Caspase 9 Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Enzyme Activation Humans Signal Transduction Stomach Neoplasms || Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed substances found in beverages, and has demonstrated anticancer effects in several types of cancer. The present study aimed to examine the anticancer effects of caffeine on gastric cancer (GC) cells (MGC‑803 and SGC‑7901) in vitro, and to determine whether the apoptosis‑related caspase‑9/-3 pathway is associated with these effects. The sustained antiproliferative effects of caffeine on gastric cancer were also investigated. GC cell viability and proliferation were evaluated using cell counting and colony forming assays, following treatment with various concentrations of caffeine. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell cycle dynamics and apoptosis. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the activity of the caspase‑9/-3 pathway. The results indicated that caffeine treatment significantly suppressed GC cell growth and viability and induced apoptosis by activating the caspase‑9/-3 pathway. Furthermore, the anticancer effects of caffeine appeared to be sustained, as the caspase‑9/-3 pathway remained active following caffeine withdrawal. In conclusion, caffeine may function as a sustained anticancer agent by activating the caspase‑9/-3 pathway, which indicates that it may be useful as a therapeutic candidate in gastric cancer.	0
Amuvatinib has cytotoxic effects against NRAS-mutant melanoma but not BRAF-mutant melanoma. || Apoptosis Cell Culture Techniques Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cohort Studies DNA Damage Genes, ras Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Ligands Melanoma Mutation Proteomics Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Pyrimidines Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Signal Transduction Skin Neoplasms || Effective targeted therapy strategies are still lacking for the 15-20% of melanoma patients whose melanomas are driven by oncogenic NRAS. Here, we report on the NRAS-specific behavior of amuvatinib, a kinase inhibitor with activity against c-KIT, Axl, PDGFRα, and Rad51. An analysis of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines showed the NRAS-mutant cohort to be enriched for targets of amuvatinib, including Axl, c-KIT, and the Axl ligand Gas6. Increasing concentrations of amuvatinib selectively inhibited the growth of NRAS-mutant, but not BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines, an effect associated with induction of S-phase and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, amuvatinib was noted to either inhibit Axl, AKT, and MAPK signaling or Axl and AKT signaling and to induce a DNA damage response. In three-dimensional cell culture experiments, amuvatinib was cytotoxic against NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines. Thus, we show for the first time that amuvatinib has proapoptotic activity against melanoma cell lines, with selectivity observed for those harboring oncogenic NRAS.	0
IDH1/IDH2 but not TP53 mutations predict prognosis in Bulgarian glioblastoma patients. || Brain Neoplasms Bulgaria Chromosome Aberrations Female Genes, p53 Glioblastoma Homozygote Humans Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Kaplan-Meier Estimate Loss of Heterozygosity Male Middle Aged Multivariate Analysis Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Sequence Analysis, DNA Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutations in genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase isoforms 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) have been associated with good prognosis for patients with brain neoplasias and have been commonly found together with mutated TP53 gene. To determine the prevalence of IDH1, IDH2, and TP53 mutations and their impact on overall survival 106 glioblastoma patients were analysed. IDH1 mutations were detected in 13 and IDH2 mutation in one patient. Two homozygous samples with R132H mutation in IDH1 gene and a novel aberration K129R in IDH2 gene were found. Sixty-four percent of IDH1/IDH2 mutated tumours harboured also a mutation in TP53 gene. Genetic aberrations in TP53 were present in 37 patients. Statistical analysis of the impact of the studied factors on the overall survival showed that the mutations in IDH1/IDH2, but not the ones in TP53, were associated with longer survival. Also, the impact of age on prognosis was confirmed. This is the first comprehensive study on glioblastomas in Bulgaria. Our results suggest that IDH1/IDH2 but not TP53 mutations together with other prognostic factors such as age might be applied in clinical practice for prediction of outcome in patients with glioblastomas.	4
Comprehensive genomic analysis identifies pathogenic variants in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) patients in South India. || Adolescent Adult Cohort Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Exome Female Gene Library Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genomics Glycated Hemoglobin A Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Homeodomain Proteins Humans India Male Membrane Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors Sequence Analysis, DNA Sulfonylurea Receptors Young Adult || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an early-onset, autosomal dominant form of non-insulin dependent diabetes. Genetic diagnosis of MODY can transform patient management. Earlier data on the genetic predisposition to MODY have come primarily from familial studies in populations of European origin. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive genomic analysis of 289 individuals from India that included 152 clinically diagnosed MODY cases to identify variants in known MODY genes. Further, we have analyzed exome data to identify putative MODY relevant variants in genes previously not implicated in MODY. Functional validation of MODY relevant variants was also performed. We found MODY 3 (HNF1A; 7.2%) to be most frequently mutated followed by MODY 12 (ABCC8; 3.3%). They together account for ~ 11% of the cases. In addition to known MODY genes, we report the identification of variants in RFX6, WFS1, AKT2, NKX6-1 that may contribute to development of MODY. Functional assessment of the NKX6-1 variants showed that they are functionally impaired. Our findings showed HNF1A and ABCC8 to be the most frequently mutated MODY genes in south India. Further we provide evidence for additional MODY relevant genes, such as NKX6-1, and these require further validation.	4
GCK-MODY diabetes associated with protein misfolding, cellular self-association and degradation. || Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Glucokinase HEK293 Cells Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Octoxynol Protein Conformation Protein Folding Protein Multimerization Proteolysis Proteostasis Deficiencies Reticulocytes || GCK-MODY, dominantly inherited mild fasting hyperglycemia, has been associated with >600 different mutations in the glucokinase (GK)-encoding gene (GCK). When expressed as recombinant pancreatic proteins, some mutations result in enzymes with normal/near-normal catalytic properties. The molecular mechanism(s) of GCK-MODY due to these mutations has remained elusive. Here, we aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms for two such catalytically 'normal' GCK mutations (S263P and G264S) in the F260-L270 loop of GK. When stably overexpressed in HEK293 cells and MIN6 β-cells, the S263P- and G264S-encoded mutations generated misfolded proteins with an increased rate of degradation (S263P>G264S) by the protein quality control machinery, and a propensity to self-associate (G264S>S263P) and form dimers (SDS resistant) and aggregates (partly Triton X-100 insoluble), as determined by pulse-chase experiments and subcellular fractionation. Thus, the GCK-MODY mutations S263P and G264S lead to protein misfolding causing destabilization, cellular dimerization/aggregation and enhanced rate of degradation. In silico predicted conformational changes of the F260-L270 loop structure are considered to mediate the dimerization of both mutant proteins by a domain swapping mechanism. Thus, similar properties may represent the molecular mechanisms for additional unexplained GCK-MODY mutations, and may also contribute to the disease mechanism in other previously characterized GCK-MODY inactivating mutations.	0
Mutations in the low-density-lipoprotein receptor gene in German patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDL), the formation of tendon and skin xanthomata and the development of premature coronary atherosclerosis. It is caused by a defect in the receptor-mediated hepatic uptake of LDL due to mutations in the LDL receptor. In 25 FH families with a total of 160 members and in two individuals without available relatives, all of German origin, we identified LDL receptor mutations by a multiplex-PCR-based single-strand conformation polymorphism method followed by direct sequencing. Of the 24 mutations found, 15 are missense mutations, 2 are nonsense mutations, 4 are small deletions or insertions leading to frameshifts, 2 are an in-frame insertion and deletion, respectively, and one is a splice site mutation. Propositi carrying mutations that are known to completely abolish receptor function (nonsense and frameshift mutations, missense mutation V480M) had significantly higher untreated total and LDL-cholesterol levels compared to those patients carrying missense and in-frame insertion mutations of unknown functional consequence, which may lead to either reduced or completely abolished receptor function (11.30+/-1.64 vs 9.76+/-1.50 mmol/L, and 9.39+/-1.23 vs 7.99+/-1.45 mmol/L, respectively). These results confirm the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of FH and the influence of different functional classes of mutations on lipid values.	4

First-order rate-determining aggregation mechanism of p53 and its implications. || Binding Sites Cross-Linking Reagents Edetic Acid Humans Kinetics Light Mutation Protein Denaturation Protein Folding Protein Structure, Tertiary Scattering, Radiation Temperature Thiazoles Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Aggregation of p53 is initiated by first-order processes that generate an aggregation-prone state with parallel pathways of major or partial unfolding. Here, we elaborate the mechanism and explore its consequences, beginning with the core domain and extending to the full-length p53 mutant Y220C. Production of large light-scattering particles was slower than formation of the Thioflavin T-binding state and simultaneous depletion of monomer. EDTA removes Zn(2+) to generate apo-p53, which aggregated faster than holo-p53. Apo-Y220C also aggregated by both partial and major unfolding. Apo-p53 was not an obligatory intermediate in the aggregation of holo-p53, but affords a parallel pathway that may be relevant to oncogenic mutants with impaired Zn(2+) binding. Full-length tetrameric Y220C formed the Thioflavin T-binding state with similar rate constants to those of core domain, consistent with a unimolecular initiation that is unaffected by neighboring subunits, but very slowly formed small light-scattering particles. Apo-Y220C and aggregated holo-Y220C had little, if any, seeding effect on the initial polymerization of holo-Y220C (measured by Thioflavin T binding), consistent with initiation being a unimolecular process. But apo-Y220C and aggregated holo-Y220C accelerated somewhat the subsequent formation of light-scattering particles from holo-protein, implying coaggregation. The implications for cancer cells containing wild-type and unstable mutant alleles are that aggregation of wild-type p53 (or homologs) might not be seeded by aggregated mutant, but it could coaggregate with p53 or other cellular proteins that have undergone the first steps of aggregation and speed up the formation of microscopically observable aggregates.	0
Kinetic mechanism of p53 oncogenic mutant aggregation and its inhibition. || Amyloid Humans Kinetics Ligands Light Microscopy, Electron Mutation Neoplasms Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Denaturation Protein Folding Scattering, Radiation Thiazoles Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Aggregation of destabilized mutants of the tumor suppressor p53 is a major route for its loss of activity. In order to assay drugs that inhibit aggregation of p53, we established the basic kinetics of aggregation of its core domain, using the mutant Y220C that has a mutation-induced, druggable cavity. Aggregation monitored by light scattering followed lag kinetics. Electron microscopy revealed the formation of small aggregates that subsequently grew to larger amorphous aggregates. The kinetics of aggregation produced surprising results: progress curves followed either by the binding of Thioflavin T or the fluorescence of the protein at 340 nm fitted well to simple two-step sequential first-order lag kinetics with rate constants k(1) and k(2) that were independent of protein concentration, and not to classical nucleation-growth. We suggest a mechanism of first-order formation of an aggregation competent state as being rate determining followed by rapid polymerization with the higher order kinetics. By measuring the inhibition kinetics of k(1) and k(2), we resolved that the process with the higher rate constant followed that of the lower. Further, there was only partial inhibition of k(1) and k(2), which showed two parallel pathways of aggregation, one via a state that requires unfolding of the protein and the other of partial unfolding with the ligand still bound. Inhibition kinetics of ligands provides a useful tool for probing an aggregation mechanism.	0
Clinical effect of point mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes. || Bone Marrow Cells Cytogenetic Analysis DNA Mutational Analysis Genotype Humans Mass Spectrometry Middle Aged Myelodysplastic Syndromes Point Mutation Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Sequence Analysis, DNA Survival Analysis || Myelodysplastic syndromes are clinically heterogeneous disorders characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, impaired differentiation, peripheral-blood cytopenias, and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Somatic mutations may influence the clinical phenotype but are not included in current prognostic scoring systems. We used a combination of genomic approaches, including next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based genotyping, to identify mutations in samples of bone marrow aspirate from 439 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We then examined whether the mutation status for each gene was associated with clinical variables, including specific cytopenias, the proportion of blasts, and overall survival. We identified somatic mutations in 18 genes, including two, ETV6 and GNAS, that have not been reported to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. A total of 51% of all patients had at least one point mutation, including 52% of the patients with normal cytogenetics. Mutations in RUNX1, TP53, and NRAS were most strongly associated with severe thrombocytopenia (P<0.001 for all comparisons) and an increased proportion of bone marrow blasts (P<0.006 for all comparisons). In a multivariable Cox regression model, the presence of mutations in five genes retained independent prognostic significance: TP53 (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 3.84), EZH2 (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.33), ETV6 (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.86), RUNX1 (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.15), and ASXL1 (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.89). Somatic point mutations are common in myelodysplastic syndromes and are associated with specific clinical features. Mutations in TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, and ASXL1 are predictors of poor overall survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, independently of established risk factors.

Mutational analysis of multiple lung cancers: Discrimination between primary and metastatic lung cancers by genomic profile. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Diagnosis, Differential Female Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Neoplasms, Multiple Primary Recurrence Tomography, X-Ray Computed || In cases of multiple lung cancers, individual tumors may represent either a primary lung cancer or both primary and metastatic lung cancers. Treatment selection varies depending on such features, and this discrimination is critically important in predicting prognosis. The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy and validity of mutation analysis as a means of determining whether multiple lung cancers are primary or metastatic in nature. The study involved 12 patients who underwent surgery in our department for multiple lung cancers between July 2014 and March 2016. Tumor cells were collected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of the primary lesions by using laser capture microdissection, and targeted sequencing of 53 lung cancer-related genes was performed. In surgically treated patients with multiple lung cancers, the driver mutation profile differed among the individual tumors. Meanwhile, in a case of a solitary lung tumor that appeared after surgery for double primary lung cancers, gene mutation analysis using a bronchoscopic biopsy sample revealed a gene mutation profile consistent with the surgically resected specimen, thus demonstrating that the tumor in this case was metastatic. In cases of multiple lung cancers, the comparison of driver mutation profiles clarifies the clonal origin of the tumors and enables discrimination between primary and metastatic tumors.	4
High sensitivity of the single-strand conformation polymorphism method for detecting sequence variations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene validated by DNA sequencing. || Base Sequence DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Receptors, LDL Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA || We designed oligonucleotide primer pairs to amplify the promoter region, the translated exon sequences, and the flanking intron sequences of all 18 exons of the LDL receptor gene to compare the ability of the PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method with semiautomated solid-phase genomic DNA sequencing to detect sequence variations. In 20 apparently unrelated Danish patients with a clinical diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), we identified 13 different mutations in the LDL receptor gene: two silent (C331C, N494 N); five missense (W66G, E119K, T383P, W556S, T7051); one nonsense (W23X); three splice-site (313 + 1G-->A, 1061-8T-->C, 1846-1G-->A); and two frameshift (335del10, 1650delG) mutations. Four of these mutations, N494 N, T383P, 1061-8T-->C, and W556S, have not been reported earlier. The pathogenicity of the T383P, 1061-8T-->C, and W556S mutations remains to be established by in vitro mutagenesis and transfection studies. One patient had three mutations (335del10, 1061-8T-->C, and T705I) on the same allele. Further, nine well-known polymorphisms were detectable with this methodological setup. Direct DNA sequencing of the PCR products used for the SSCP analysis did not reveal any sequence variations not detected by the PCR-SSCP method. In two patients we did not detect any mutation by either method. We conclude that the PCR-SSCP analysis, performed as described here, is as sensitive and efficient as DNA sequencing in the ability to identify the sequence variations in the LDL receptor gene of the patients with heterozygous FH of this study.	4
Analysis of EX5del4232ins268 and EX5del955 PAH gene mutations in Ukrainian patients with phenylketonuria. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The major molecular defects causing PKU are missense mutations of PAH gene. Large deletions of exon 5 (EX5del955 and EX5del4232ins) were first reported by the Czech study and were later found also in the Polish, Slovak, Slovenian and Italian PKU-patients. These observations demonstrate the existence of a common subset of this mutation predominantly among Central European populations of Slavic descent. That is why we suggest that EX5del1955 and EX5del4232ins268 mutations might be frequent causes of PKU in Ukrainian patients. EX5del955 and EX5del4232ins268 mutations were analyzed in 106 unrelated PKU patients negative forPAH gene mutations on one or both alleles from our previous analysis. The simultaneous detection of EX5del4232ins268 and EX5del955 mutations was performed by PCR amplification of mutant alleles. EX5del955 mutation was not detected in the Ukrainian patients. This relative alleles frequency of EX5del4232ins268 mutation in the Ukrainian PKU population was determined as 1,66%. Our findings can be the one more evidence of Central European Slavic origin of EX5del4232ins268 mutation, suggested previously. This finding is important for the improvement of DNA diagnosis necessary for the management of PKU patients from Ukraine.	1 3
Molecular Diagnosis Using Residual Liquid-Based Cytology Materials for Patients with Nondiagnostic or Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules. ||  || Molecular analysis for common somatic mutations in thyroid cancer can improve diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the nondiagnostic or indeterminate category of thyroid nodules. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of molecular diagnosis from residual liquid-based cytology (LBC) material after cytological diagnosis. This prospective study enrolled 53 patients with thyroid nodules diagnosed as nondiagnostic, atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) after FNAC. DNAs and RNAs were isolated from residual LBC materials. BRAF(V600E) and RAS point mutations, PAX8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), RET/PTC1, and RET/PTC3 rearrangements were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing. All DNAs from 53 residual LBC samples could be analysed and point mutations were detected in 10 samples (19%). In 17 AUS nodules, seven samples (41%) had point mutations including BRAF (n=4), NRAS (n=2), and KRAS (n=1). In 20 FLUS nodules, three samples (15%) had NRAS point mutations. RNA from only one FLUS nodule could be analysed for rearrangements and there was no abnormality. Molecular analysis for BRAF and RAS mutations was feasible in residual LBC materials and might be useful for diagnosis of indeterminate thyroid nodules.	4
Downregulation of VRK1 by p53 in response to DNA damage is mediated by the autophagic pathway. || Antineoplastic Agents Autophagy Cell Cycle Cells, Cultured DNA Damage Down-Regulation Doxorubicin Etoposide Gene Expression Regulation Gene Knockdown Techniques Humans Infrared Rays Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Membrane Proteins Models, Biological Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Proteins RNA, Small Interfering Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ultraviolet Rays || Human VRK1 induces a stabilization and accumulation of p53 by specific phosphorylation in Thr18. This p53 accumulation is reversed by its downregulation mediated by Hdm2, requiring a dephosphorylated p53 and therefore also needs the removal of VRK1 as stabilizer. This process requires export of VRK1 to the cytosol and is inhibited by leptomycin B. We have identified that downregulation of VRK1 protein levels requires DRAM expression, a p53-induced gene. DRAM is located in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment. Induction of DNA damage by UV, IR, etoposide and doxorubicin stabilizes p53 and induces DRAM expression, followed by VRK1 downregulation and a reduction in p53 Thr18 phosphorylation. DRAM expression is induced by wild-type p53, but not by common human p53 mutants, R175H, R248W and R273H. Overexpression of DRAM induces VRK1 downregulation and the opposite effect was observed by its knockdown. LC3 and p62 were also downregulated, like VRK1, in response to UV-induced DNA damage. The implication of the autophagic pathway was confirmed by its requirement for Beclin1. We propose a model with a double regulatory loop in response to DNA damage, the accumulated p53 is removed by induction of Hdm2 and degradation in the proteasome, and the p53-stabilizer VRK1 is eliminated by the induction of DRAM that leads to its lysosomal degradation in the autophagic pathway, and thus permitting p53 degradation by Hdm2. This VRK1 downregulation is necessary to modulate the block in cell cycle progression induced by p53 as part of its DNA damage response.	0
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9: from the discovery to the development of new therapies for cardiovascular diseases. ||  || The identification of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, has represented a dramatic innovation of the pharmacological modulation of hypercholesterolemia and associated cardiovascular diseases. However, not all patients receiving statins achieve guideline-recommended low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals, particularly those at high risk. There remains, therefore, an unmet medical need to develop additional well-tolerated and effective agents to lower LDL cholesterol levels. The discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a secretory protein that posttranscriptionally regulates levels of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) by inducing its degradation, has opened a new era of pharmacological modulation of cholesterol homeostasis. This paper summarizes the current knowledge of the basic molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory effect of LDLR expression by PCSK9 obtained from in vitro cell-cultured studies and the analysis of the crystal structure of PCSK9. It also describes the epidemiological and experimental evidences of the regulatory effect of PCSK9 on LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular diseases and summarizes the different pharmacological approaches under development for inhibiting PCSK9 expression, processing, and the interaction with LDLR.	4
Phenylketonuria mutations and linked haplotypes in the Lithuanian population: origin of the most common R408W mutation. ||  || A genealogical study was performed in Lithuanian phenylketonuria (PKU) families with the aim of tracing the origins of the R408W/haplotype 2/VNTR3 allele. The relative frequency of six phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) mutations (R408W, R158Q, R261Q, G272X, IVS10nt-11g --> a, and IVS12nt1g --> a) common in Eastern European populations and their association with variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) and short tandem repeat (STR) sites in the PAH gene were examined in 130 PKU Lithuanian chromosomes, including 95 of Baltic, 28 of Slavonic and 7 of unknown origin. R408W was found to be the most frequent (70%) mutation in both Balts or Slavonians with a uniform frequency distribution. No statistically significant differences in the frequency distribution of the other mutations analysed were found. In Balts and Slavonians, the R408W mutation is strongly associated with the three-copy VNTR and the 240-bp STR allele. The frequency of this association is 68% in both ethnic groups. The genealogical data provided in this paper indicate that the most common R408W/VNTR3/STR240 allele arose in ancient times possibly among pre-Indo-Europeans and suggest that the high frequency of the R408W mutation and associated minihaplotype in Balts of Lithuania is due to a founder effect.	1 3
p53-dependent Fas expression is critical for Ginsenoside Rh2 triggered caspase-8 activation in HeLa cells. || Apoptosis Caspase 3 Caspase 8 Caspase 9 Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cytochromes c Enzyme Activation Ginsenosides HeLa Cells Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Mitochondria Protein Transport Receptors, Death Domain Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein bcl-2-Associated X Protein fas Receptor || We have recently reported that Ginsenoside Rh2 (G-Rh2) induces the activation of two initiator caspases, caspase-8 and caspase-9 in human cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of its death-inducing function remains unclear. Here we show that G-Rh2 stimulated the activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 simultaneously in HeLa cells. Under G-Rh2 treatment, membrane death receptors Fas and TNFR1 are remarkably upregulated. However, the induced expression of Fas but not TNFR1 was contributed to the apoptosis process. Moreover, significant increases in Fas expression and caspase-8 activity temporally coincided with an increase in p53 expression in p53-non-mutated HeLa and SK-HEP-1 cells upon G-Rh2 treatment. In contrast, Fas expression and caspase-8 activity remained constant with G-Rh2 treatment in p53-mutated SW480 and PC-3 cells. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 diminished G-Rh2-induced Fas expression and caspase-8 activation. These results indicated that G-Rh2-triggered extrinsic apoptosis relies on p53-mediated Fas over-expression. In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, G-Rh2 induced strong and immediate translocation of cytosolic BAK and BAX to the mitochondria, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and subsequent caspase-9 activation both in HeLa and in SW480 cells. p53-mediated Fas expression and subsequent downstream caspase-8 activation as well as p53-independent caspase-9 activation all contribute to the activation of the downstream effector caspase-3/-7, leading to tumor cell death. Taken together, we suggest that G-Rh2 induces cancer cell apoptosis in a multi-path manner and is therefore a promising candidate for anti-tumor drug development.	0

Here we studied 60 RMSs using whole-exome/-transcriptome sequencing, copy number (CN) and DNA methylome analyses to unravel the genetic/epigenetic basis of RMS. On the basis of methylation patterns, RMS is clustered into four distinct subtypes, which exhibits remarkable correlation with mutation/CN profiles, histological phenotypes and clinical behaviours. A1 and A2 subtypes, especially A1, largely correspond to alveolar histology with frequent PAX3/7 fusions and alterations in cell cycle regulators. In contrast, mostly showing embryonal histology, both E1 and E2 subtypes are characterized by high frequency of CN alterations and/or allelic imbalances, FGFR4/RAS/AKT pathway mutations and PTEN mutations/methylation and in E2, also by p53 inactivation. Despite the better prognosis of embryonal RMS, patients in the E2 are likely to have a poor prognosis. Our results highlight the close relationships of the methylation status and gene mutations with the biological behaviour in RMS.	4
Mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and its clinical implications in two Japanese patients with non-phenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia. || Adolescent DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genotype Humans Japan Male Mass Screening Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || We describe a mutation analysis for the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and the clinical outcome of two Japanese patients with non-phenylketonuria (PKU) hyperphenylalaninemia (serum phenylalanine level below 600 mumol/l under a free diet) detected by a mass-screening program. Single strand conformation polynorphism analysis and direct sequencing of their genomic DNAs revealed that non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia resulted from compound heterozygosity for a mutation causing classical PKU and a mutation with a milder effect on phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. The mutations were R241C and R243Q in exon 7, and R413P in exon 12. The mutation genotypes of the two patients were R241C/R243Q and R241C/R413P. It has been demonstrated that homozygosity for the R243Q or R413P mutation is associated with a severe phenotype of PKU and low in vitro expression activity. In contrast, the R241C mutation has much less effect on phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. The metabolic consequence of each variant allele was confirmed by a phenylalanine loading test in the patients and their parents. The patients achieved normal results in all intellectual and neurologic tests. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed no abnormalities. The dietary restriction was continued until 10 years of age in order to maintain the serum phenylalanine level below 400 mumol/l. The genetic analysis to distinguish non-PKU hyper-phenylalaninemia from classical PKU helps to determine the principles of dietary management in the early infantile period.	3
Variants of the CDH1 (E-Cadherin) Gene Associated with Oral Clefts in the Thai Population. || Antigens, CD Base Sequence Cadherins Case-Control Studies Cleft Lip Cleft Palate Exome Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Analysis Thailand || The etiology of oral clefts in humans is genetically complex and mutations in multiple genes have been linked with clefting. CDH1 (E-cadherin) has been found to be involved in lip and palate development, and CDH1 mutations are associated with oral clefts in some populations. To determine if there is an association between CDH1 and oral clefting in a Thai population, we sequenced the entire 6.5-kb coding region of the CDH1 gene in 80 oral cleft patients and compared the identified variants with those found in 138 unrelated Thai individuals who did not have oral clefts, as genotyped by exome sequencing. Among the oral cleft patients, four nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs), c.1235T>C (p.V412A), c.1273G>A (p.V425I), c.1565C>T (p.T522I), and c.1888C>G (p.L630V), were identified. Only one nonsynonymous variant (c.1409C>T; p.T470I) was found among the 138 noncleft exomes. The frequency of nonsynonymous SNVs on the CDH1 gene in oral cleft patients (4/80) was significantly higher than that in the control group (1/138) (p = 0.042). We found that nonsynonymous variants of CDH1 were associated with oral clefts in the Thai population.	4
Population genetics of hyperphenylalaninaemia resulting from phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in Portugal. || DNA Mutational Analysis Genetics, Population Haplotypes Humans Infant, Newborn Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Portugal || In order to elucidate the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in Portugal, a detailed study of the Portuguese mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genes was performed. A total of 222 mutant alleles from 111 PKU families were analysed for 26 mutations and restriction fragment length polymorphismlvariable number tandem repeat (RFLP/VNTR) haplotypes. It was possible to characterise 55% of the mutant alleles, in which 14 different mutations (R261Q, V388M, IVS10nt-11, I65T, P281L, R252W, R158Q, L348V, Y414C, L311P, Y198fsdel22bp, R408W, R270K, and R261X) and three polymorphisms (Q232Q, V245V, and L385L) were identified. A total of 14 different haplotypes were observed, with a high prevalence of haplotype 1 among mutant and normal alleles. The results reported in this study show considerable genetic heterogeneity in the Portuguese PKU population, as has also been described for other southern European populations.	3
Clinical, biological, and imaging features of monogenic Alzheimer's Disease. || Alzheimer Disease Amyloid beta-Peptides Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor Biomarkers Dementia Diagnosis, Differential Humans Mutation Presenilin-1 Presenilin-2 tau Proteins || The discovery of monogenic forms of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) associated with mutations within PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes is giving a big contribution in the understanding of the underpinning mechanisms of this complex disorder. Compared with sporadic form, the phenotype associated with monogenic cases is somewhat broader including behavioural disturbances, epilepsy, myoclonus, and focal presentations. Structural and functional imaging show typical early changes also in presymptomatic monogenic carriers. Amyloid imaging and CSF tau/A β ratio may be useful in the differential diagnosis with other neurodegenerative dementias, especially, in early onset cases. However, to date any specific biomarkers of different monogenic cases have been identified. Thus, in clinical practice, the early identification is often difficult, but the copresence of different elements could help in recognition. This review will focus on the clinical and instrumental markers useful for the very early identification of AD monogenic cases, pivotal in the development, and evaluation of disease-modifying therapy.	4
Prevalence of Pompe disease in 3,076 patients with hyperCKemia and limb-girdle muscular weakness. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Creatine Kinase Dried Blood Spot Testing Female Germany Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged Muscular Dystrophies, Limb-Girdle Mutation Phenotype Prevalence United Kingdom Young Adult alpha-Glucosidases || We prospectively screened a large European cohort of patients presenting with hyperCKemia and/or limb-girdle muscular weakness (LGMW) for acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency by dried blood spot (DBS) investigation. DBS were collected from 3,076 consecutive adult patients from 7 German and British neuromuscular centers. All specimens were investigated for GAA deficiency by fluorometry. Samples with reduced enzyme activity were subsequently investigated for GAA gene mutations. Of 3,076 patients with DBS samples, 232 patients (7.6%) showed low GAA enzyme activity. Of these 232 patients, 55 (24%) presented with isolated hyperCKemia and 176 (76%) with hyperCKemia and LGMW. With both features present, 94% of the patients showed a low enzymatic activity. Mutational analysis found GAA gene mutations in 74 patients (2.4%); herein 70 patients were heterozygote for the common GAA gene splice-site mutation c.-32-13T>G. The most common clinical presentation in the confirmed Pompe cohort was a limb-girdle phenotype (85.3%) combined with ventilatory insufficiency (61%). Isolated hyperCKemia was found in 12%, while 2.7 had hyperCKemia and ventilatory insufficiency only. In a large cohort of unselected adult patients with hyperCKemia and/or LGMW, we found a prevalence of late-onset Pompe disease of 2.4%. Therefore, targeted screening of such a population should be encouraged in clinical practice.	1
Co-expression of different subunits of human phenylalanine hydroxylase: evidence of negative interallelic complementation. || Alleles Cells, Cultured Gene Expression Regulation Genetic Complementation Test Humans Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Protein Subunits || To study the interaction between two different subunits of the heteromeric human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH), present in hyperphenylalaninemic (HPA) compound heterozygous patients, heteroallelic hPAH enzymes were produced. A dual vector expression system was used (PRO Bacterial Expression System) in which each mutant subunit was expressed from a separate compatible vector, with different epitope tags, in a single bacterial host. Experimental conditions were selected in order that each plasmid produced equivalent levels of mutant subunits. In this study, we demonstrated that both subunits were expressed and that the purified heteroallelic enzymes, were catalytically active. As expected, the produced proteins displayed enzymatic activities levels lower than the predicted catalytic activity, calculated by averaging in vitro PAH activities from both alleles, and were strongly dependent on the proteins subunit composition. The obtained data suggest that interactions between the studied hPAH subunits, namely the I65T, R261Q, R270K and V388M, and the wild-type protein occurred. As postulated, this phenomenon could be a source of phenotypic variation in genetic diseases involving multimeric proteins.	0
Co-occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia in a neonate with Noonan syndrome, leading to premature death. ||  || We report a case of a neonate with Noonan syndrome presenting with concurrent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which resulted in premature death. Cases with Noonan syndrome diagnosed during the neonatal period might not necessarily show mild clinical course, and premature death is a possible outcome to be considered.	4
Genotypes of 2579 patients with phenylketonuria reveal a high rate of BH4 non-responders in Russia. ||  || Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is responsible for most cases of phenylketonuria (PKU). Furthermore, numerous studies on BH4-sensitive PAH deficiency have been conducted. To date, BH4, a cofactor of PAH, has not been used to treat PKU in Russia.Genotype data of patients with PKU can be used to predict their sensitivity to BH4 therapy. A cohort of 2579 patients with PKU from Russia was analyzed for 25 common PAH gene mutations using custom allele-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification-based technology. A mutation detection rate of 84.1% chromosomes was accomplished. Both pathogenic alleles were identified in 73.1% of patients. The most frequent pathogenic variants were p.Arg408Trp (50.9%), p.Arg261Gln (5.3%), p.Pro281Leu (3.5%), IVS12+1G>A (3.1%), IVS10-11G>A (2.6%), and p.Arg158Leu (2.4%). The exact boundaries of a PAH exon 5 deletion were defined as EX5del4154ins268 (c.442-2913_509+1173del4154ins268). Severe phenotypes prevailed in the cohort, and classical PKU was observed in 71.8% cases. Due to the genotype-based prediction, 55.9% of the probands were non-responders to the BH4-treatment, and 20.2% were potential responders. Analysis of genotype data is useful to predict BH4 response in PKU patients. The high rate of non-responders among Russian patients was due to the high allele frequency of severe PAH mutations.	1 3
An oxygraphic method for determining kinetic properties and catalytic mechanism of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. || Amino Acid Substitution Animals Biopterin Electrodes Humans Kinetics Oxygen Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Tyrosine || We have developed a simple and versatile oxygraphic assay procedure that can be used for determination of kinetic constants and enzyme reaction mechanisms of wild-type and mutant aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. The oxygen concentration and rate of oxygen consumption were measured continuously throughout the enzyme reaction, while aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at regular intervals for measurement of other substrates and products. Using (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin as electron donor in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) reaction, a stable stoichiometry of 1:1 was obtained between the amount of oxygen consumed and the tyrosine formation. In comparison, low and variable coupling efficiency values between oxygen consumption and tyrosine formation were found using the parent unsubstituted tetrahydropterin. The application of this assay procedure to study mechanisms of disease-associated mutations was also demonstrated. Thus, the phenylketonuria-associated PAH mutant R158Q had a coupling efficiency of about 80%, compared to the wild-type enzyme under similar conditions. Furthermore, the amount of H(2)O(2) produced in the reaction catalyzed by R158Q PAH was about four times higher than the amount produced by the wild-type PAH, demonstrating a possible pathogenetic mechanism of the mutant enzyme.	0
Novel DNA binding of p53 mutants and their role in transcriptional activation. || Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence Cell Line DNA-Binding Proteins Gene Expression Regulation Genes, p53 Humans In Vitro Techniques Molecular Sequence Data Oligodeoxyribonucleotides Point Mutation RNA, Messenger Structure-Activity Relationship Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The protein product of the normal p53 gene binds to the DNA p53CON element (GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC, Funk et al., 1992), thereby activating transcription from adjacent promoters. Two mutants, 248 (Arg-->Trp) and 281 (Asp-->Gly), failed to bind p53CON and to activate transcription. However, in contrast to previous reports that all p53 mutants fail to bind to the other p53 binding elements, two p53 mutants, 143 (Val-->Ala) and 273 (Arg-->His), retained both p53CON binding and transcriptional activation functions. A third mutant 175 (Arg-->His) bound to the p53CON but did not activate transcription. These data suggest that the DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions of p53 mutants in tumor cells are dependent on the specific missense mutations acquired in the p53 gene and the target sequences of p53 in the genome.	0
SF3B1 and EIF1AX mutations occur in primary leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms; yet another similarity to uveal melanomas. || Adult Aged DNA Mutational Analysis Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-1 Female Humans Male Melanocytes Melanoma Meningeal Neoplasms Middle Aged Mutation Phosphoproteins RNA Splicing Factors Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear Tumor Suppressor Proteins Ubiquitin Thiolesterase Uveal Neoplasms Young Adult || Like uveal melanomas, primary leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms (LMNs) frequently carry GNAQ and GNA11 mutations. However, it is currently unknown whether these LMNs harbor mutations in BAP1, SF3B1 and/or EIF1AX like uveal melanomas as well. In this study, we used Sanger sequencing for the detection of mutations in SF3B1 (hotspots in exon 14 and 15) and EIF1AX (exon 1 and 2 and flanking intronic regions) in a series of 24 primary LMNs. Additionally, BAP1 immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate marker for the detection of inactivating mutations in the BAP1 gene. Mutations in either SF3B1 or EIF1AX were identified in 8 out of 24 primary LMNs (33 %). The presence of these mutations was mutually exclusive and occurred in primary LMNs of different malignancy grades (melanocytomas, intermediate-grade melanocytic tumors, melanomas). Complete absence of nuclear BAP1 staining as is typically seen in BAP1-mutated tumors was not observed. Our finding that an SF3B1 or EIF1AX mutation is present in a substantial subset of primary LMNs underscores that these tumors genetically resemble uveal melanoma and are different from cutaneous melanoma at the genetic level. This information may not only aid in the differential diagnosis of primary versus metastatic melanocytic tumor in/around the central nervous system, but also in the identification of more promising therapeutic approaches targeting the molecular pathways involved in the oncogenesis of LMNs. As none of the primary LMNs in our series showed complete loss of nuclear BAP1 protein, it is unlikely that BAP1 mutations are frequent in these tumors but the role of this gene warrants further investigation.	4
Colorectal Cancer Genetic Heterogeneity Delineated by Multi-Region Sequencing. || Aged Colorectal Neoplasms Female Genetic Heterogeneity High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans INDEL Mutation Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Metastasis Phylogeny Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Analysis, DNA || Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) leads to an underestimation of the mutational landscape portrayed by a single needle biopsy and consequently affects treatment precision. The extent of colorectal cancer (CRC) genetic ITH is not well understood in Chinese patients. Thus, we conducted deep sequencing by using the OncoGxOne™ Plus panel, targeting 333 cancer-specific genes in multi-region biopsies of primary and liver metastatic tumors from three Chinese CRC patients. We determined that the extent of ITH varied among the three cases. On average, 65% of all the mutations detected were common within individual tumors. KMT2C aberrations and the NCOR1 mutation were the only ubiquitous events. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the tumors evolved in a branched manner. Comparison of the primary and metastatic tumors revealed that PPP2R1A (E370X), SETD2 (I1608V), SMAD4 (G382T), and AR splicing site mutations may be specific to liver metastatic cancer. These mutations might contribute to the initiation and progression of distant metastasis. Collectively, our analysis identified a substantial level of genetic ITH in CRC, which should be considered for personalized therapeutic strategies.	4
Associations between APOE and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol genotypes and cognitive and physical capability: the HALCyon programme. || Adult Aging Alzheimer Disease Apolipoprotein E4 Cholesterol, LDL Cognition DNA Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Male Middle Aged Phenotype Polymorphism, Genetic Prospective Studies Time Factors Walking || The APOE ε2/3/4 genotype has been associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and Alzheimer disease. However, evidence for associations with measures of cognitive performance in adults without dementia has been mixed, as it is for physical performance. Associations may also be evident in other genotypes implicated in LDL-C levels. As part of the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course (HALCyon) collaborative research programme, genotypic information was obtained for APOE ε2/3/4, rs515135 (APOB), rs2228671 (LDLR) and rs629301 (SORT1) from eight cohorts of adults aged between 44 and 90 + years. We investigated associations with four measures of cognitive (word recall, phonemic fluency, semantic fluency and search speed) and physical capability (grip strength, get up and go/walk speed, timed chair rises and ability to balance) using meta-analyses. Overall, little evidence for associations between any of the genotypes and measures of cognitive capability was observed (e.g. pooled beta for APOE ε4 effect on semantic fluency z score = -0.02; 95 % CI = -0.05 to 0.02; p value = 0.3; n = 18,796). However, there was borderline evidence within studies that negative effects of APOE ε4 on nonverbal ability measures become more apparent with age. Few genotypic associations were observed with physical capability measures. The findings from our large investigation of middle-aged to older adults in the general population suggest that effects of APOE on cognitive capability are at most modest and are domain- and age-specific, while APOE has little influence on physical capability. In addition, other LDL-C-related genotypes have little impact on these traits.	4
Prevalence of Pro250Arg mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 in coronal craniosynostosis. || Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Craniosynostoses Female Heterozygote Humans Infant Male Pedigree Point Mutation Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor || The C749G (Pro250Arg) mutation in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has been found in patients with various types of craniosynostosis. We aimed to find out the proportion of cases of apparently non-syndromic coronal craniosynostosis attributable to this mutation. We studied 26 patients with coronal craniosynostosis but no syndromic diagnosis, who were referred to a supra-regional specialist centre. Genomic DNA was analysed by PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to identify the C749G mutation in FGFR3. Family members of patients found to have the mutation were also tested. Eight (31%) of the 26 probands were heterozygous for the C749G mutation. In two cases, the mutation showed autosomal dominant transmission with evidence of variable expressivity; the remaining six cases were sporadic. We demonstrated in six families that the mutation had arisen de novo from clinically unaffected parents. The C749G mutation in FGFR3 is a frequent cause of apparently non-syndromic coronal craniosynostosis. Our finding will aid genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. The mutation rate at this nucleotide is one of the highest described in the human genome.	4
The variable phenotype and low-risk nature of RAS-positive thyroid nodules. || Biopsy, Fine-Needle Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Prospective Studies Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Statistics as Topic Thyroid Gland Thyroid Neoplasms Thyroid Nodule Ultrasonography ras Proteins || Oncogenic mutations are common in thyroid cancers. While the frequently detected RAS-oncogene mutations have been studied for diagnostic use in cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules, no investigation has studied such mutations in an unselected population of thyroid nodules. No long-term study of RAS-positive thyroid nodules has been performed. We performed a prospective, blinded cohort study in 362 consecutive patients presenting with clinically relevant (>1 cm) thyroid nodules. Fine needle aspiration cytology and mutational testing were obtained for all nodules. Post-operative histopathology was obtained for malignant or indeterminate nodules, and benign nodules were sonographically followed. Histopathological features were compared between RAS- and BRAF-positive malignancies. RAS-positive benign nodules were analyzed for growth or cellular change from prior aspirations. Overall, 17 of 362 nodules were RAS-positive. Nine separate nodules were BRAF-positive, of which eight underwent surgery and all proved malignant (100%). Out of the 17 RAS-positive nodules, ten underwent surgery, of which eight proved malignant (47%). All RAS-positive malignancies were low risk - all follicular variants of papillary carcinoma, without extrathyroidal extension, metastases, or lymphovascular invasion. RAS-positivity was associated with malignancy in younger patients (P = 0.028). Of the nine RAS-positive benign nodules, five had long-term prospective sonographic follow-up (mean 8.3 years) showing no growth or signs of malignancy. Four of these nodules also had previous aspirations (mean 5.8 years prior), all with similar benign results. While RAS-oncogene mutations increase malignancy risk, these data demonstrate a low-risk phenotype for most RAS-positive cancers. Furthermore, cytologically benign, yet RAS-positive nodules behave in an indolent fashion over years. RAS-positivity alone should therefore not dictate clinical decisions.	4
TP53 Gene Status Affects Survival in Advanced Mycosis Fungoides. ||  || TP53 is frequently mutated in different types of neoplasms including leukemia and lymphomas. Mutations ofTP53 have also been reported in mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of cutaneous lymphoma. However, little is known about the frequency, spectrum of mutations, and their prognostic significance in MF. In this study, we have optimized the protocol for Sanger sequencing ofTP53 using DNA extracted from archival paraffin-embedded biopsies. Of 19 samples from patients with stage IIB MF or higher, 31% harbored mutations inTP53. Overall survival of the patients with mutatedTP53 was significantly shorter than median survival in the age- and stage-matched patients treated in our Institution. Distribution of mutations was heterogenous inTP53 exons; however, C > T transitions were common suggesting the causal role of ultraviolet radiation. We propose thatTP53 mutation status would be useful for risk stratification of patients with advanced MF.	4
Tissue prostate-specific antigen facilitates refractory prostate tumor progression via enhancing ARA70-regulated androgen receptor transactivation. || Animals Base Sequence Cell Line, Tumor DNA Primers Disease Progression Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Mice Mice, Nude Nuclear Receptor Coactivators Oncogene Proteins Polymerase Chain Reaction Prostate-Specific Antigen Prostatic Neoplasms Receptors, Androgen Transcription Factors Transcriptional Activation || Despite being well recognized as the best biomarker for prostate cancer, pathophysiologic roles of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remain unclear. We report here that tissue PSA may be involved in the hormone-refractory prostate cancer progression. Histologic analyses show that the increased tissue PSA levels are correlated with lower cell apoptosis index and higher cell proliferation rate in hormone-refractory tumor specimens. By stably transfecting PSA cDNA into various prostate cancer cell lines, we found that PSA could promote the growth of androgen receptor (AR)-positive CWR22rv1 and high-passage LNCaP (hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells) but not that of AR-negative PC-3 and DU145 cells. Surprisingly, the protease activity of PSA is not crucial for PSA to stimulate growth and promote AR transactivation. We further showed that increased PSA could enhance ARA70-induced AR transactivation via modulating the p53 pathway that results in the decreased apoptosis and increased cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of PSA in LNCaP and CWR22rv1 cells causes cell apoptosis and cell growth arrest at the G(1) phase. In vitro colony formation assay and in vivo xenografted tumor results showed the suppression of prostate cancer growth via targeting PSA expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that, in addition to being a biomarker, PSA may also become a new potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer. PSA small interfering RNA or smaller molecules that can degrade PSA protein may be developed as alternative approaches to treat the prostate cancer.	0
Synchronous and Metastatic Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Carcinomas with Unique Molecular Signatures. || Adenocarcinoma, Follicular Carcinoma, Papillary Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Lymphatic Metastasis Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms, Multiple Primary Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Thyroid Neoplasms || Despite the relatively high prevalence of thyroid cancer, the occurrence of multiple synchronous, distinct subtypes of primary thyroid carcinoma is uncommon. The incidental finding of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in a gland with a biologically relevant follicular or medullary carcinoma is more frequent than the synchronous occurrence of multiple clinically significant carcinomas. We report a case of synchronous papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas metastatic to lymph node and bone, respectively. Next generation sequencing showed BRAF V600E mutation in the primary papillary carcinoma and NRAS Q61R mutation in the primary follicular carcinoma and bony metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of synchronous and metastatic primary papillary and follicular carcinomas, and the first report of synchronous BRAF V600E mutated papillary and NRAS mutated follicular carcinoma.	4
Hot Spot Mutation in TP53 (R248Q) Causes Oncogenic Gain-of-Function Phenotypes in a Breast Cancer Cell Line Derived from an African American patient. || Adult African Americans Aged Aged, 80 and over Cell Line, Tumor Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || African American (AA) breast cancer patients often have triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that contains mutations in the TP53 gene. The point mutations at amino acid residues R273 and R248 both result in oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) phenotypes. Expression of mutant p53 (mtp53) R273H associates with increased cell elasticity, survival under serum deprivation conditions, and increased Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) on the chromatin in the AA-derived TNBC breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. We hypothesized that GOF mtp53 R248Q expression could stimulate a similar phenotype in the AA-derived TNBC cell line HCC70. To test this hypothesis we depleted the R248Q protein in the HCC70 cell line using shRNA-mediated knockdown. Using impedance-based real-time analysis we correlated the expression of mtp53 R248Q with increased cell deformability. We also documented that depletion of mtp53 R248Q increased PARP1 in the cytoplasm and decreased PARP1 on the chromatin. We conclude that in the AA-derived TNBC HCC70 cells mtp53 R248Q expression results in a causative tumor associated phenotype. This study supports using the biological markers of high expression of mtp53 R273H or R248Q as additional diagnostics for TNBC resistant subtypes often found in the AA community. Each mtp53 protein must be considered separately and this work adds R248Q to the increasing list of p53 mutations that can be used for diagnostics and drug targeting. Here we report that when R248Q mtp53 proteins are expressed in TNBC, then targeting the gain-of-function pathways may improve treatment efficacy.	0
ERK2, but not ERK1, mediates acquired and "de novo" resistance to imatinib mesylate: implication for CML therapy. || Antineoplastic Agents Benzamides Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Enzyme Activation Genes, abl Humans Imatinib Mesylate Immunohistochemistry Immunoprecipitation Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Piperazines Point Mutation Pyrimidines Signal Transduction || Resistance to Imatinib Mesylate (IM) is a major problem in Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia management. Most of the studies about resistance have focused on point mutations on BCR/ABL. However, other types of resistance that do not imply mutations in BCR/ABL have been also described. In the present report we aim to study the role of several MAPK in IM resistance not associate to BCR/ABL mutations. Therefore we used an experimental system of resistant cell lines generated by co-culturing with IM (K562, Lama 84) as well as primary material from resistant and responder patient without BCR/ABL mutations. Here we demonstrate that Erk5 and p38MAPK signaling pathways are not implicated in the acquired resistance phenotype. However, Erk2, but not Erk1, is critical for the acquired resistance to IM. In fact, Bcr/Abl activates preferentially Erk2 in transient transfection in a dose dependent fashion through the c-Abl part of the chimeric protein. Finally, we present evidences demonstrating how constitutive activation of Erk2 is a de novo mechanism of resistance to IM. In summary our data support the use of therapeutic approaches based on Erk2 inhibition, which could be added to the therapeutic armamentarium to fight CML, especially when IM resistance develops secondary to Erk2 activation.	0
Common mutations in the low-density-lipoprotein-receptor gene causing familial hypercholesterolemia in the Japanese population. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder caused by mutations of the LDL-receptor gene. In the present study, we investigated four Japanese FH homozygotes and identified five point mutations: a splice site mutation in intron 12 (the 1845 + 2 T-->C mutation), a missense mutation in exon 7 (the C317S mutation), a nonsense mutation in exon 17 (the K790X mutation), a missense mutation in exon 14 (the P664L mutation), and a missense mutation in exon 4 (the E119K mutation). We developed simple methods for detecting these mutations. When we examined the presence of these mutations in 24 unrelated FH homozygotes, the 1845 + 2 T-->C mutation was found in 7 of them, and the other four mutations were unique for each proband. We also screened 120 unrelated FH heterozygotes for these mutations and found that the frequencies of the 1845 + 2 T-->C, C317S, K790X, P664L, and E119K mutations were 13.3% (16/120), 6.7% (8/120), 6.7% (8/120), 3.3% (4/120), and 1.7% (2/120), respectively. These mutations were found in more than 30% of unrelated Japanese FH patients. By using the detection methods developed in this study, the diagnosis of more than 30% of the genetic bases of Japanese FH heterozygotes is expected.	4
Towards standardization of next-generation sequencing of FFPE samples for clinical oncology: intrinsic obstacles and possible solutions. || Artifacts DNA DNA Copy Number Variations Exons Formaldehyde Gene Frequency High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Incidental Findings Medical Oncology Mutation Paraffin Embedding Reference Standards Tissue Fixation || Next generation sequencing has a potential to revolutionize the management of cancer patients within the framework of precision oncology. Nevertheless, lack of standardization decelerated entering of the technology into the clinical testing space. Here we dissected a number of common problems of NGS diagnostics in oncology and introduced ways they can be resolved. DNA was extracted from 26 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens and processed with the TrueSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (Illumina Inc, San Diego, California) targeting 48 cancer-related genes and sequenced in single run. Sequencing data were comparatively analyzed by several bioinformatics pipelines. Libraries yielded sufficient coverage to detect even low prevalent mutations. We found that the number of FFPE sequence artifacts significantly correlates with pre-normalization concentration of libraries (rank correlation -0.81; p < 1e-10), thus, contributing to sample-specific variant detection cut-offs. Surprisingly, extensive validation of EGFR mutation calls by a combination of aligners and variant callers resulted in identification of two false negatives and one false positive that were due to complexity of underlying genomic change, confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Additionally, the study of the non-EGFR amplicons revealed 33 confirmed unique mutations in 17 genes, with TP53 being the most frequently mutated. Clinical relevance of these finding is discussed. Reporting of entire mutational spectrum revealed by targeted sequencing is questionable, at least until the clinically-driven guidelines on reporting of somatic mutations are established. The standardization of sequencing protocols, especially their data analysis components, requires assay-, disease-, and, in many cases, even sample-specific customization that could be performed only in cooperation with clinicians.	4
The Crystal Structure of the R280K Mutant of Human p53 Explains the Loss of DNA Binding. || Arginine Crystallography, X-Ray DNA Humans Hydrogen Bonding Lysine Models, Molecular Mutation Protein Binding Protein Structure, Secondary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Water Zinc || The p53 tumor suppressor is widely found to be mutated in human cancer. This protein is regarded as a molecular hub regulating different cell responses, namely cell death. Compelling data have demonstrated that the impairment of p53 activity correlates with tumor development and maintenance. For these reasons, the reactivation of p53 function is regarded as a promising strategy to halt cancer. In the present work, the recombinant mutant p53R280K DNA binding domain (DBD) was produced for the first time, and its crystal structure was determined in the absence of DNA to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The solved structure contains four molecules in the asymmetric unit, four zinc(II) ions, and 336 water molecules. The structure was compared with the wild-type p53 DBD structure, isolated and in complex with DNA. These comparisons contributed to a deeper understanding of the mutant p53R280K structure, as well as the loss of DNA binding related to halted transcriptional activity. The structural information derived may also contribute to the rational design of mutant p53 reactivating molecules with potential application in cancer treatment.	0
[Diagnosis, treatment and long-term following up of 223 patients with hyperphenylalaninemia detected by neonatal screening programs]. || China Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Male Neonatal Screening Phenylalanine Phenylketonurias Time Factors || To investigate the incidence of hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) caused by different etiologic factors in China and the relationship between the phenylalanine and mental development of patients with HPAs who were diagnosed by neonatal screening and early treated. Two hundred and twenty-three patients with HPA detected by neonatal screening programs were refered to us at the age of (41 +/- 27) days after birth. The differential diagnosis was performed by BH(4) (20 mg/kg) loading test, urinary pterin analysis and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity determination respectively. The control of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism, growth and mental development were evaluated in all treated patients. Related gene mutation analysis was performed in some patients One hundred and twenty-nine of 223 patients (57.8%) were diagnosed as phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAHD), 64 patients (28.7%) as BH(4) responsive PAHD, 30 patients (13.5%) as 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency (PTSD). One hundred and forty-nine patients were followed at age of 4 m - 2 y in our clinic. The 136 of 149 patients were treated according to different etiology at the age of 1.6 m (0.5 - 3.5 m) after birth. Thirteen patients were followed up without the need for treatment. All patients had normal growth development. One hundred and eight (79.4%) of 136 treated patients had normal mental development. The negative correlation (r = -0.439, P < 0.01) between IQ and average Phe levels were observed in 58 patients. Twenty-eight patients were able to go to primary school or even university. Nine kinds of PTS gene mutations were found in 9 cases with PTSD, among which 286G-->A and 259C-->T were most commonly seen, accounting for 45%. Seven kinds of PAH gene mutations were found in 13 cases with BH(4) responsive PAHD with the R241C (43.8%) mutation being the most frequent one. The differential diagnosis should be quickly made in all HPA patients detected by neonatal screening. Near 80% patients early treated had normal mental development. The good control of blood Phe level is a key factor for mental development.	1 3
Compound EGFR mutation is frequently detected with co-mutations of actionable genes and associated with poor clinical outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Adult Aged Chemotherapy, Adjuvant Disease-Free Survival ErbB Receptors Female Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Survival Rate || Compound EGFR mutations, defined as double or multiple mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, are frequently detected with advances in sequencing technology but its clinical significance is unclear. This study analyzed 61 cases of EGFR mutation positive lung adenocarcinoma using next-generation sequencing (NGS) based repeated deep sequencing panel of 16 genes that contain actionable mutations and investigated clinical implication of compound EGFR mutations. Compound EGFR mutation was detected in 15 (24.6%) of 61 cases of EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. The majority (12/15) of compound mutations are combination of the atypical mutation and typical mutations such as exon19 deletion, L858R or G719X substitutions, or exon 20 insertion whereas 3 were combinations of rare atypical mutations. The patients with compound mutation showed shorter overall survival than those with simple mutations (83.7 vs. 72.8 mo; P = 0.020, Breslow test). Among the 115 missense mutations discovered in the tested genes, a few number of actionable mutations were detected irrelevant to the subtype of EGFR mutations, including ALK rearrangement, BCL2L11 intron 2 deletion, KRAS c.35G>A, PIK3CA c.1633G>A which are possible target of crizotinib, BH3 mimetics, MEK inhibitors, and PI3K-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, respectively. 31 missense mutations were detected in the cases with simple mutations whereas 84 in those with compound mutation, showing that the cases with compound missense mutation have higher burden of missense mutations (P = 0.001, independent sample t-test). Compound EGFR mutations are detected at a high frequency using NGS-based repeated deep sequencing. Because patients with compound EGFR mutations showed poor clinical outcomes, they should be closely monitored during follow-up.	4
Validation and utilisation of high-coverage next-generation sequencing to deliver the pharmacological audit trail. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Female Gene Frequency High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Prospective Studies Reproducibility of Results Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Predictive biomarker development is a key challenge for novel cancer therapeutics. We explored the feasibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to validate exploratory genomic biomarkers that impact phase I trial selection. We prospectively enrolled 158 patients with advanced solid tumours referred for phase I clinical trials at the Royal Marsden Hospital (October 2012 to March 2013). After fresh and/or archived tumour tissue were obtained, 93 patients remained candidates for phase I trials. Results from tumour sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq were cross-validated in 27 out of 93 patients on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (IT-PGM) blinded to results. MiSeq validation with Sequenom MassARRAY OncoCarta 1.0 (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was performed in a separate cohort. We found 97% concordance of mutation calls by MiSeq and IT-PGM at a variant allele frequency ⩾13% and ⩾500 × depth coverage, and 91% concordance between MiSeq and Sequenom. Common 'actionable' mutations involved deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair (51%), RAS-RAF-MEK (35%), Wnt (26%), and PI3K-AKT-mTOR (24%) signalling. Out of 53, 29 (55%) patients participating in phase I trials were recommended based on identified actionable mutations. Targeted high-coverage NGS panels are a highly feasible single-centre technology well-suited to cross-platform validation, enrichment of trials with molecularly defined populations and hypothesis testing early in drug development.	4
The myosin mesa and the basis of hypercontractility caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations. || Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Humans Models, Biological Mutation Myocardial Contraction Myosin Heavy Chains || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is primarily caused by mutations in β-cardiac myosin and myosin-binding protein-C (MyBP-C). Changes in the contractile parameters of myosin measured so far do not explain the clinical hypercontractility caused by such mutations. We propose that hypercontractility is due to an increase in the number of myosin heads (S1) that are accessible for force production. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate myosin tail (S2)-dependent functional regulation of actin-activated human β-cardiac myosin ATPase. In addition, we show that both S2 and MyBP-C bind to S1 and that phosphorylation of either S1 or MyBP-C weakens these interactions. Importantly, the S1-S2 interaction is also weakened by four myosin HCM-causing mutations but not by two other mutations. To explain these experimental results, we propose a working structural model involving multiple interactions, including those with myosin's own S2 and MyBP-C, that hold myosin in a sequestered state.	4
Mutant p53-induced up-regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 contributes to gain of function. || Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Flow Cytometry Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans MAP Kinase Kinase 3 Mutant Proteins Mutation NF-kappa B Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MAP2K3) is a member of the dual specificity kinase group. Growing evidence links MAP2K3 to invasion and tumor progression. Here, we identify MAP2K3 as a transcriptional target of endogenous gain-of-function p53 mutants R273H, R175H, and R280K. We show that MAP2K3 modulation occurred at the mRNA and protein levels and that endogenous mutant p53 proteins are capable of binding to and activate the MAP2K3 promoter. In addition, we found that the studied p53 mutants regulate MAP2K3 gene expression through the involvement of the transcriptional cofactors NF-Y and NF-kappaB. Finally, functional studies showed that endogenous MAP2K3 knockdown inhibits proliferation and survival of human tumor cells, whereas the ectopic expression of MAP2K3 can rescue the proliferative defect induced by mutant p53 knockdown. Taken together, our findings define a novel player through which mutant p53 exerts its gain-of-function activity in cancer cells.	0

CP-31398 restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro but does not affect p53 homologs p63 and p73. || Cells, Cultured DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Mutation Nuclear Proteins Phosphoproteins Pyrimidines Trans-Activators Transcription Factors Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The p53 protein plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability in mammalian cells. Mutations of p53 occur in over 50% of all cancers and are indicative of highly aggressive cancers that are hard to treat. Recently, there has been a high degree of interest in therapeutic approaches to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53. Several compounds have been reported to restore wild type function to mutant p53. One such compound, CP-31398, has been shown effective in vivo, but questions have arisen to whether it actually affects p53. Here we show that mutant p53, isolated from cells treated with CP-31398, is capable of binding to p53 response elements in vitro. We also show the compound restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in cells as determined by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain from two different hotspot mutants (R273H and R249S), we show that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. Using a quantitative DNA binding assay, we also show that CP-31398 increases significantly the amount of mutant p53 that binds to cognate DNA (B(max)) and its affinity (K(d)) for DNA. The compound, however, does not affect the affinity (K(d) value) of wild type p53 for DNA and only increases B(max) slightly. In a similar assay PRIMA1 does not have any effect on p53 core DNA-binding activity. We also show that CP-31398 had no effect on the DNA-binding activity of p53 homologs p63 and p73.	0
Translation Control by p53. ||  || The translation of mRNAs plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and therefore, in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Unrestricted initiation of translation causes malignant transformation and plays a key role in the maintenance and progression of cancers. Translation initiation is regulated by the ternary complex and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is the most well studied mammalian transcription factor that mediates a variety of anti-proliferative processes. Post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene expression in general and those of translation in particular play a major role in shaping the protein composition of the cell. Thep53 protein regulates transcription and controls eIF4F, the ternary complex and the synthesis of ribosomal components, including the down-regulation of rRNA genes. In summary, the induction ofp53 regulates protein synthesis and translational control to inhibit cell growth.	0
Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain in Fabry Disease: A Nationwide, Long-Time, Prospective Follow-Up. || Adolescent Adult Aged Brain Child Cohort Studies Denmark Fabry Disease Female Fluorodeoxyglucose F18 Follow-Up Studies Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Multimodal Imaging Positron-Emission Tomography Prospective Studies Young Adult || Fabry disease is a rare metabolic glycosphingolipid storage disease caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A--leading to cellular accumulation of globotriasylceramide in different organs, vessels, tissues, and nerves. The disease is associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease at a young age in addition to heart and kidney failure. The objective of this study was to assess brain function and structure in the Danish cohort of patients with Fabry disease in a prospective way using 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Forty patients with Fabry disease (14 males, 26 females, age at inclusion: 10-66 years, median: 39 years) underwent a brain F-18-FDG-PET-scan at inclusion, and 31 patients were followed with FDG-PET biannually for up to seven years. All patients (except one) had a brain MRI-scan at inclusion, and 34 patients were followed with MRI biannually for up to nine years. The FDG-PET-images were inspected visually and analysed using a quantitative 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projection analysis (Neurostat). MRI images were also inspected visually and severity of white matter lesions (WMLs) was graded using a visual rating scale. In 28 patients brain-FDG-PET was normal; in 23 of these 28 patients brain MRI was normal--of the remaining five patients in this group, four patients had WMLs and one patient never had an MRI-scan. In 10 patients hypometabolic areas were observed on brain-FDG-PET; all of these patients had cerebral infarcts/hemorrhages visualized on MRI corresponding to the main hypometabolic areas. In two patients brain-FDG-PET was ambiguous, while MRI was normal in one and abnormal in the other. Our data indicated that, in patients with Fabry disease, MRI is the preferable clinical modality--if applicable--when monitoring cerebral status, as no additional major brain-pathology was detected with FDG-PET.	4
Carrier frequency of GJB2 gene mutations c.35delG, c.235delC and c.167delT among the populations of Eurasia. || Asia, Central Asian Continental Ancestry Group Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Europe, Eastern European Continental Ancestry Group Gene Frequency Genetic Carrier Screening Genetics, Population Heterozygote Humans Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Russia || Hearing impairment is one of the most common disorders of sensorineural function and the incidence of profound prelingual deafness is about 1 per 1000 at birth. GJB2 gene mutations make the largest contribution to hereditary hearing impairment. The spectrum and prevalence of some GJB2 mutations are known to be dependent on the ethnic origin of the population. This study presents data on the carrier frequencies of major GJB2 mutations, c.35delG, c.167delT and c.235delC, among 2308 healthy persons from 18 various populations of Eurasia: Russians, Bashkirs, Tatars, Chuvashes, Udmurts, Komi-Permyaks and Mordvins (Volga-Ural region of Russia); Belarusians and Ukrainians (East Europe); Abkhazians, Avars, Cherkessians and Ingushes (Caucasus); Kazakhs, Uighurs and Uzbeks (Central Asia); and Yakuts and Altaians (Siberia). The data on c.35delG and c.235delC mutation prevalence in the studied ethnic groups can be used to investigate the prospective founder effect in the origin and prevalence of these mutations in Eurasia and consequently in populations around the world.	4
Simultaneous perturbation of the MAPK and the PI3K/mTOR pathways does not lead to increased radiosensitization. || Antineoplastic Agents Benzimidazoles Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Drug Synergism Enzyme Inhibitors Humans Imidazoles Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Quinolines Radiation Tolerance Radiation-Sensitizing Agents Signal Transduction TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases || The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways are intertwined on various levels and simultaneous inhibition reduces tumorsize and prolonges survival synergistically. Furthermore, inhibiting these pathways radiosensitized cancer cells in various studies. To assess, if phenotypic changes after perturbations of this signaling network depend on the genetic background, we integrated a time series of the signaling data with phenotypic data after simultaneous MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and PI3K/mTOR inhibition and ionizing radiation (IR). The MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 were tested in glioblastoma and lung carcinoma cells, which differ in their mutational status in the MAPK and the PI3K/mTOR pathways. Effects of AZD6244 and NVP-BEZ235 on the proliferation were assessed using an ATP assay. Drug treatment and IR effects on the signaling network were analyzed in a time-dependent manner along with measurements of phenotypic changes in the colony forming ability, apoptosis, autophagy or cell cycle. Both inhibitors reduced the tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with NVP-BEZ235 revealing the higher anti-proliferative potential. Our Western blot data indicated that AZD6244 and NVP-BEZ235 perturbed the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR signaling cascades, respectively. Additionally, we confirmed crosstalks and feedback loops in the pathways. As shown by colony forming assay, the AZD6244 moderately radiosensitized cancer cells, whereas NVP-BEZ235 caused a stronger radiosensitization. Combining both drugs did not enhance the NVP-BEZ235-mediated radiosensitization. Both inhibitors caused a cell cycle arrest in the G1-phase, whereas concomitant IR and treatment with the inhibitors resulted in cell line- and drug-specific cell cycle alterations. Furthermore, combining both inhibitors synergistically enhanced a G1-phase arrest in sham-irradiated glioblastoma cells and induced apoptosis and autophagy in both cell lines. Perturbations of the MEK and the PI3K pathway radiosensitized tumor cells of different origins and the combination of AZD6244 and NVP-BEZ235 yielded cytostatic effects in several tumor entities. However, this is the first study assessing, if the combination of both drugs also results in synergistic effects in terms of radiosensitivity. Our study demonstrates that simultaneous treatment with both pathway inhibitors does not lead to synergistic radiosensitization but causes cell line-specific effects.	0
Cancer-associated arginine-to-histidine mutations confer a gain in pH sensing to mutant proteins. || Arginine Breast Neoplasms Carcinogenesis Cell Proliferation ErbB Receptors Female Histidine Humans Hydrogen-Ion Concentration Mutation Protein Conformation Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The intracellular pH (pHi) of most cancers is constitutively higher than that of normal cells and enhances proliferation and cell survival. We found that increased pHi enabled the tumorigenic behaviors caused by somatic arginine-to-histidine mutations, which are frequent in cancer and confer pH sensing not seen with wild-type proteins. Experimentally raising the pHi increased the activity of R776H mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-R776H), thereby increasing proliferation and causing transformation in fibroblasts. An Arg-to-Gly mutation did not confer these effects. Molecular dynamics simulations of EGFR suggested that decreased protonation of His776 at high pH causes conformational changes in the αC helix that may stabilize the active form of the kinase. An Arg-to-His, but not Arg-to-Lys, mutation in the transcription factor p53 (p53-R273H) decreased its transcriptional activity and attenuated the DNA damage response in fibroblasts and breast cancer cells with high pHi. Lowering pHi attenuated the tumorigenic effects of both EGFR-R776H and p53-R273H. Our data suggest that some somatic mutations may confer a fitness advantage to the higher pHi of cancer cells.	0
Diurnal variation of phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in adult patients with phenylketonuria: subcutaneous microdialysis is no adequate tool for the determination of amino acid concentrations. || Administration, Oral Adult Circadian Rhythm Diet Female Humans Male Meals Microdialysis Motor Activity Phenylalanine Phenylketonurias Subcutaneous Tissue Tyrosine Young Adult || Metabolic control and dietary management of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) are based on single blood samples obtained at variable intervals. Sampling conditions are often not well-specified and intermittent variation of phenylalanine concentrations between two measurements remains unknown. We determined phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in blood over 24 hours. Additionally, the impact of food intake and physical exercise on phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations was examined. Subcutaneous microdialysis was evaluated as a tool for monitoring phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in PKU patients. Phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations of eight adult patients with PKU were determined at 60 minute intervals in serum, dried blood and subcutaneous microdialysate and additionally every 30 minutes postprandially in subcutaneous microdialysate. During the study period of 24 hours individually tailored meals with defined phenylalanine and tyrosine contents were served at fixed times and 20 min bicycle-ergometry was performed. Serum phenylalanine concentrations showed only minor variations while tyrosine concentrations varied significantly more over the 24-hour period. Food intake within the patients' individual diet had no consistent effect on the mean phenylalanine concentration but the tyrosine concentration increased up to 300% individually. Mean phenylalanine concentration remained stable after short-term bicycle-exercise whereas mean tyrosine concentration declined significantly. Phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations in dried blood were significantly lower than serum concentrations. No close correlation has been found between serum and microdialysis fluid for phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations. Slight diurnal variation of phenylalanine concentrations in serum implicates that a single blood sample does reliably reflect the metabolic control in this group of adult patients. Phenylalanine concentrations determined by subcutaneous microdialysis do not correlate with the patients' phenylalanine concentrations in serum/blood.	3
High-throughput profiling identifies clinically actionable mutations in salivary duct carcinoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Salivary Ducts Salivary Gland Neoplasms || Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a highly aggressive subtype of salivary gland cancers and there is no established standard therapy for this disease. Thus, development of molecular markers for SDC will be important to guide the diagnosis and therapy of this aggressive tumor. We performed next-generation sequencing using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq cancer panel, which explores the mutational status of hotspot regions in 50 cancer-associated genes, and we analyzed copy number variations (CNVs) of 21 genes by NanoString nCounter for 37 patients with SDC. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was also conducted to confirm ERBB2 gene amplification. Clinical records and tumor histopathology of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Genetic alterations were detected in 29 of 37 (78.3%) tumors, including mutations in PIK3CA (N = 9, 24.3%), ERBB2 (N = 4, 10.8%), and EGFR (N = 4, 10.8%). To our knowledge, this is the first time that ERBB2 mutations have been reported in this tumor type. Both PIK3CA and ERBB2 mutation status were associated with poor overall survival, but without statistical significance. ERBB2 amplification was strong and common in SDC and almost all cases also exhibited EGFR and ERBB3 amplifications. This study reports the largest and most comprehensive analysis of DNA aberrations in SDC. Our results show that PIK3CA and/or ERBB2 alterations in the development of SDC might be a useful diagnostic tool and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.	4
Mutant p53 cancers reprogram macrophages to tumor supporting macrophages via exosomal miR-1246. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Colonic Neoplasms Exosomes Humans Macrophages Mice MicroRNAs Mutant Proteins Mutation Transforming Growth Factor beta1 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53 mutants (mutp53) are involved in the pathogenesis of most human cancers. Specific mutp53 proteins gain oncogenic functions (GOFs) distinct from the tumor suppressor activity of the wild-type protein. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a hallmark of solid tumors, are typically correlated with poor prognosis. Here, we report a non-cell-autonomous mechanism, whereby human mutp53 cancer cells reprogram macrophages to a tumor supportive and anti-inflammatory state. The colon cancer cells harboring GOF mutp53 selectively shed miR-1246-enriched exosomes. Uptake of these exosomes by neighboring macrophages triggers their miR-1246-dependent reprogramming into a cancer-promoting state. Mutp53-reprogammed TAMs favor anti-inflammatory immunosuppression with increased activity of TGF-β. These findings, associated with poor survival in colon cancer patients, strongly support a microenvironmental GOF role for mutp53 in actively engaging the immune system to promote cancer progression and metastasis.	0
Prevalence of the GJB2 mutations and the del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutation in Brazilian patients with deafness. || Brazil Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Gene Deletion Gene Frequency Guanine Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Isoleucine Male Minisatellite Repeats Mutation Valine || Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of sensorineural non-syndromic deafness in different populations. One specific mutation, 35delG, has accounted for the majority of the mutations detected in the GJB2 gene in many countries. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of GJB2 mutations and the del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutation in non-syndromic deaf Brazilians. The 33 unrelated probands were examined by clinical evaluation to exclude syndromic forms of deafness. Mutation analysis in the GJB2 gene and the testing for the del(GJB6-D13S1830) were performed in both the patients and their family members. The 35delG mutation was found in nine of the probands or in 14 of the mutated alleles. The V37I mutation and the del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutation were also found in two patients, both are compound heterozygote with 35delG mutation. These findings strengthen the importance of genetic diagnosis, providing early treatment, and genetic counseling of deaf patients.	4
The Role of PALB2 in the DNA Damage Response and Cancer Predisposition. || Animals DNA Damage Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genomic Instability Humans Neoplasms Recombinational DNA Repair || The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response (DDR) is a major feature in the maintenance of genome integrity and in the suppression of tumorigenesis. PALB2 (Partner and Localizer of Breast Cancer 2 (BRCA2)) plays an important role in maintaining genome integrity through its role in the Fanconi anemia (FA) and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways. Since its identification as a BRCA2 interacting partner, PALB2 has emerged as a pivotal tumor suppressor protein associated to hereditary cancer susceptibility to breast and pancreatic cancers. In this review, we discuss how other DDR proteins (such as the kinases Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-Related (ATR), mediators BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1)/BRCA2 and effectors RAD51/DNA Polymerase η (Polη) interact with PALB2 to orchestrate DNA repair. We also examine the involvement of PALB2 mutations in the predisposition to cancer and the role of PALB2 in stimulating error-free DNA repair through the FA/HR pathway.	0
Molecular mechanisms of functional rescue mediated by P53 tumor suppressor mutations. || Amino Acid Substitution Crystallography, X-Ray Humans Models, Molecular Mutation Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Folding Protein Multimerization Protein Structure, Tertiary Static Electricity Temperature Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We have utilized both molecular dynamics simulations and solution biophysical measurements to investigate the rescue mechanism of mutation N235K, which plays a key role in the recently identified global suppressor motif of K235/Y239/R240 in the human p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD). Previous genetic analysis indicates that N235K alone rescues five out of six destabilized cancer mutants. However, the solution biophysical measurement shows that N235K generates only a slight increase to the stability of DBD, implying a rescue mechanism that is not a simple additive contribution to thermodynamic stability. Our molecular simulations show that the N235K substitution generates two non-native salt bridges with residues D186 and E198. We find that the nonnative salt bridges, D186-K235 and E198-K235, and a native salt bridge, E171-R249, are mutually exclusive, thus resulting in only a marginal increase in stability as compared to the wild type protein. When a destabilized V157F is paired with N235K, the native salt bridge E171-R249 is retained. In this context, the non-native salt bridges, D186-K235 and E198-K235, produce a net increase in stability as compared to V157F alone. A similar rescue mechanism may explain how N235K stabilize other highly unstable beta-sandwich cancer mutants.	0
ATM-dependent IGF-1 induction regulates secretory clusterin expression after DNA damage and in genetic instability. || Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins CCAAT-Binding Factor Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line Clusterin DNA Damage DNA-Binding Proteins Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genomic Instability Humans Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is a stress-induced, pro-survival glycoprotein elevated in early-stage cancers, in particular in APC/Min-defective colon cancers. sCLU is upregulated after exposure to various cytotoxic agents, including ionizing radiation (IR), leading to a survival advantage. We found that stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1R protein kinase signaling was required for sCLU induction after IR exposure. Here, we show that activation of Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) by endogenous or exogenous forms of DNA damage was required to relieve basal repression of IGF-1 transcription by the p53/NF-YA complex, leading to sCLU expression. Although p53 levels were stabilized and elevated after DNA damage, dissociation of NF-YA, and thereby p53, from the IGF-1 promoter resulted in IGF-1 induction, indicating that NF-YA was rate limiting. Cells with elevated endogenous DNA damage (deficient in H2AX, MDC1, NBS1, mTR or hMLH1) or cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents had elevated IGF-1 expression, resulting in activation of IGF-1R signaling and sCLU induction. In contrast, ATM-deficient cells were unable to induce sCLU after DNA damage. Our results integrate DNA damage resulting from genetic instability, IR, or chemotherapeutic agents, to ATM activation and abrogation of p53/NF-YA-mediated IGF-1 transcriptional repression, that induces IGF-1-sCLU expression. Elucidation of this pathway should uncover new mechanisms for cancer progression and reveal new targets for drug development to overcome resistance to therapy.	0
Overaccumulation of p53-mediated autophagy protects against betulinic acid-induced apoptotic cell death in colorectal cancer cells. || Apoptosis Autophagy Autophagy-Related Protein 5 Cell Proliferation Colorectal Neoplasms Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells HT29 Cells Humans Mutation RNA, Small Interfering Signal Transduction Triterpenes Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Betulinic acid (BA) exhibits cytotoxic activity against some cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of BA against CRC cells was little reported. Here, we proved that BA elicited CRC cells' growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BA treatment induced autophagy via inhibiting the AKT-MTOR signaling pathway. Inhibition of autophagy by either administration of autophagic inhibitor chloroquine or siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG5 could augment BA-induced apoptotic cell death as well as inhibition of cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that p53 was firstly activated by short exposure to BA and then was rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway in both wtp53 and mutp53 CRC cells. Notably, more preferential cytotoxicity of BA was obtained in mutp53 cells (IC50 values: HT29, 125 μM; SW480, 58 μM) rather than wtp53 cells (IC50 values: HCT116, 178 μM). Further experiments demonstrated that siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown attenuated BA-induced autophagy, and forced overexpression of p53 augmented BA-induced autophagy, indicating that p53-enhanced BA-induced autophagy. Moreover, BA enhanced the sensitivity of mutp53 cells to chemotherapy drugs such as 5-FU and ADR by degradation of mutp53. Overall, our study proved that BA could induce CRC cell death by inducing apoptosis and reduce the overaccumulation of BA-induced protective autophagy by degrading wtp53 and mutp53 dependent on the ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway to achieve killer effect, suggesting that BA might serve as a novel desirable drug for mutp53 cancer therapy.	0
NGS based identification of mutational hotspots for targeted therapy in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Thyroid Carcinoma, Anaplastic || Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) represents one of the most aggressive carcinomas with no consistent survival benefit when treated with conventional radiochemotherapy. Approaches targeting "oncogene addiction" of ATC are increasingly explored and first promising results have been reported in single case studies. To determine the prevalence of mutations in known thyroid oncogenes and signalling pathways amendable to targeted therapy in a large cohort of ATC. In 118 ATC (57 male/ 61 female) a total of 165 mutations were found. Genes involved in the MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathway (BRAF 11.0%, HRAS 4.2%, KRAS 7.6%, NRAS 7.6%, PI3KCA 11.8%) were altered in 33%. Targetable receptor tyrosine kinases were mutated in 11%. The most frequently altered genes were TERT in 86/118 (73%) and p53 in 65/118 (55%) cases. No mutations were found analysing ALK, KIT, MET and mTOR. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed in FFPE samples from 118 ATC using MiSeq (Illumina) and CLC Cancer Research Workbench (CLCbio; Qiagen) for mutation analysis in: ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, EGFR, ERBB2, HRAS, KIT, KRAS, MET, mTOR, NRAS, PDGFRA, PI3KCA, p53, RB1, RET and TSC2. Sanger sequencing was used to detect TERT promotor mutations. To our knowledge this is the largest study analysing mutations for targeted therapy of ATC. We found that 33% of ATC harbour mutations in pathways amendable to targeted therapy. Molecular screening in ATC is suggested for targeted therapies since current conventional treatment for ATC proved mainly futile.	4
Concordance between genomic alterations assessed by next-generation sequencing in tumor tissue or circulating cell-free DNA. || Adenocarcinoma Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein Biopsy Cell-Free Nucleic Acids Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18 ErbB Receptors Female Genome High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Mutation Pathology, Molecular Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Genomic analysis of tumor tissue is the standard technique for identifying DNA alterations in malignancies. Genomic analysis of circulating tumor cell-free DNA (cfDNA) represents a relatively non-invasive method of assessing genomic alterations using peripheral blood. We compared the concordance of genomic alterations between cfDNA and tissue biopsies in this retrospective study. Twenty-eight patients with advanced solid tumors with paired next-generation sequencing tissue and cfDNA biopsies were identified. Sixty-five genes were common to both assays. Concordance was defined as the presence or absence of the identical genomic alteration(s) in a single gene on both molecular platforms. Including all aberrations, the average number of alterations per patient for tissue and cfDNA analysis was 4.82 and 2.96, respectively. When eliminating alterations not detectable in the cfDNA assay, mean number of alterations for tissue and cfDNA was 3.21 and 2.96, respectively. Overall, concordance was 91.9-93.9%. However, the concordance rate decreased to 11.8-17.1% when considering only genes with reported genomic alterations in either assay. Over 50% of mutations detected in either technique were not detected using the other biopsy technique, indicating a potential complementary role of each assay. Across 5 genes (TP53, EGFR, KRAS, APC, CDKN2A), sensitivity and specificity were 59.1% and 94.8%, respectively. Potential explanations for the lack of concordance include differences in assay platform, spatial and temporal factors, tumor heterogeneity, interval treatment, subclones, and potential germline DNA contamination. These results highlight the importance of prospective studies to evaluate concordance of genomic findings between distinct platforms that ultimately may inform treatment decisions.	4
Association between the p.V37I variant of GJB2 and hearing loss: a pedigree and meta-analysis. || Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Connexins Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Mutation Odds Ratio Pedigree Phenotype || Pathogenic variants in the gap junction protein beta-2 (GJB2) gene are the most common cause of hearing loss. Of these, the p.V37I variant of GJB2 has a high allele frequency (up to 10%) in East Asians. Characterization of the phenotypic spectrum associated with p.V37I, as well as the role of this variant in the onset of hearing loss could have a remarkable effect on future diagnostic strategies. Here, we performed a pedigree analysis of unrelated families exhibiting various hearing phenotypes, and then conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess the association between the p.V37I and the risk of hearing loss. Pedigree analyses showed that both homozygous p.V37I variants, as well as compound heterozygous p.V37I with other GJB2 pathogenic variants, contributed to various phenotypes of hearing loss. Meanwhile, meta-analysis demonstrated that, compared with those in the wild type group, both p.V37I homozygotes and compound heterozygous p.V37I variants were at significantly higher risk of developing hearing loss (odds ratios = 7.14 and 3.63; 95% confidence intervals = 3.01-16.95 and 1.38-9.54, respectively). Conversely, heterozygous p.V37I variants alone did not increase the risk of hearing loss. Given the high allele carriage rate of p.V37I (up to 10%) within the general population, our work not only provides information that might influence future genetic screening policies, but also offers insight into clinical risk evaluation and genetic counseling regarding hearing loss.	4
The spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 alleles in Latin America and the Caribbean: a clinical perspective. || BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Caribbean Region Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genetics, Population Hispanic Americans Humans Latin America Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms United States || Hereditary cancer predisposition gene testing allows the identification of individuals at high risk of cancer that may benefit from increased surveillance, chemoprevention, and prophylactic surgery. In order to implement clinical genetic strategies adapted to each population's needs and intrinsic genetic characteristic, this review aims to present the current status of knowledge about the spectrum of BRCA pathogenic variants in Latin American populations. We have conducted a comprehensive review of 33 studies published between 1994 and 2015 reporting the prevalence and/or spectrum of BRCA1 (OMIM 113705) and BRCA2 (OMIM 600185) variants. The combined sample size for these studies consisted of 4835 individuals from 13 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as in Hispanics in the United States. A total of 167 unique pathogenic variants have been reported in the existing literature. In unselected breast cancer cases, the prevalence ranged from 1.2 to 27.1%. Some countries presented a few recurrent pathogenic variants, while others were characterized by diverse, non-recurrent variants. The proportion of BRCA pathogenic variants shared between Hispanics in the United States and Latin American populations was estimated at 10.4%. Within Latin America and the Caribbean, 8.2% of the BRCA variants reported were present in more than one country. Countries with high prevalence of BRCA pathogenic variants may benefit from more aggressive testing strategies, while testing of recurrent variant panels might present a cost-effective solution for improving genetic testing in some, but not all, countries.	4
PIK3CA mutations frequently coexist with RAS and BRAF mutations in patients with advanced cancers. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Female Genes, ras Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasms Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Polymerase Chain Reaction Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Young Adult ras Proteins || Oncogenic mutations of PIK3CA, RAS (KRAS, NRAS), and BRAF have been identified in various malignancies, and activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK pathways, respectively. Both pathways are critical drivers of tumorigenesis. Tumor tissues from 504 patients with diverse cancers referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy at MD Anderson Cancer Center starting in October 2008 were analyzed for PIK3CA, RAS (KRAS, NRAS), and BRAF mutations using polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing. PIK3CA mutations were found in 54 (11%) of 504 patients tested; KRAS in 69 (19%) of 367; NRAS in 19 (8%) of 225; and BRAF in 31 (9%) of 361 patients. PIK3CA mutations were most frequent in squamous cervical (5/14, 36%), uterine (7/28, 25%), breast (6/29, 21%), and colorectal cancers (18/105, 17%); KRAS in pancreatic (5/9, 56%), colorectal (49/97, 51%), and uterine cancers (3/20, 15%); NRAS in melanoma (12/40, 30%), and uterine cancer (2/11, 18%); BRAF in melanoma (23/52, 44%), and colorectal cancer (5/88, 6%). Regardless of histology, KRAS mutations were found in 38% of patients with PIK3CA mutations compared to 16% of patients with wild-type (wt)PIK3CA (p = 0.001). In total, RAS (KRAS, NRAS) or BRAF mutations were found in 47% of patients with PIK3CA mutations vs. 24% of patients wtPIK3CA (p = 0.001). PIK3CA mutations were found in 28% of patients with KRAS mutations compared to 10% with wtKRAS (p = 0.001) and in 20% of patients with RAS (KRAS, NRAS) or BRAF mutations compared to 8% with wtRAS (KRAS, NRAS) or wtBRAF (p = 0.001). PIK3CA, RAS (KRAS, NRAS), and BRAF mutations are frequent in diverse tumors. In a wide variety of tumors, PIK3CA mutations coexist with RAS (KRAS, NRAS) and BRAF mutations.	4
Effects of YM155 on survivin levels and viability in neuroblastoma cells with acquired drug resistance. || ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival DNA Damage Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Imidazoles Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins Kinetics Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Naphthoquinones Neuroblastoma Piperazines Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 RNA, Small Interfering Survivin Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Resistance formation after initial therapy response (acquired resistance) is common in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. YM155 is a drug candidate that was introduced as a survivin suppressant. This mechanism was later challenged, and DNA damage induction and Mcl-1 depletion were suggested instead. Here we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of YM155 in neuroblastoma cells with acquired drug resistance. The efficacy of YM155 was determined in neuroblastoma cell lines and their sublines with acquired resistance to clinically relevant drugs. Survivin levels, Mcl-1 levels, and DNA damage formation were determined in response to YM155. RNAi-mediated depletion of survivin, Mcl-1, and p53 was performed to investigate their roles during YM155 treatment. Clinical YM155 concentrations affected the viability of drug-resistant neuroblastoma cells through survivin depletion and p53 activation. MDM2 inhibitor-induced p53 activation further enhanced YM155 activity. Loss of p53 function generally affected anti-neuroblastoma approaches targeting survivin. Upregulation of ABCB1 (causes YM155 efflux) and downregulation of SLC35F2 (causes YM155 uptake) mediated YM155-specific resistance. YM155-adapted cells displayed increased ABCB1 levels, decreased SLC35F2 levels, and a p53 mutation. YM155-adapted neuroblastoma cells were also characterized by decreased sensitivity to RNAi-mediated survivin depletion, further confirming survivin as a critical YM155 target in neuroblastoma. In conclusion, YM155 targets survivin in neuroblastoma. Furthermore, survivin is a promising therapeutic target for p53 wild-type neuroblastomas after resistance acquisition (neuroblastomas are rarely p53-mutated), potentially in combination with p53 activators. In addition, we show that the adaptation of cancer cells to molecular-targeted anticancer drugs is an effective strategy to elucidate a drug's mechanism of action.	0
DNA-binding protects p53 from interactions with cofactors involved in transcription-independent functions. || Binding Sites Carrier Proteins DNA Hydrogen Bonding Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Models, Molecular Molecular Conformation Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Interaction Mapping Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Binding-induced conformational changes of a protein at regions distant from the binding site may play crucial roles in protein function and regulation. The p53 tumour suppressor is an example of such an allosterically regulated protein. Little is known, however, about how DNA binding can affect distal sites for transcription factors. Furthermore, the molecular details of how a local perturbation is transmitted through a protein structure are generally elusive and occur on timescales hard to explore by simulations. Thus, we employed state-of-the-art enhanced sampling atomistic simulations to unveil DNA-induced effects on p53 structure and dynamics that modulate the recruitment of cofactors and the impact of phosphorylation at Ser215. We show that DNA interaction promotes a conformational change in a region 3 nm away from the DNA binding site. Specifically, binding to DNA increases the population of an occluded minor state at this distal site by more than 4-fold, whereas phosphorylation traps the protein in its major state. In the minor conformation, the interface of p53 that binds biological partners related to p53 transcription-independent functions is not accessible. Significantly, our study reveals a mechanism of DNA-mediated protection of p53 from interactions with partners involved in the p53 transcription-independent signalling. This also suggests that conformational dynamics is tightly related to p53 signalling.	0
Piconewton-Scale Analysis of Ras-BRaf Signal Transduction with Single-Molecule Force Spectroscopy. || Animals Cells, Cultured Humans Mental Disorders Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutation Optical Tweezers Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Intermolecular interactions dominate the behavior of signal transduction in various physiological and pathological cell processes, yet assessing these interactions remains a challenging task. Here, this study reports a single-molecule force spectroscopic method that enables functional delineation of two interaction sites (≈35 pN and ≈90 pN) between signaling effectors Ras and BRaf in the canonical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This analysis reveals mutations on BRaf at Q257 and A246, two sites frequently linked to cardio-faciocutaneous syndrome, result in ≈10-30 pN alterations in RasBRaf intermolecular binding force. The magnitude of changes in RasBRaf binding force correlates with the size of alterations in protein affinity and in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-sensitive glutamate receptor (-R)-mediated synaptic transmission in neurons expressing replacement BRaf mutants, and predicts the extent of learning impairments in animals expressing replacement BRaf mutants. These results establish single-molecule force spectroscopy as an effective platform for evaluating the piconewton-level interaction of signaling molecules and predicting the behavior outcome of signal transduction.	0
Myosin-binding Protein C Compound Heterozygous Variant Effect on the Phenotypic Expression of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins DNA Primers Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. It is the major cause of sudden cardiac death in young high-level athletes. Studies have demonstrated a poorer prognosis when associated with specific mutations. The association between HCM genotype and phenotype has been the subject of several studies since the discovery of the genetic nature of the disease. This study shows the effect of a MYBPC3 compound variant on the phenotypic HCM expression. A family in which a young man had a clinical diagnosis of HCM underwent clinical and genetic investigations. The coding regions of the MYH7, MYBPC3 and TNNT2 genes were sequenced and analyzed. The proband present a malignant manifestation of the disease, and is the only one to express HCM in his family. The genetic analysis through direct sequencing of the three main genes related to this disease identified a compound heterozygous variant (p.E542Q and p.D610H) in MYBPC3. A family analysis indicated that the p.E542Q and p.D610H alleles have paternal and maternal origin, respectively. No family member carrier of one of the variant alleles manifested clinical signs of HCM. We suggest that the MYBPC3-biallelic heterozygous expression of p.E542Q and p.D610H may cause the severe disease phenotype seen in the proband. Resumo A cardiomiopatia hipertrófica (CMH) é uma doença autossômica dominante causada por mutações em genes que codificam as proteínas dos sarcômeros. É a principal causa de morte súbita cardíaca em atletas jovens de alto nível. Estudos têm demonstrado um pior prognóstico associado a mutações específicas. A associação entre genótipo e fenótipo em CMH tem sido objeto de diversos estudos desde a descoberta da origem genética dessa doença. Este trabalho apresenta o efeito de uma mutação composta em MYBPC3 na expressão fenotípica da CMH. Uma família na qual um jovem tem o diagnóstico clínico de CMH foi submetida à investigação clínica e genética. As regiões codificadoras dos genes MYH7, MYBPC3 e TNNT2 foram sequenciadas e analisadas. O probando apresenta uma manifestação maligna da doença e é o único em sua família a desenvolver CMH. A análise genética pelo sequenciamento direto dos três principais genes relacionados à essa doença identificou uma variante em heterozigose composta (p.E542Q e p.D610H) em MYBPC3. A análise da família mostrou que os alelos p.E542Q e p.D610H tem origem paterna e materna, respectivamente. Nenhum familiar portador de um dos alelos variantes manifestou sinais clínicos de CMH. Sugerimos que a expressão heterozigótica bialélica de p.E542Q e p.D610H pode ser responsável pelo fenótipo severo da doença encontrada no probando.	4
A comparative study of germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation screening methods in use in 20 European clinical diagnostic laboratories. || Clinical Laboratory Services Clinical Laboratory Techniques Computational Biology DNA Mutational Analysis Europe False Negative Reactions False Positive Reactions Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Testing Genotype Germ-Line Mutation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Laboratory Proficiency Testing || Thousands of clinically relevant variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been discovered and this poses a significant challenge with respect to the accurate detection, analysis turn-around time, characterisation and interpretation of these sequence variants. We evaluated the performance of different BRCA1/2 gene testing practices in routine diagnostic use in 20 European laboratories, with a focus on next-generation sequencing-based strategies as this is the technical approach implemented by or under adoption by most European clinical laboratories. Participant laboratories, selected on expertise and diagnostic service quality, tested 10 identical DNA samples containing a range of challenging pathogenic variants. A small number of errors in the detection of pathogenic and significant variants were identified (2.6% diagnostic error rate). There was a high degree of concordance (>97%) across all laboratories for all variants detected. No systematic technical flaw was identified in the strategies employed across the participating laboratories. The discrepancies identified are most likely due to human error or the way the methodology has been implemented locally, for example, next-generation sequencing bioinformatics pipelines, rather than technical limitations of the methods. The choice of BRCA1/2 testing method will therefore depend on multiple factors including required throughput and turn-around times, access to equipment, expertise and budget.	4
Genetic screening analysis of patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer from northern and northeastern Brazil. ||  || Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a hereditary autosomal inherited syndrome associated with CDH1 germline mutations. In Brazil, gastrointestinal tumors are among the most prevalent tumor types and constitute a serious public health problem, especially in the northern and northeastern regions. This study aimed to investigate germline mutations, methylation pattern and genomic rearrangements in the CDH1 gene and quantitative changes in the DNA of HDGC patients in northern and northeastern Brazil. Twenty-seven DNA samples from the members of four families affected by HDGC were analyzed using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), DNA sequencing and methylation pattern. No evidence of gain and loss events or any rearrangements were found in any of the samples tested using aCGH. No promoter region hypermethylation was observed either. Two of the four families presented different types of germline mutations. The 185G > T and 1018A > G germline mutations detected in this study have been described in Asian and European families, respectively. The ancestors of the two families carrying these mutations had originated from those continents. This is the first study to evaluate CDH1 gene germline mutations in Brazilian families with HDGC. In our study, 50% of the families showed no CDH1 gene alterations, and it is possible that in regions with a high incidence of gastric cancer, such as northern and northeastern Brazil, environmental factors might have induced the different genetic alterations analyzed in this study.	4
Molecular characterization of gallbladder cancer using somatic mutation profiling. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Female Formaldehyde Gallbladder Neoplasms Gene Expression Profiling High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Paraffin Embedding Tissue Fixation || Gallbladder cancer is relatively uncommon, with a high incidence in certain geographic locations, including Latin America, East and South Asia, and Eastern Europe. Molecular characterization of this disease has been limited, and targeted therapy options for advanced disease remain an open area of investigation. In the present study, surgical pathology obtained from resected gallbladder cancer cases (n = 72) was examined for the presence of targetable, somatic mutations. All cases were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE). Two approaches were used: (a) mass spectroscopy-based profiling for 159 point ("hot spot") mutations in 33 genes commonly involved in solid tumors and (b) next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform that examined the complete coding sequence of in 182 cancer-related genes. Fifty-seven cases were analyzed for hot spot mutations; and 15, for NGS. Fourteen hot spot mutations were identified in 9 cases. Of these, KRAS mutation was significantly associated with poor survival on multivariate analysis. Other targetable mutations included PIK3CA (n = 2) and ALK (n = 1). On NGS, 26 mutations were noted in 15 cases. TP53 and PI3 kinase pathway (STK11, RICTOR, TSC2) mutations were common. One case had FGF10 amplification, whereas another had FGF3-TACC gene fusion, not previously described in gallbladder cancer. In conclusion, somatic mutation profiling using archival FFPE samples from gallbladder cancer is feasible. NGS, in particular, may be a useful platform for identifying novel mutations for targeted therapy.	4
Piperazinyl fragment improves anticancer activity of Triapine. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Copper G1 Phase Humans Iron Piperazine Piperazines Pyridines S Phase Structure-Activity Relationship Thiosemicarbazones || A new class of TSCs containing piperazine (piperazinylogs) of Triapine, was designed to fulfill the di-substitution pattern at the TSCs N4 position, which is a crucial prerequisite for the high activity of the previously obtained TSC compounds-DpC and Dp44mT. We tested the important physicochemical characteristics of the novel compounds L1-L12. The studied ligands are neutral at physiological pH, which allows them to permeate cell membranes and bind cellular Fe pools more readily than less lipid-soluble ligands, e.g. DFO. The selectivity and anti-cancer activity of the novel TSCs were examined in a variety of cancer cell types. In general, the novel compounds demonstrated the greatest promise as anti-cancer agents with both a potent and selective anti-proliferative activity. We investigated the mechanism of action more deeply, and revealed that studied compounds inhibit the cell cycle (G1/S phase). Additionally we detected apoptosis, which is dependent on cell line's specific genetic profile. Accordingly, structure-activity relationship studies suggest that the combination of the piperazine ring with Triapine allows potent and selective anticancer chelators that warrant further in vivo examination to be identified. Significantly, this study proved the importance of the di-substitution pattern of the amine N4 function.	0
Clinical significance of BRAF non-V600E mutations on the therapeutic effects of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment in patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer: the Biomarker Research for anti-EGFR monoclonal Antibodies by Comprehensive Cancer genomics (BREAC) study. || Adult Aged Antibodies, Monoclonal Antineoplastic Agents Biomarkers, Tumor Cetuximab Cohort Studies Colorectal Neoplasms Disease-Free Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Female Genomics Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Mutation Panitumumab Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf || Patients with BRAFV600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have a poorer prognosis as well as resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies. However, it is unclear whether BRAF mutations other than BRAFV600E (BRAFnon-V600E mutations) contribute to anti-EGFR antibody resistance. This study was composed of exploratory and inference cohorts. Candidate biomarkers identified by whole exome sequencing from super-responders and nonresponders in the exploratory cohort were validated by targeted resequencing for patients who received anti-EGFR antibody in the inference cohort. In the exploratory cohort, 31 candidate biomarkers, including KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations, were identified. Targeted resequencing of 150 patients in the inference cohort revealed 40 patients with RAS (26.7%), 9 patients with BRAFV600E (6.0%), and 7 patients with BRAFnon-V600E mutations (4.7%), respectively. The response rates in RAS, BRAFV600E, and BRAFnon-V600E were lower than those in RAS/BRAF wild-type (2.5%, 0%, and 0% vs 31.9%). The median PFS in BRAFnon-V600E mutations was 2.4 months, similar to that in RAS or BRAFV600E mutations (2.1 and 1.6 months) but significantly worse than that in wild-type RAS/BRAF (5.9 months). Although BRAFnon-V600E mutations identified were a rare and unestablished molecular subtype, certain BRAFnon-V600E mutations might contribute to a lesser benefit of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment.	4
Mutation of the slow myosin heavy chain rod domain underlies hyaline body myopathy. || Amino Acid Sequence Chromosome Mapping Family Gene Expression Genotype Haplotypes Humans Inclusion Bodies Lod Score Muscle Proteins Muscle, Skeletal Mutation Mutation, Missense Myosin Heavy Chains Neuromuscular Diseases Pedigree Phenotype Polymorphism, Genetic Sarcolemma || To identify the gene and specific mutation underlying hyaline body myopathy in the family studied. A microsatellite-based whole genome scan was performed. Linkage analysis assumed autosomal dominant inheritance and equal allele frequencies. A candidate gene approach within the linked interval and direct sequencing were used for mutation detection. Initial analysis indicated a maximum lod score of 3.01 at D14S1280. High-density mapping surrounding the linked locus was performed. Multipoint analysis showed that the linked region with a maximum lod score of 3.01 extended from D14S742 to D14S608 with a peak non-parametric linkage (NPL) score of 3.75 at D14S608. The myosin heavy chain genes MYH6 and MYH7 map to the region between D14S742 and D14S1280. Sequence analysis of the coding regions of MYH7 revealed an A-->T transversion at nucleotide position 25596 (M57965) resulting in a histidine-to-leucine amino acid change at residue 1904 (H1904L). Pathogenicity of the MYH7 H1904L mutation most likely results from disruption of myosin heavy chain assembly or stability of the sarcomeric protein. The MYH7 tail domain mutation results in an inclusion body myopathy with an apparent absence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually associated with mutations of this gene.	4
Recent developments in neurofibromatoses and RASopathies: management, diagnosis and current and future therapeutic avenues. || Costello syndrome Legius syndrome Noonan syndrome RASopathy Ras MAPK capillary malformation-AV malformation syndrome cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome neurofibromatosis signal transduction pathway therapy || Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) was the first RASopathy and is now one of many RASopathies that are caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Their common underlying pathogenetic etiology causes significant overlap in phenotypic features which includes craniofacial dysmorphology, cardiac, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, GI and ocular abnormalities, and a predisposition to cancer. The proceedings from the symposium "Recent Developments in Neurofibromatoses (NF) and RASopathies: Management, Diagnosis and Current and Future Therapeutic Avenues" chronicle this timely and topical clinical translational research symposium. The overarching goal was to bring together clinicians, basic scientists, physician-scientists, advocate leaders, trainees, students and individuals with Ras pathway syndromes to discuss the most state-of-the-art basic science and clinical issues in an effort to spark collaborations directed towards the best practices and therapies for individuals with RASopathies.	4
Mutational analysis of the SLC26A4 gene in Chinese sporadic nonsyndromic hearing-impaired children. || Adolescent Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool China Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Microarray Analysis Mutation Phenotype Sulfate Transporters Vestibular Aqueduct || To investigate the mutations of SLC26A4 gene and the relevant phenotype in Chinese sporadic nonsyndromic hearing-impaired children. 195 Chinese sporadic nonsyndromic hearing-impaired children were subjected to microarray-based mutation detection for 9 hot spot mutations in four of the most common deafness-related genes (GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3, and 12s rRNA). Subsequently, twenty-one patients with one SLC26A4 mutation detected by microarray were subjected to sequencing analysis of the whole SLC26A4 coding region and the splice sites in order to identify the second mutant allele. The inner ear malformation and hearing loss level were compared among different genotypes. The incidence of genetic mutations was found to be 43.59% (85/195) in this patient group using CapitalBio Deafness Gene Mutation Detection Array Kit. A total of 34 children (17.44%) were found carrying the mutant SLC26A4 sequences. Thirteen (6.67%) children carried two mutant alleles of SLC26A4 and 21 (10.77%) children carried one mutant allele of SLC26A4. After the application of subsequent sequencing analysis, 13 mutational variants including 4 novel variants, two missense (p.D661G, p.N457D), one splice site mutation (IVS15+1G>A) and one frameshift mutation (624_632del9insACTTGGC), were identified in SLC26A4 gene in 15 of the 21 previously monoallelic patients. No second mutation was identified in the remaining 6 children. Biallelic mutations of SLC26A4 were identified in 20 of 21 children with enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Our results demonstrated that genetic factors were important causes for sporadic nonsyndromic hearing loss in Chinese pediatric cases. Mutation of SLC26A4 is one of the major genetic causes in nonsyndromic hearing loss with inner ear malformation. IVS7-2A>G, 2168A>G and 1229C>T were the most frequent mutations identified in our studies. The combination of microarray testing and sequencing analysis is a useful and high-throughput method for the diagnosis of genetic hearing loss.	1
Additional phenotypic features of Muenke syndrome in 2 Dutch families. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Arginine Craniosynostoses Female Humans Male Netherlands Pedigree Phenotype Proline Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 || In about 30% of the patients with syndromal craniosynostosis, a genetic mutation can be traced. For the purpose of adequate genetic counseling and treatment of these patients, the full spectrum of clinical findings for each specific mutation needs to be appreciated. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. A number of studies on the relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation have been published. Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features. New phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow, fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already made in a family member.	4
The absence of p53 during Human Cytomegalovirus infection leads to decreased UL53 expression, disrupting UL50 localization to the inner nuclear membrane, and thereby inhibiting capsid nuclear egress. || Capsid Proteins Cell Line Cell Nucleus Cytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus Infections Gene Expression Regulation, Viral Gene Knockout Techniques Host-Pathogen Interactions Humans Nuclear Envelope Protein Binding Protein Transport Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Viral Proteins || Our electron microscopy study (Kuan et al., 2016) found HCMV nuclear capsid egress was significantly reduced in p53 knockout cells (p53KOs), correlating with inhibited formation of infoldings of the inner nuclear membrane (IINMs). Molecular examination of these phenomena has found p53KOs expressed UL97 and phosphorylated lamins, however the lamina failed to remodel. The nuclear egress complex (NEC) protein UL50 was expressed in almost all cells. UL50 re-localized to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) in ~90% of wt cells, but only ~35% of p53KOs. UL53 expression was significantly reduced in p53KOs, and cells lacking UL50 nuclear staining, expressed no UL53. Re-introduction of p53 into p53KOs largely recovered UL53 positivity and UL50 nuclear re-localization. Nuclear rim located UL50/53 puncta, which co-localized with the major capsid protein, were largely absent in p53KOs. We believe these puncta were IINMs. In the absence of p53, UL53 expression was inhibited, disrupting formation of the NEC/IINMs, and reducing functional virion secretion.	0
Human Cytomegalovirus nuclear egress and secondary envelopment are negatively affected in the absence of cellular p53. || Capsid Cell Line Cell Nucleus Cytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus Infections Cytoplasm Gene Knockout Techniques Humans Nuclear Envelope Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Virus Assembly Virus Release Virus Replication Virus Shedding || Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is compromised in cells lacking p53, a transcription factor that mediates cellular stress responses. In this study we have investigated compromised functional virion production in cells with p53 knocked out (p53KOs). Infectious center assays found most p53KOs released functional virions. Analysis of electron micrographs revealed modestly decreased capsid production in infected p53KOs compared to wt. Substantially fewer p53KOs displayed HCMV-induced infoldings of the inner nuclear membrane (IINMs). In p53KOs, fewer capsids were found in IINMs and in the cytoplasm. The deficit in virus-induced membrane remodeling within the nucleus of p53KOs was mirrored in the cytoplasm, with a disproportionately smaller number of capsids re-enveloped. Reintroduction of p53 substantially recovered these deficits. Overall, the absence of p53 contributed to inhibition of the formation and function of IINMs and re-envelopment of the reduced number of capsids able to reach the cytoplasm.	0
N-ras mutation: an independent prognostic factor for aggressiveness of papillary thyroid carcinoma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Papillary Child Codon Female Follow-Up Studies Genes, ras Humans Male Middle Aged Point Mutation Prognosis Survival Rate Thyroid Neoplasms || The clinical importance of point mutations of ras oncogene in differentiated thyroid cancers has not been fully clarified. The purpose of this study is to determine the prognostic importance of ras mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Tumors of 91 patients with papillary carcinoma were studied; mean follow-up was 14.1 years (range, 1 to 40 years). Patients were grouped as follows: class I, intrathyroidal disease, n = 21; class II, cervical node metastases, n = 22; class III, extrathyroidal disease, n = 19; and class IV, distant metastases, n = 29. DNA was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction, oligonucleotide hybridization, and DNA sequence analysis techniques. Thirteen (14.3%) of 91 tumors showed an N-ras point mutation: 4.8% (1 of 21) patients in class I; 4.5% (1 of 22) patients in class II; 15.8% (3 of 19) patients in class III; and 27.8% (8 of 29) patients in class IV. Each mutation changed codon 61 from glutamine to arginine. Patients with distant metastases (8 of 29) had a significantly higher incidence of ras mutations than others (5 of 62, p = 0.01). Patients in classes III and IV also had a higher incidence of mutations (11 of 48) than patients in classes I and II (2 of 43, p = 0.01). The incidence of ras mutations was significantly higher in patients who died of papillary cancer (5 of 15, 33.3%) than in patients who are still alive (8 of 76, 10.5%) (p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier survival curves also showed a greater mortality from tumor (p < 0.05) and a higher recurrence rate (p < 0.01) in ras-positive tumors than in the ras-negative group. Finally, in studies by multivariate analyses, positive ras mutation and age were shown to be two independent prognostic factors for prediction of death from papillary cancer and recurrence of cancer. Mutation of N-ras gene at codon 61 is an independent prognostic factor for aggressiveness of papillary thyroid carcinomas.	4
Linkage disequilibrium between phenylketonuria and RFLP haplotype 1 at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in Portugal. || Alleles Base Sequence Female Haplotypes Humans Linkage Disequilibrium Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || RFLPs of 36 normal and 41 mutant alleles at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus were determined in 31 Portuguese kindreds. A total of 14 haplotypes including 10 normal and 7 mutant alleles were observed. Almost 75% of all mutant alleles were confined within only two haplotypes, namely haplotype 9 (17.1%) and haplotype 1 (56.1%). This frequency of mutant haplotype 1 in Portugal is, to our knowledge, the highest for this mutant haplotype in all studies reported to date. Other mutant haplotypes were either rare (haplotype 2, 9.7%) or totally absent (haplotype 3, 0%). Only 24.5% of all mutant alleles were found to consistently carry identified mutations, particularly R261Q (9.8%), R252W (3.3%), R408W (1.6%) and delta I94 (3.3%). A new mutation, L249F, located in the seventh exon of the gene, accounted for 6.5% of all mutant alleles in our series. Interestingly, this mutant genotype was consistently associated with mutant haplotype 1 (P less than 0.01), as also observed for the R261Q mutation. It appears, therefore, that mutant haplotype 1 is genotypically heterogeneous in Portugal and that more than two mutations account for its prevalence in this country.	3
Small-Molecule NSC59984 Restores p53 Pathway Signaling and Antitumor Effects against Colorectal Cancer via p73 Activation and Degradation of Mutant p53. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Camptothecin Cell Line, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms DNA-Binding Proteins Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Drug Synergism Gene Knockdown Techniques Genes, p53 Humans Irinotecan Neoplasm Proteins Nitrofurans Nuclear Proteins Piperazines Proteolysis RNA, Small Interfering Recombinant Fusion Proteins Signal Transduction Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Stem Cell Assay Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || The tumor-suppressor p53 prevents cancer development via initiating cell-cycle arrest, cell death, repair, or antiangiogenesis processes. Over 50% of human cancers harbor cancer-causing mutant p53. p53 mutations not only abrogate its tumor-suppressor function, but also endow mutant p53 with a gain of function (GOF), creating a proto-oncogene that contributes to tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and chemo- or radiotherapy resistance. Thus, targeting mutant p53 to restore a wild-type p53 signaling pathway provides an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. We demonstrate that small-molecule NSC59984 not only restores wild-type p53 signaling, but also depletes mutant p53 GOF. NSC59984 induces mutant p53 protein degradation via MDM2 and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. NSC59984 restores wild-type p53 signaling via p73 activation, specifically in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer cells. At therapeutic doses, NSC59984 induces p73-dependent cell death in cancer cells with minimal genotoxicity and without evident toxicity toward normal cells. NSC59984 synergizes with CPT11 to induce cell death in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer cells and inhibits mutant p53-associated colon tumor xenograft growth in a p73-dependent manner in vivo. We hypothesize that specific targeting of mutant p53 may be essential for anticancer strategies that involve the stimulation of p73 in order to efficiently restore tumor suppression. Taken together, our data identify NSC59984 as a promising lead compound for anticancer therapy that acts by targeting GOF-mutant p53 and stimulates p73 to restore the p53 pathway signaling.	0
Identification of three novel PKU mutations among Chinese: evidence for recombination or recurrent mutation at the PAH locus. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Codon European Continental Ancestry Group Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Recombination, Genetic || Three novel mutations have been identified in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genes of Chinese classical phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. Two of these substitutions (W326X and Y356X) result in the generation of a premature stop codon, while the third (IVS-7nt2) alters an invariant dinucleotide splicing signal. These mutations together account for about 10% of all PKU alleles in the Chinese population. The W326X mutation is associated with PAH RFLP haplotype 4, the most common haplotype in Orientals, while the IVS-7nt2 mutation occurs once on a haplotype 7 chromosome. The Y356X mutation is associated with multiple haplotypes, possibly due to crossover, gene conversion, or recurrent mutation.	1 3
Silencing the Nucleocytoplasmic O-GlcNAc Transferase Reduces Proliferation, Adhesion, and Migration of Cancer and Fetal Human Colon Cell Lines. ||  || The post-translational modification of proteins by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is regulated by a unique couple of enzymes. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) transfers the GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc, the final product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), whereas O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes it. This study and others show that OGT and O-GlcNAcylation levels are increased in cancer cell lines. In that context, we studied the effect of OGT silencing in the colon cancer cell lines HT29 and HCT116 and the primary colon cell line CCD841CoN. Herein, we report that OGT silencing diminished proliferation, in vitro cell survival and adhesion of primary and cancer cell lines. SiOGT dramatically decreased HT29 and CCD841CoN migration, CCD841CoN harboring high capabilities of migration in Boyden chamber system when compared to HT29 and HCT116. The expression levels of actin and tubulin were unaffected by OGT knockdown but siOGT seemed to disorganize microfilament, microtubule, and vinculin networks in CCD841CoN. While cancer cell lines harbor higher levels of OGT and O-GlcNAcylation to fulfill their proliferative and migratory properties, in agreement with their higher consumption of HBP main substrates glucose and glutamine, our data demonstrate that OGT expression is not only necessary for the biological properties of cancer cell lines but also for normal cells.	0
Breast and Ovarian Cancer Risk due to Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Variants in Pakistani Population: A Pakistani Database Report. ||  || Introduction. Pakistani population has a very rich anthrogeneological background with waves of migration from neighboring regions. Incidence rates of breast and ovarian cancer in Pakistan are on such a rapid rise that it is necessary to check the contributory factors, genetic and nongenetic. An insight into the prevalence data emphasizes the formulation of a BRCA1 and BRCA2 database for the Pakistani population. Method. In this study conducted by authors, data from diagnosed cases of both sporadic and inherited female breast and ovarian cancer cases was gathered after performing molecular genetic analysis by screening for alterations in the coding sequence of the BRCA gene. The region of interest was analyzed by the aid of various molecular biology tools such as automated DNA sequencer. Bioinformatics software was used to interpret the results, and database was prepared. Results. Mutational screening of the exons in all the samples of our study group did not reveal any pathogenic mutation. These results along with the results of the previous Pakistani studies for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were summed up to prepare a Pakistani database. Percentage involvement of these genes was estimated. Nine percent of these cancers show alterations in BRCA1 gene while 3 percent have shown BRCA2 variants. The remaining 88 percent of breast and ovarian cancers can be attributed to the involvement of other genes.	4
MicroRNA-661 modulates redox and metabolic homeostasis in colon cancer. || Cell Line, Tumor Colonic Neoplasms Energy Metabolism Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition HEK293 Cells Homeostasis Humans MicroRNAs Mitochondria Oxidation-Reduction Oxidative Stress Oxygen Consumption Pentose Phosphate Pathway Reactive Oxygen Species || Cancer cell survival and metastasis are dependent on metabolic reprogramming that is capable of increasing resistance to oxidative and energetic stress. Targeting these two processes can be crucial for cancer progression. Herein, we describe the role of microRNA-661 (miR661) as epigenetic regulator of colon cancer (CC) cell metabolism. MicroR661 induces a global increase in reactive oxygen species, specifically in mitochondrial superoxide anions, which appears to be mediated by decreased carbohydrate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway, and by a higher dependency on mitochondrial respiration. MicroR661 overexpression in non-metastatic human CC cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype, and a reduced tolerance to metabolic stress. This seems to be a general effect of miR661 in CC, since metastatic CC cell metabolism is also compromised upon miR661 overexpression. We propose hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase M2 as two key players related to the observed metabolic reprogramming. Finally, the clinical relevance of miR661 expression levels in stage-II and III CC patients is discussed. In conclusion, we propose miR661 as a potential modulator of redox and metabolic homeostasis in CC.	0
Intracellular clusterin inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis by suppressing p53-activating stress signals and stabilizing the cytosolic Ku70-Bax protein complex. || Antigens, Nuclear Cell Line, Tumor Clusterin Cytosol DNA-Binding Proteins Genes, p53 Humans Ku Autoantigen Mitochondria Organelles RNA, Small Interfering bcl-2-Associated X Protein || Secretory clusterin (sCLU)/apolipoprotein J is an extracellular chaperone that has been functionally implicated in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, apoptotic cell death, and tumorigenesis. It exerts a prosurvival function against most therapeutic treatments for cancer and is currently an antisense target in clinical trials for tumor therapy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its function remained largely unknown. The molecular effects of small interfering RNA-mediated sCLU depletion in nonstressed human cancer cells were examined by focusing entirely on the endogenously expressed sCLU protein molecules and combining molecular, biochemical, and microscopic approaches. We report here that sCLU depletion in nonstressed human cancer cells signals stress that induces p53-dependent growth retardation and high rates of endogenous apoptosis. We discovered that increased apoptosis in sCLU-depleted cells correlates to altered ratios of proapoptotic to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members, is amplified by p53, and is executed by mitochondrial dysfunction. sCLU depletion-related stress signals originate from several sites, because sCLU is an integral component of not only the secretory pathway but also the nucleocytosolic continuum and mitochondria. In the cytoplasm, sCLU depletion disrupts the Ku70-Bax complex and triggers Bax activation and relocation to mitochondria. We show that sCLU binds and thereby stabilizes the Ku70-Bax protein complex serving as a cytosol retention factor for Bax. We suggest that elevated sCLU levels may enhance tumorigenesis by interfering with Bax proapoptotic activities and contribute to one of the major characteristics of cancer cells, that is, resistance to apoptosis.	0
Practical Experience of the Application of a Weighted Burden Test to Whole Exome Sequence Data for Obesity and Schizophrenia. || Alleles Data Interpretation, Statistical Exome Genetic Variation Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Obesity Phenotype Schizophrenia || For biological and statistical reasons it makes sense to combine information from variants at the level of the gene. One may wish to give more weight to variants which are rare and those that are more likely to affect function. A combined weighting scheme, implemented in the SCOREASSOC program, was applied to whole exome sequence data for 1392 subjects with schizophrenia and 982 with obesity from the UK10K project. Results conformed fairly well with null hypothesis expectations and no individual gene was strongly implicated. However, a number of the higher ranked genes appear plausible candidates as being involved in one or other phenotype and may warrant further investigation. These include MC4R, NLGN2, CRP, DONSON, GTF3A, IL36B, ADCYAP1R1, ARSA, DLG1, SIK2, SLAIN1, UBE2Q2, ZNF507, CRHR1, MUSK, NSF, SNORD115, GDF3 and HIBADH. Some individual variants in these genes have different frequencies between cohorts and could be genotyped in additional subjects. For other genes, there is a general excess of variants at many different sites so attempts at replication would be more difficult. Overall, the weighted burden test provides a convenient method for using sequence data to highlight genes of interest.	4

Assessment of tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness in Turkish hyperphenylalaninemic patients. ||  || Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) therapy is the latest alternative approach in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, and is suggested for a number of hyperphenylalaninemic (HPA) patients with certain mutations. In our unit, therapeutic efficacy of BH4 was evaluated in 20 HPA patients (4 mild HPA, 9 mild phenylketonuria-PKU, 7 moderate PKU) by a single oral dose of BH4. Overall, 60% of the patients responded (45% favorably, 15% partially). All of the mild HPA patients and 55% of mild PKU patients responded to BH4 favorably and an additional 11% of mild PKU patients responded partially. Of 7 moderate PKU patients, 2 responded partially (28%). The genotypes of the patients who responded to BH4 favorably were: DelF39/-, L48S/L48S, R261Q/- (4 patients), A300S/IVS2nt5g > c, A300S/-, E390G/E390G. The genotypes of the patients who exhibited a partial response were: L48S/L48S, R261Q/ R261Q, IVS10nt546/-. We concluded that since there are too many mutations and many patients are compound heterozygote, it is difficult to predict BH4 responsiveness based solely on genotype, especially for the mutations which show inconsistent phenotypes. The best way to identify the patients who are more likely to benefit from BH4 administration is performing BH4 loading test. Long-term BH4 loading test should be performed in classical and moderate PKU patients to confirm that they are not responsive to BH4.	1 3
Small molecule restoration of wildtype structure and function of mutant p53 using a novel zinc-metallochaperone based mechanism. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay HCT116 Cells Humans MCF-7 Cells Metallochaperones Mutation Protein Binding Protein Folding Pyridines Reactive Oxygen Species Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc || NSC319726 (ZMC1) is a small molecule that reactivates mutant p53 by restoration of WT structure/function to the most common p53 missense mutant (p53-R175H). We investigated the mechanism by which ZMC1 reactivates p53-R175H and provide evidence that ZMC1: 1) restores WT structure by functioning as a zinc-metallochaperone, providing an optimal concentration of zinc to facilitate proper folding; and 2) increases cellular reactive oxygen species that transactivate the newly conformed p53-R175H (via post-translational modifications), inducing an apoptotic program. We not only demonstrate that this zinc metallochaperone function is possessed by other zinc-binding small molecules, but that it can reactivate other p53 mutants with impaired zinc binding. This represents a novel mechanism for an anti-cancer drug and a new pathway to drug mutant p53. We have elucidated a novel mechanism to restore wild-type structure/function to mutant p53 using small molecules functioning as zinc-metallochaperones. The pharmacologic delivery of a metal ion to restore proper folding of a mutant protein is unique to medicinal chemistry and represents a new pathway to drug mutant p53.	0
Toward the rational design of p53-stabilizing drugs: probing the surface of the oncogenic Y220C mutant. || 2-Propanol Antineoplastic Agents Binding Sites Crystallography, X-Ray Drug Design Humans Ligands Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Neoplasms Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Stability Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 cancer mutation Y220C induces formation of a cavity on the protein's surface that can accommodate stabilizing small molecules. We combined fragment screening and molecular dynamics to assess the druggability of p53-Y220C and map ligand interaction sites within the mutational cavity. Elucidation of the binding mode of fragment hits by crystallography yielded a clear picture of how a drug might dock in the cavity. Simulations that solvate the protein with isopropanol found additional sites that extend the druggable surface. Moreover, structural observations and simulation revealed the dynamic landscape of the cavity, which improves our understanding of the impact of the mutation on p53 stability. This underpins the importance of considering flexibility of the cavity in screening for optimized ligands. Our findings provide a blueprint for the design of effective drugs that rescue p53-Y220C.	0
AKAPs: the architectural underpinnings of local cAMP signaling. || A Kinase Anchor Proteins Animals Cyclic AMP Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases Humans Myocytes, Cardiac Protein Binding Sarcomeres Second Messenger Systems Signal Transduction || The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is targeted to specific compartments in the cardiac myocyte by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), a diverse set of scaffold proteins that have been implicated in the regulation of excitation-contraction coupling and cardiac remodeling. AKAPs bind not only PKA, but also a large variety of structural and signaling molecules. In this review, we discuss the basic concepts underlying compartmentation of cAMP and PKA signaling, as well as a few of the individual AKAPs that have been shown to be functionally relevant in the heart. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Local Signaling in Myocytes".	0
Prediction of indirect interactions in proteins. || Amino Acid Sequence Binding Sites Computer Simulation Models, Chemical Molecular Sequence Data Peptides Protein Binding Protein Interaction Mapping Receptors, Melanocortin Sequence Analysis, Protein || Both direct and indirect interactions determine molecular recognition of ligands by proteins. Indirect interactions can be defined as effects on recognition controlled from distant sites in the proteins, e.g. by changes in protein conformation and mobility, whereas direct interactions occur in close proximity of the protein's amino acids and the ligand. Molecular recognition is traditionally studied using three-dimensional methods, but with such techniques it is difficult to predict the effects caused by mutational changes of amino acids located far away from the ligand-binding site. We recently developed an approach, proteochemometrics, to the study of molecular recognition that models the chemical effects involved in the recognition of ligands by proteins using statistical sampling and mathematical modelling. A proteochemometric model was built, based on a statistically designed protein library's (melanocortin receptors') interaction with three peptides and used to predict which amino acids and sequence fragments that are involved in direct and indirect ligand interactions. The model predictions were confirmed by directed mutagenesis. The predicted presumed direct interactions were in good agreement with previous three-dimensional studies of ligand recognition. However, in addition the model could also correctly predict the location of indirect effects on ligand recognition arising from distant sites in the receptors, something that three-dimensional modelling could not afford. We demonstrate experimentally that proteochemometric modelling can be used with high accuracy to predict the site of origin of direct and indirect effects on ligand recognitions by proteins.	0
A new mutation of E-cadherin gene in familial gastric linitis plastica cancer with extra-digestive dissemination. ||  || Over a 12-month period, we diagnosed poorly differentiated infiltrative independent-cell gastric adenocarcinoma in two brothers and one sister aged 41 to 47 years. Their father had died from antral cancer at the age of 34 years. These cancers had two characteristic clinical features: rapid course and distant malignant dissemination. In all three patients, polymerase chain reaction-sequencing of the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene of white blood cells identified a heterozygous nonsense mutation of exon 3, producing a stop codon at position 95 (Q95X), resulting in a truncated protein. The alteration of this protein, which plays a crucial role in epithelial cell adhesion, probably explains the clinical expression in this type of familial diffuse gastric cancer.	4
VRK1 interacts with p53 forming a basal complex that is activated by UV-induced DNA damage. || Cell Line, Tumor DNA Damage DNA Repair HEK293 Cells Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mutation, Missense Phosphorylation Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Interaction Maps Protein Multimerization Protein Processing, Post-Translational Protein Stability Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ultraviolet Rays || DNA damage immediate cellular response requires the activation of p53 by kinases. We found that p53 forms a basal stable complex with VRK1, a Ser-Thr kinase that responds to UV-induced DNA damage by specifically phosphorylating p53. This interaction takes place through the p53 DNA binding domain, and frequent DNA-contact mutants of p53, such as R273H, R248H or R280K, do not disrupt the complex. UV-induced DNA damage activates VRK1, and is accompanied by phosphorylation of p53 at Thr-18 before it accumulates. We propose that the VRK1-p53 basal complex is an early-warning system for immediate cellular responses to DNA damage.	0
A Novel De Novo Dominant Mutation in GJB2 Gene Associated with a Sporadic Case of Nonsyndromic Sensorineural Hearing Loss. || Dominant mutation GJB2 gene Hearing loss || Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common known cause of hereditary congenital hearing loss. Rapid genomic DNA extraction (RGDE) method was used for genomic DNA extraction. After amplification of coding region of CX26 gene with specific primers, expected PCR products with 724bp length were subjected to direct sequencing in both directions. We describe here a novel heterozygous -T to -C transition at codon 202 (TGC→CGC) of the GJB2 gene in a patient, 40-year-old Iranian woman, which replaces a cysteine with an arginine residue (C202R). The dominant mutation C202R associated with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. This mutation has not previously been described in affected or control samples from other populations investigated for GJB2 mutations, indicating that it is a rare substitution. This dominant mutation was recorded in NCBI GenBank with accession number KF 638275.	4
Functional interplay between MDM2, p63/p73 and mutant p53. || Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor DNA-Binding Proteins HCT116 Cells HEK293 Cells Humans Membrane Proteins Mutation Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Many cancers express mutant p53 proteins that have lost wild-type tumor suppressor activity and, in many cases, have acquired oncogenic functions that can contribute to tumor progression. These activities of mutant p53 reflect interactions with several other proteins, including the p53 family members p63 and p73. Mutations in p53 that affect protein conformation (such as R175H) show strong binding to p63 and p73, whereas p53 mutants that only mildly affect the conformation (such as R273H) bind less well. A previously described aggregation domain of mutant p53 is not required for p63 or p73 binding; indeed, mutations within this region lead to the acquisition of a mutant p53 phenotype-including a conformational shift, p63/p73 binding and the ability to promote invasion. The activity of wild-type p53 is regulated by an interaction with MDM2 and we have investigated the potential role of MDM2 in the mutant p53/p63/p73 interactions. Both mutant p53 and p73 bind MDM2 well, whereas p63 binds much more weakly. We found that MDM2 can inhibit p63 binding to p53R175H but enhances the weaker p53R273H/p73 interaction. These effects on the interactions are reflected in an ability of MDM2 to relieve the inhibition of p63 by p53R175H, but enhance the inhibition of p73 activity by p53R175H and R273H. We propose a model in which MDM2 competes with p63 for binding to p53R175H to restore p63 activity, but forms a trimeric complex with p73 and p53R273H to more strongly inhibit p73 function.	0
Novel quinuclidinone derivatives induced apoptosis in human breast cancer via targeting p53. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Crystallography, X-Ray Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Humans MCF-7 Cells Models, Molecular Molecular Structure Quinuclidines Structure-Activity Relationship Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Small molecules that can target human cancers have been highly sought to increase the anticancer efficacy, the present work describes the design and synthesis of novel series of five quinuclidinone derivatives (2a-2e). Their anticancer activities were investigated against breast cancer cells MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells harboring mutant p53 and normal breast counterpart MCF-12a. Derivative 2e reduced proliferation of MCF-7 and MCF-12a while it has no effect on MDA-MB-231. Derivative 2e induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells which is further confirmed by TUNEL assay and it reduced the percentage of cell in G2/M phase as confirmed by increased expression of cyclin B and reduced expression of cyclin D1. Derivative 2e reduced expression levels of Mdm2, Akt and ERK1/2 by and increased expression level of p53. Moreover, the apoptosis induction by 2e was also inhibited by PFT-α as evidenced by non-significant induction of apoptosis after treatment of MCF-7 cells with both derivative 2e and PFT-α. In addition, docking study reveals that derivative 2e has a binding pattern close to the pattern observed in the structure of the lead fragment 5,6-dimethoxy-2-methylbenzothiazole bound to T-p53C-Y220C. The above findings demonstrate that derivative 2e induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via targeting p53 which merits further development.	0
Tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness: results of the BH4 loading test in 31 Spanish PKU patients and correlation with their genotype. || Adolescent Adult Biopterin Breath Tests Child Child, Preschool Female Homozygote Humans Infant Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Pilot Projects Spain || Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) responsiveness in patients with mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene is a recently recognized subtype of hyperphenylalaninemia characterized by a positive BH4 loading test. According to recent estimates, this phenotype may be quite common, suggesting that a large group of individuals may benefit from BH4 substitution, eliminating the need of life-long dietary restrictions. This underscores the importance of identifying BH4-responsive patients in each population, establishing the association with specific PAH mutations. In this work, we describe the results of a pilot study performed with 31 Spanish PAH-deficient patients subjected to a BH4 loading test. Overall, 11/31 (37%) showed a positive response with a 30% decrease in blood Phe levels 8 h after the BH4 challenge, and three additional patients, considered slow responders, showed this decrease only after 12-16 h. We report for the first time a patient homozygous for a splicing mutation with a slow response, suggesting an effect of BH4 supplementation on PAH gene expression. Most of the responsive patients belong to the mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) or mild phenylketonuria phenotypic groups. In MHP patients we report for the first time the results of parallel single Phe doses confirming the utility of these analyses for a better evaluation of the response. Genotype analysis confirms the involvement in the response of specific mutations (D415N, S87R, R176L, E390G, and A309V) present in hemizygous patients, and provide relevant information for the discussion of the potential mechanisms underlying BH4 responsiveness.	1 3
Constitutive activation of the Ras-Raf signaling pathway in metastatic melanoma is associated with poor prognosis. ||  || Genes of the Raf family encode kinases that are regulated by Ras and mediate cellular responses to growth signals. Recently, it was shown that activating mutations of BRaf are found with high frequency in human melanomas. The Ras family member most often mutated in melanoma is NRas. The constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf signaling pathway suggests an impact on the clinical course of the tumor. To address this notion, we analyzed tumor DNA from 114 primary cutaneous melanomas and of 86 metastatic lesions obtained from 174 patients for mutations in BRaf (exons 15 and 11) and NRas (exons 1 and 2) by direct sequencing of PCR products and correlated these results with the clinical course. In 57.5% of the tumors either BRaf or NRas were mutated with a higher incidence in metastatic (66.3%) than in primary lesions (50.9%). Although the majority of BRaf mutations affected codon 599, almost 15% of mutations at this position were different from the well-described exchange from valine to glutamic acid. These mutations (V599R and V599K) also displayed increased kinase and transforming activity. Surprisingly, the additional BRaf variants D593V, G465R and G465E showed a complete loss of activity in the in vitro kinase assay; however, cells overexpressing these mutants displayed increased Erk phosphorylation. The correlation of mutational status and clinical course revealed that the presence of BRaf/NRas mutations in primary tumors did not negatively impact progression free or overall survival. In contrast, however, for metastatic lesions the presence ofBRAF/NRAS mutations was associated with a significantly poorer prognosis, i.e. a shortened survival. We demonstrate a high - albeit lower than initially anticipated - frequency of activating BRaf mutations in melanoma in the largest series of directly analyzed tumors reported to date. Notably, the clinical course of patients harboring activating BRaf mutations in metastatic melanoma was significantly affected by the presence of a constitutive BRaf activation in these.	0
Assessment of clinical analytical sensitivity and specificity of next-generation sequencing for detection of simple and complex mutations. || Clinical Laboratory Techniques DNA Mutational Analysis Humans Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA || Detecting mutations in disease genes by full gene sequence analysis is common in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Sanger dideoxy terminator sequencing allows for rapid development and implementation of sequencing assays in the clinical laboratory, but it has limited throughput, and due to cost constraints, only allows analysis of one or at most a few genes in a patient. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), on the other hand, has evolved rapidly, although to date it has mainly been used for large-scale genome sequencing projects and is beginning to be used in the clinical diagnostic testing. One advantage of NGS is that many genes can be analyzed easily at the same time, allowing for mutation detection when there are many possible causative genes for a specific phenotype. In addition, regions of a gene typically not tested for mutations, like deep intronic and promoter mutations, can also be detected. Here we use 20 previously characterized Sanger-sequenced positive controls in disease-causing genes to demonstrate the utility of NGS in a clinical setting using standard PCR based amplification to assess the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the technology for detecting all previously characterized changes (mutations and benign SNPs). The positive controls chosen for validation range from simple substitution mutations to complex deletion and insertion mutations occurring in autosomal dominant and recessive disorders. The NGS data was 100% concordant with the Sanger sequencing data identifying all 119 previously identified changes in the 20 samples. We have demonstrated that NGS technology is ready to be deployed in clinical laboratories. However, NGS and associated technologies are evolving, and clinical laboratories will need to invest significantly in staff and infrastructure to build the necessary foundation for success.	4
A systematic approach to assessing the clinical significance of genetic variants. || Algorithms Base Sequence Databases, Genetic Decision Trees Female Genetic Testing Genetic Variation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Molecular Sequence Data Prognosis RNA, Messenger Risk Assessment Software || Molecular genetic testing informs diagnosis, prognosis, and risk assessment for patients and their family members. Recent advances in low-cost, high-throughput DNA sequencing and computing technologies have enabled the rapid expansion of genetic test content, resulting in dramatically increased numbers of DNA variants identified per test. To address this challenge, our laboratory has developed a systematic approach to thorough and efficient assessments of variants for pathogenicity determination. We first search for existing data in publications and databases including internal, collaborative and public resources. We then perform full evidence-based assessments through statistical analyses of observations in the general population and disease cohorts, evaluation of experimental data from in vivo or in vitro studies, and computational predictions of potential impacts of each variant. Finally, we weigh all evidence to reach an overall conclusion on the potential for each variant to be disease causing. In this report, we highlight the principles of variant assessment, address the caveats and pitfalls, and provide examples to illustrate the process. By sharing our experience and providing a framework for variant assessment, including access to a freely available customizable tool, we hope to help move towards standardized and consistent approaches to variant assessment.	4
Connexin 26 studies in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. ||  || To determine the spectrum of connexin 26 (Cx26) mutations and their phenotypes in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) or mixed hearing loss (MHL). Children with SNHL or MHL were prospectively tested for mutations in the entire coding region of the Cx26 gene. Children with SNHL or MHL with no obvious etiology for the hearing loss. Between December 1, 1998, and July 1, 2000, 107 patients with SNHL or MHL from 99 families underwent Cx26 testing. Most patients were aged 1 week to 16 years (61 boys and 46 girls). Thirty (30%) of 99 probands had Cx26 mutations: biallelic mutations were detected in 18 (9 homozygous and 9 compound heterozygous) and single mutations were detected in 12. Twelve previously reported mutations (35delG, 167delT, E47X, L90P, M34T, G12V, V37I, R143W, V84L, V153I, V27I, and 310del14) and 3 novel mutations (E129K, T8M, and N206S) were found. Hearing loss in patients with biallelic Cx26 mutations ranged from unilateral high frequency to bilateral profound. Four children, 2 with biallelic mutations, had temporal bone abnormalities. Connexin 26 mutations are common in children with SNHL, and it is likely that the homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations cause the SNHL. However, pathogenicity is less certain when only a single Cx26 mutation is present. Patients with biallelic Cx26 mutations had a slightly higher incidence of milder hearing loss than in previous studies. Children with SNHL or MHL should be tested for Cx26 mutations early in their evaluation.	4
Speech recognition scores related to age and degree of hearing impairment in DFNA2/KCNQ4 and DFNA9/COCH. ||  || To analyze the relationship between pure-tone hearing threshold and speech recognition performance in DFNA2/KCNQ4 and DFNA9/COCH, 2 types of high-frequency nonsyndromic hearing impairment. Case series with cross-sectional analysis of phoneme recognition scores related to age and hearing level. University hospital. Forty-five members of 4 separate families, all carrying 1 of 3 different mutations in the KCNQ4 gene at the DFNA2 locus (1p34); 42 members of 7 separate families, all carrying the same Pro51Ser mutation in the COCH gene at the DFNA9 locus (14q12-q13). The deterioration of speech recognition dropped to a 90% score at a higher level of hearing impairment (pure-tone-average at 1, 2, and 4 kHz) in DFNA2-affected patients (65 dB) than in DFNA9-affected patients (46 dB). At similar levels of hearing impairment, DFNA2/KCNQ4-affected patients showed better speech recognition performance than DFNA9/COCH-affected patients.	4
Detection of mutant p53 using field-effect transistor biosensor. || Biosensing Techniques DNA Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Recombinant Proteins Surface Plasmon Resonance Transistors, Electronic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We assessed the abilities of wild p53 and mutant p53 proteins to interact with the consensus DNA-binding sequence using a MOSFET biosensor. This is the first report in which mutant p53 has been detected on the basis of DNA-protein interaction using a FET-type biosensor. In an effort to evaluate the performance of this protocol, we constructed the core domain of wild p53 and mutant p53 (R248W), which is DNA-binding-defective. After the immobilization of the cognate DNA to the sensing layer, wild p53 and mutant p53 were applied to the DNA-coated gate surface, and subsequently analyzed using a semiconductor analyzer. As a consequence, a significant up-shift in drain current was noted in response to wild p53, but not mutant p53, thereby indicating that sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions could be successfully monitored using a field-effect-based biosensor. These data also corresponded to the results obtained using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. Taken together, our results show that a FET-type biosensor might be promising for the monitoring of mutant p53 on the basis of its DNA-binding activity, providing us with very valuable insights into the monitoring for diseases, particularly those associated with DNA-protein binding events.	0
Prevalence of BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutations in Slovenian patients with advanced melanoma. ||  || Background BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT mutations are characteristics of tumour tissues that influence on treatment decisions in metastatic melanoma patients. Mutation frequency and their correlation with histological characteristics in Slovenian population have not been investigated yet. Patients and methods In our retrospective analysis we analysed mutational status of BRAF, NRAS and c-KIT in 230 pathological samples of patients who were intended to be treated with systemic therapy due to metastatic disease at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana between 2013 and 2016. We collected also histological characteristics of primary tumours and clinical data of patients and correlated them with mutational status of tumour samples. Results The study population consisted of 230 patients with a mean age 59 years (range 25-85). 141 (61.3%) were males and 89 (38.7%) females. BRAF mutations were identified in 129 (56.1%), NRAS in 31 (13.5%) and c-KIT in 3 (1.3%) tissue samples. Among the 129 patients with BRAF mutations, 114 (88.4%) patients had V600E mutation and 15 (11.6%) had V600K mutation. Patients with BRAF mutations tended to be younger at diagnosis (52 vs. 59 years, p < 0.05), patients with NRAS mutations older (61 vs. 55 years, p < 0.05). Number of c-KIT mutations were too low for any statistical correlation, but there was one out of 3 melanoma located in mucus membranes. Conclusions The analysis detected high rate of BRAF mutations, low NRAS mutations and low c-KIT mutations compared to previously published studies in Europe and North America. One of the main reasons for this observation is specific characteristics of study population.	4
Genotype differences in cognitive functioning in Noonan syndrome. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Cognition Disorders Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Developmental Disabilities Educational Status Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Male Motor Skills Disorders Mutation Neuropsychological Tests Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf SOS1 Protein || Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal-dominant genetic disorder associated with highly variable features, including heart disease, short stature, minor facial anomalies and learning disabilities. Recent gene discoveries have laid the groundwork for exploring whether variability in the NS phenotype is related to differences at the genetic level. In this study, we examine the influence of both genotype and nongenotypic factors on cognitive functioning. Data are presented from 65 individuals with NS (ages 4-18) who were evaluated using standardized measures of intellectual functioning. The cohort included 33 individuals with PTPN11 mutations, 6 individuals with SOS1 mutations, 1 individual with a BRAF mutation and 25 participants with negative, incomplete or no genetic testing. Results indicate that genotype differences may account for some of the variation in cognitive ability in NS. Whereas cognitive impairments were common among individuals with PTPN11 mutations and those with unknown mutations, all of the individuals with SOS1 mutations exhibited verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills in the average range or higher. Participants with N308D and N308S mutations in PTPN11 also showed no (or mild) cognitive delays. Additional influences such as hearing loss, motor dexterity and parental education levels accounted for significant variability in cognitive outcomes. Severity of cardiac disease was not related to cognitive functioning. Our results suggest that some NS-causing mutations have a more marked impact on cognitive skills than others.	4
Splice variant IVS2-2A>G in the SLC26A5 (Prestin) gene in five Estonian families with hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Anion Transport Proteins Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexins Estonia Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Infant Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Prevalence Protein Isoforms Sulfate Transporters || The aim of our study was to identify the IVS2-2A>G sequence change in the SLC26A5 (Prestin) gene in Estonian individuals with hearing loss and in their family members. In the years 2005-2007 we have screened 194 probands with early onset hearing loss and 68 family members with an arrayed primer extension (APEX) microarray, which covers 201 mutations in six nuclear genes (GJB2, GJB6, GJB3, GJA1, SLC26A4, SLC26A5) and two mitochondrial genes encoding 12S rRNA and tRNA-Ser (UCN). In four probands with early onset hearing loss and in five unaffected family members from five families we identified the IVS2-2A>G change in one allele of the SLC26A5 gene. We did not find any homozygosity for this splice variant. IVS2-2A>G was identified in 2.1% of probands. One of these probands, however, is also homozygous for the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene and a second patient has Down syndrome, which is also associated with hearing impairment. Therefore, in those two cases the etiology of the hearing loss is probably not associated with the IVS2-2A>G sequence change in the SLC26A5 gene. Our data support the hypothesis that heterozygosity for the mutation IVS2-2A>G in SLC26A5 gene may not, by itself, be sufficient to cause hearing loss.	4
MicroRNA-34a inhibits glioblastoma growth by targeting multiple oncogenes. || 3' Untranslated Regions Brain Neoplasms Cell Cycle Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6 Down-Regulation Genetic Therapy Glioblastoma Humans MicroRNAs Oncogenes Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met Receptor, Notch1 Receptor, Notch2 Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha Transfection || MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) is a transcriptional target of p53 that is down-regulated in some cancer cell lines. We studied the expression, targets, and functional effects of miR-34a in brain tumor cells and human gliomas. Transfection of miR-34a down-regulated c-Met in human glioma and medulloblastoma cells and Notch-1, Notch-2, and CDK6 protein expressions in glioma cells. miR-34a expression inhibited c-Met reporter activities in glioma and medulloblastoma cells and Notch-1 and Notch-2 3'-untranslated region reporter activities in glioma cells and stem cells. Analysis of human specimens showed that miR-34a expression is down-regulated in glioblastoma tissues as compared with normal brain and in mutant p53 gliomas as compared with wild-type p53 gliomas. miR-34a levels in human gliomas inversely correlated to c-Met levels measured in the same tumors. Transient transfection of miR-34a into glioma and medulloblastoma cell lines strongly inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell survival, and cell invasion, but transfection of miR-34a into human astrocytes did not affect cell survival and cell cycle status. Forced expression of c-Met or Notch-1/Notch-2 transcripts lacking the 3'-untranslated region sequences partially reversed the effects of miR-34a on cell cycle arrest and cell death in glioma cells and stem cells, respectively. Also, transient expression of miR-34a in glioblastoma cells strongly inhibited in vivo glioma xenograft growth. Together, these findings represent the first comprehensive analysis of the role of miR-34a in gliomas. They show that miR-34a suppresses brain tumor growth by targeting c-Met and Notch. The results also suggest that miR-34a could serve as a potential therapeutic agent for brain tumors.	0
Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein polymorphisms are not risk factors for venous thromboembolism. || ABO Blood-Group System Adult Case-Control Studies Factor VIII Female Humans Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-1 Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Genetic Risk Factors Venous Thromboembolism von Willebrand Factor || Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein is a receptor involved in factor VIII catabolism. In spite of elevated factor VIII coagulant activity levels being a well-established independent risk factor for venous thrombosis, the origin of this abnormality is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of polymorphisms C220T (exon 22), A775P (exon 14) and D2080N (exon 39) in the gene coding for this receptor in 249 patients (100 males/149 female, mean age 36.5 SD:11 years) with venous thromboembolism and 366 controls (155 male/211 females, mean age 38 SD:11 years ) matched by age and gender. The polymorphisms C220T (CT OR: 0.9, 95%CI: 0.6-1.2; TT OR: 1.0, 95%CI: 0.6-1.5) and D2080N (OR: 0.8, 95%CI: 0.3-2.4) were not associated to thrombosis susceptibility while the polymorphism A775P was identified in neither patients or controls. D2080N polymorphism was associated with factor VIII and von Willebrand factor levels, in the control group. Heterozygous individuals (DN), compared with homozygotes individuals (DD), presented lower levels of factor VIII (mean difference: 42.3 IU/dL, 95%CI: 5.7-78.9) and von Willebrand factor (mean difference: 34.8 IU/dL, 95%CI: 4.9-64.6). In conclusion, we demonstrated an association between D2080N polymorphism with factor VIII and von Willebrand factor levels in Brazilian normal individuals. However, none of the three polymorphisms in low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein gene were related to venous thrombosis risk in these patients.	4
PIK3CA Mutations Contribute to Acquired Cetuximab Resistance in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological Cetuximab Circulating Tumor DNA Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Retrospective Studies || Purpose: Mutations inKRAS are considered to be the main drivers of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blockade in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the potential role of other genes downstream of the EGFR signaling pathway in conferring acquired resistance has not been extensively investigated.Experimental Design: Using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with mCRC and with acquired cetuximab resistance, we developed a targeted amplicon ultra-deep sequencing method to screen for low-abundance somatic mutations in a panel of genes that encode components of the EGFR signaling pathway. Mutations with significantly increased variant frequencies upon disease progression were selected by using quartile analysis. The functional consequences of the identified mutations were validated in cultured cells.Results: We analyzed 32 patients with acquired cetuximab resistance in a development cohort. Of them, seven (22%) carried five novelPIK3CA mutations, whereas eight (25%) carried previously reportedKRAS mutations. Functional studies showed that novelPIK3CA mutations (all in exon 19; p.K944N, p.F930S, p.V955G, p.V955I, and p.K966E) promote cell viability in the presence of cetuximab. Only one novelPIK3CA mutation (p.K944N) was verified in one of the 27 patients with acquired resistance in a validation cohort, simultaneousKRAS andPIK3CA hotspot mutations were detected in two patients. Among the above 59 acquired resistance patients, those withPIK3CA orRAS mutations detected in ctDNA showed a pronounced decrease in progression-free survival than patients with no mutation.Conclusions: ThePIK3CA mutations may potentially contribute to acquired cetuximab resistance in patients with mCRC.Clin Cancer Res; 23(16); 4602-16. ©2017 AACR.	4
Identification of a SNP in a regulatory region of GJB2 associated with idiopathic nonsyndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss in a multicenter study. ||  || Additional genetic changes in the regulatory region of the human GJB2 gene encoding the gap junction protein (Connexin 26) may contribute to sensorineural hearing loss. Mutations in GJB2 cause up to 50% of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI). In the present study, we screened the putative 5' GJB2 regulatory region for novel alterations. In idiopathic familial cases of NSHI lacking known pathogenic alterations in GJB2, we identified a T→C transition (refSNP: rs117685390) in a putative transcription factor binding sequence 228 bp proximal to the transcriptional start site at a homozygous frequency of 0.125 (n = 40), significantly overrepresented in comparison to the homozygous allele frequencies of 0.043 in the normal-hearing Caucasian population (n = 211; p < 0.001). In a NSHI family, inheritance of the rs117685390 C allele segregated on independent chromosomes with NSHI in conjunction with heterozygous inheritance of c.35delG, the most common Caucasian mutation in the GJB2 coding region. In a patient group (n = 32) bearing heterozygous pathogenic c.35delG mutations, - rs117685390 C allele homozygosity was also highly overrepresented (0.25; p < 0.001) and not exclusively linked to the c.35delG mutation in cis in patients homozygous for c.35delG. However, in the majority of NSHI homozygous c.35delG chromosomes examined (91/94), c.35delG homozygosity was linked to the rs117685390 C allele in cis. These results suggest that the rs117685390 C allele could represent a biomarker for the development of NSHI in Caucasian populations and may be included in risk assessment for the development of NSHI.	4
A targeted analysis identifies a high frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers in women with ovarian cancer from a founder population. || Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial Female Founder Effect Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heterozygote Humans Mutation Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial Ovarian Neoplasms Quebec || The frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in ovarian cancer patients varies depending on histological subtype and population investigated. The six most commonly recurring BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations previously identified in a founder French Canadian population were investigated in 439 histologically defined ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer cases that were ascertained at one hospital servicing French Canadians. To further assess the frequency of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations, a defined subgroup of 116 cases were investigated for all mutations previously reported in this population. A PCR-based assay was used to screen 439 ovarian, fallopian tube or extra-ovarian cancers comprised of serous, high grade endometrioid and mixed cell adenocarcinomas with serous components for specific BRCA1: C4446T and 2953delGTAinsC and BRCA2: 8765delAG, G6085T, 3398del5 and E3002K mutations. A multiplex bead-array-based Luminex assay was used to evaluate 19 specific mutations that have ever been reported in French Canadians, which included the six mutations assayed by PCR, in 116 cases representing all women ascertained within a defined 3-year window. A targeted analysis of six mutations identified 34/439 (7.7%) mutation carriers and at least two mutation carriers for each mutation screened were found. The BRCA1:C4446T mutation was the most frequently identified variant (15/34, 44.1%) among mutation-positive cases. The expanded mutation screen that also included 13 additional variants identified 19/116 (16.4%) mutation carriers, where C4446T was the most common variant (8/19, 42.1%) identified among mutation-positive carriers in this subgroup. Mutations were identified in women with serous, endometrioid, mixed cell, and undifferentiated adenocarcinomas. Within this subgroup there were 73 high-grade (G3) serous ovarian carcinomas, the most common subtype, with mutations identified in 19.2% (n = 14) serous cases. Our results reaffirm that specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations found previously to recur in French Canadian breast cancer and breast-ovarian cancer families, also recur in women with ovarian cancer not selected for family history of cancer. The high frequency of mutation carriers rationalizes genetic testing of ovarian cancer patients in this demographically defined population.	4
Screening for mutations in exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene: identification of a new deletion mutation. || Adult Aged Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence DNA Probes Exons Female Genes, Dominant Genotype Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation New Zealand Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes Receptors, LDL Sequence Deletion || DNA from 14 unrelated New Zealand familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) heterozygotes, originating from the United Kingdom, was screened for mutations in exon 4 of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. One patient was heterozygous for mutation D206E, which was initially identified in South Africa. The chromosomal background of this mutant allele was compatible with that described previously in Afrikaner and English patients, suggesting that this mutation originated in the United Kingdom. The 2 bp deletion in codon 206 and mutations D154N and D200G, previously reported in English FH patients, were not detected in this sample. In one of the patients, however, a new deletion of 7 bp was identified after nucleotide 581 (or 582) in exon 4 of the LDLR gene.	4
RFLP haplotyping and mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in Dutch phenylketonuria families. || Base Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Haplotypes Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Molecular Sequence Data Netherlands Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length || Restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotyping of mutated and normal phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) alleles in 49 Dutch phenylketonuria (PKU) families was performed. All mutant PAH chromosomes identified by haplotyping (n = 98) were screened for eight of the most predominant mutations. Compound heterozygosity was proven in 40 kindreds. Homozygosity was found for the IVS/2nt1 mutation in 5 families, and for the R158Q and IVS10nt546 mutations in one family each. All patients from these families suffer from severe PKU, providing additional proof that these mutations are deleterious for the PAH gene. Genotypical heterogeneity was evident for mutant haplotype 1 (n = 27) carrying the mutations R261Q (n = 12), E280K (n = 4, P281L (n = 1) and unknown (n = 10), and likewise for mutant haplotype 4 (n = 30) carrying the mutations R158Q (n = 13), Y414C (n = 1) and unknown (n = 16). Mutant haplotype 3 (n = 20), in tight association with mutation IVS12nt1, appeared to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (LDE) with its normal counterpart allele (n = 4). Mutant haplotype 6 (n = 4), in tight association with the IVS10nt546 mutation, showed moderate LDE with its counterpart allele (n = 1). The distribution of the mutant PAH haplotypes 1, 3 and 4 among the Dutch PKU population resembles that in other Northern and Western European countries, but it is striking that mutant haplotype 2 and its associated mutation R408W is nearly absent in The Netherlands, in strong contrast to its neighbouring countries.	3
Various p53 mutant proteins differently regulate the Ras circuit to induce a cancer-related gene signature. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Chemokine CXCL1 Enzyme Activation Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, ras Humans Immediate-Early Proteins Mutation NF-kappa B Protein Interaction Mapping Transcription, Genetic Transcriptome Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins Zinc || Concomitant expression of mutant p53 and oncogenic Ras, leading to cellular transformation, is well documented. However, the mechanisms by which the various mutant p53 categories cooperate with Ras remain largely obscure. From this study we suggest that different mutant p53 categories cooperate with H-Ras in different ways to induce a unique expression pattern of a cancer-related gene signature (CGS). The DNA-contact p53 mutants (p53(R248Q) and p53(R273H)) exhibited the highest level of CGS expression by cooperating with NFκB. Furthermore, the Zn(+2) region conformational p53 mutants (p53(R175H) and p53(H179R)) induced the CGS by elevating H-Ras activity. This elevation in H-Ras activity stemmed from a perturbed function of the p53 transcription target gene, BTG2. By contrast, the L3 loop region conformational mutant (p53(G245S)) did not affect CGS expression. Our findings were further corroborated in human tumor-derived cell lines expressing Ras and the aforementioned mutated p53 proteins. These data might assist in future tailor-made therapy targeting the mutant p53-Ras axis in cancer.	0
Targeting wild-type and mutant p53 with small molecule CP-31398 blocks the growth of rhabdomyosarcoma by inducing reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Growth Processes Cell Line, Tumor Cyclosporine Cytochromes c Drug Interactions Female G1 Phase Humans Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial Mice Mitochondria Mutation Pyrimidines Reactive Oxygen Species Rhabdomyosarcoma SOX9 Transcription Factor Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood in need of more effective therapeutic options. The expression of p53 in RMS is heterogeneous such that some tumors are wild-type whereas others are p53 mutant. The small molecule CP-31398 modulates both the wild-type and the mutant p53 proteins. Here, we show that CP-31398 blocks the growth of RMS cells that have either wild-type or mutant p53 status. In wild-type A204 cells, CP-31398 increased the expression of p53 and its downstream transcriptional targets, p21 and mdm2; enhanced the expression of apoptosis-related proteins; and reduced proliferation biomarkers. Flow profiling of CP-31398-treated cells indicated an enhancement in sub-G(0) and G(1) populations. CP-31398 inhibited proliferation in a manner associated with co-induction of SOX9 and p21. Apoptosis induced by CP-31398 occurred with translocation of p53 to mitochondria, leading to altered mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and reactive oxygen species release. In vivo, CP-31398 decreased the growth of tumor xenografts composed of wild-type or mutant p53 tumor cells, increasing tumor-free host survival. Our findings indicate that the ability of CP-31398 to modulate wild-type and mutant p53 results in the inhibition of RMS growth and invasiveness.	0
Analysis of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutational profile by combination of in-tube hybridization and universal tag-microarray in tumor tissue and plasma of colorectal cancer patients. ||  || Microarray technology fails in detecting point mutations present in a small fraction of cells from heterogeneous tissue samples or in plasma in a background of wild-type cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The aim of this study is to overcome the lack of sensitivity and specificity of current microarray approaches introducing a rapid and sensitive microarray-based assay for the multiplex detection of minority mutations of oncogenes (KRAS, NRAS and BRAF) with relevant diagnostics implications in tissue biopsies and plasma samples in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. In our approach, either wild-type or mutated PCR fragments are hybridized in solution, in a temperature gradient, with a set of reporters with a 5' domain, complementary to the target sequences and a 3' domain complementary to a surface immobilized probe. Upon specific hybridization in solution, which occurs specifically thanks to the temperature gradients, wild-type and mutated samples are captured at specific location on the surface by hybridization of the 3' reporter domain with its complementary immobilized probe sequence. The most common mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes were detected in less than 90 minutes in tissue biopsies and plasma samples of metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Moreover, the method was able to reveal mutant alleles representing less than 0,3% of total DNA. We demonstrated detection limits superior to those provided by many current technologies in the detection of RAS and BRAF gene superfamily mutations, a level of sensitivity compatible with the analysis of cell free circulating tumor DNA in liquid biopsy.	0
Co-existence of phenylketonuria and Fabry disease on a 3 year-old boy: case report. || Abdominal Pain Child, Preschool Diagnosis, Differential Fabry Disease Gastrointestinal Diseases Humans Male Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias alpha-Galactosidase || The co-existence of two genetically distinct metabolic disorders in the same patient has rarely been reported. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of the metabolism resulting from a phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. We report a case of a 3 year- old boy affected by classic PKU and FD, both confirmed by molecular data. The FD was suspected at the age of 21 months on the presence of non-specific GI symptoms (severe abdominal pain and periodically appearance of not specific episodes of gastroenteritis) apparently non related to PKU. This is the first report of co-existence of FD and PKU, two different congenital inborn of metabolism and in consideration of the prevalence of each disease this chance association is a very unusual event. The co-existence of this diseases made very difficult the correct interpretation of clinical symptoms as lack of appetite, severe abdominal pain and non-specific gastroenteritis episodes. Furthermore, this case report helps to define the early clinical phenotype of FD.	3
Withania somnifera Root Extract Enhances Chemotherapy through 'Priming'. || Cisplatin Colorectal Neoplasms HT29 Cells Humans Medicine, Ayurvedic Mitochondria Oxidative Stress Plant Extracts Plant Roots Withania || Withania somnifera extracts are known for their anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. One of their mechanisms of actions is to modulate mitochondrial function through increasing oxidative stress. Recently 'priming' has been suggested as a potential mechanism for enhancing cancer cell death. In this study we demonstrate that 'priming', in HT-29 colon cells, with W. somnifera root extract increased the potency of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. We have also showed the W. somnifera root extract enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction and that the underlying mechanism of 'priming' was selectively through increased ROS. Moreover, we showed that this effect was not seen in non-cancerous cells.	0
BRAF and RAS Mutations in Sporadic and Secondary Pyogenic Granuloma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Biopsy, Needle Child Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genes, ras Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Granuloma, Pyogenic Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Retrospective Studies Skin Diseases || Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a common benign vascular skin lesion presenting as a rapidly growing angiomatous papule. The pathogenesis of most sporadic PGs and PGs associated with port wine stains (PWSs) remains elusive. We report that of 10 PGs secondarily arisen on a PWS, 8 showed a BRAF c.1799T>A (p.(Val600Glu)) and 1 a NRAS c.182A>G (p.(Gln61Arg)) mutation. The GNAQ c.548G>A mutation was identified in the PG and in the respective underlying PWS, indicating that PGs originate from cells of the PWS. In contrast to PG, 12 papulonodular lesions, which had developed in the PWSs of seven patients, showed a RAS and BRAF wild-type status. In sporadic PG we identified the BRAF c.1799T>A mutation in 3 of 25, a BRAF c.1391G>A mutation in 1 of 25, and a KRAS c.37G>C mutation in 1 of 25. Mutation-specific immunohistochemical detection of BRAF p.(Val600Glu) confirmed endothelial cells as carriers of the mutation in secondary and sporadic PG. Our study identifies the BRAF c.1799T>A mutation as a major driver mutation in the pathogenesis of, particularly, secondary PG. These data shed light on the hitherto undetermined genetic basis of PG and classify PG as a benign neoplasm.	4
Constant rate of p53 tetramerization in response to DNA damage controls the p53 response. || Cytoskeletal Proteins DNA Damage Gene Expression Regulation Humans MCF-7 Cells Nerve Tissue Proteins Protein Multimerization Spectrometry, Fluorescence Time-Lapse Imaging Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53 have been previously investigated in single cells using fluorescently tagged p53. Such approach reports on the total abundance of p53 but does not provide a measure for functional p53. We used fluorescent protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) to quantify in single cells the dynamics of p53 tetramers, the functional units of p53. We found that while total p53 increases proportionally to the input strength, p53 tetramers are formed in cells at a constant rate. This breaks the linear input-output relation and dampens the p53 response. Disruption of the p53-binding protein ARC led to a dose-dependent rate of tetramers formation, resulting in enhanced tetramerization and induction of p53 target genes. Our work suggests that constraining the p53 response in face of variable inputs may protect cells from committing to terminal outcomes and highlights the importance of quantifying the active form of signaling molecules in single cells.	0
An N6-methyladenosine at the transited codon 273 of p53 pre-mRNA promotes the expression of R273H mutant protein and drug resistance of cancer cells. ||  || Mutant p53 proteins that promote cancer cell invasive growth, metastasis and drug resistance emerge as therapeutic targets. Previously, we reported that suppression of ceramide glycosylation restored wild-type p53 protein and tumor suppressing function in cancer cells heterozygously carrying p53 R273H, a hot-spot missense mutation; however, the mechanisms underlying the control of mutant protein expression remain elusive. Herein, we report that an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) at the point-mutated codon 273 (G > A) of p53 pre-mRNA determines the mutant protein expression. Methylation of the transited adenosine was catalyzed by methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), and this m6A-RNA promoted a preferential pre-mRNA splicing; consequently, the produced p53 R273H mutant protein resulted in acquired multidrug resistance in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, glycosphingolipids (particularly globotriaosylceramide) generated from serial ceramide glycosylation were seen to activate cSrc and β-catenin signaling so as to upregulate METTL3 expression, in turn promoting expression of p53 R273H mutant protein, with consequent drug resistance. Conversely, either silencing METTL3 expression by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibiting RNA methylation with neplanocin A suppressed m6A formation in p53 pre-mRNA, and substantially increased the level of phosphorylated p53 protein (Ser15) and its function in cells heterozygously carrying the R273H mutation, thereby re-sensitizing these cells to anticancer drugs. Concordantly, suppression of ceramide glycosylation repressed METTL3 expression and m6A formation in p53 pre-mRNA, thus sensitizing cells carrying R273H to anticancer drugs. This study uncovers a novel function of pre-mRNA m6A as a determinant of mutant protein expression in cancer cells heterozygously carrying the TP53 R273H mutation. Suppressing both RNA methylation and ceramide glycosylation might constitute an efficacious and specific approach for targeting TP53 missense mutations coding for a G > A transition, thereby improving cancer treatments.	0
[Genetic study of hearing loss in families from Argentina]. ||  || Recent advances in molecular genetics as well as improved strategies for the prevention and control of non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) have contributed to the rising importance of their inherited causes. In this study we report 32 families from Argentine with one (sporadic) or more (familial) individuals affected. All the families were initially screened for mutations in three autosomal nuclear genes and one mutation in mitochondrial DNA. These genes have been found in a great number of familial or sporadic cases of congenital deafness in Caucasians. The mutant allele 35 del G of connexin 26 (GJB2, locus DFNB1 on 13q12) was present in three families. We have investigated the gene encoding otoferlin (OTOF, locus DFNB9 on 2p22-p23) and we found the Q829X mutation in heterocigosity in two families. We have also identified in heterocigosity the 342-kb deletion of connexin 30 (GJB6, locus DFNB1 on 13q12) in one family. On the other hand, we have not found any patient with mitochondrial mutation. Since the screening for other mutations is very expensive, our main goal is to investigate the most frequent mutations in each separate gene in the argentine population and to develop simple and specific tests for each frequent mutations.	4
FGFR3 P250R mutation increases the risk of reoperation in apparent 'nonsyndromic' coronal craniosynostosis. ||  || Many patients with a clinical diagnosis of "nonsyndromic" coronal craniosynostosis have been found to be heterozygous for the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) mutation Pro250Arg. The phenotype associated with this mutation is variable and lacks highly distinctive features, so it is difficult to diagnose on clinical examination alone. The authors present a retrospective study of 76 patients with isolated coronal synostosis who were operated on in a single dedicated craniofacial unit over 25 years. The authors investigated whether any single factor, including the presence of a FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation, predisposed to an increased transcranial reoperation rate. Eight patients had repeat transcranial surgery for a functional indication. Heterozygosity for the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation, present in 29 patients in the cohort, was the only factor found to have a significant association (P=0.048) with the transcranial reoperation rate. Six patients (20.7%) with the mutation underwent reoperation on the basis of raised intracranial pressure, as compared with two patients (4.3%) without the mutation. This highlights the need for genetic analysis and long-term clinical follow-up in apparently "isolated" coronal synostosis.	4
Different Phenotypes of the Two Chinese Probands with the Same c.889G>A (p.C162Y) Mutation in COCH Gene Verify Different Mechanisms Underlying Autosomal Dominant Nonsyndromic Deafness 9. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Deafness Electronystagmography Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree Phenotype || By analyzing the different phenotypes of two Chinese DFNA9 families with the same mutation located in the intervening region between the LCCL and vWFA domains of cochlin and testing the functional changes in the mutant cochlin, we investigated the different pathogeneses for mutations in LCCL and vWFA domains. Targeted next-generation sequencing for deafness-related genes was used to identify the mutation in the proband in family #208. The probands of family #208 and family #32 with the same p.C162Y mutation were followed for more than 3 years to evaluate the progression of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction using pure-tone audiometry, caloric testing, electrocochleogram, vestibular-evoked myogenic potential, and video head-impulse test. The disruption of normal cleavage to produce secreted LCCL domain fragments and the tendency to form aggregations of mutant cochlins were tested by in vitro cell experiments. The two families showed different clinical symptoms. Family #32 was identified as having early-onset, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, similar to the symptoms in DFNA9 patients with cochlin mutations in the vWFA domain. The proband of family #208 endured late-onset recurrent paroxysmal vertigo attacks and progressively deteriorating hearing, similar to symptoms in those with cochlin mutations in the LCCL domain. We therefore suggest that the disrupted cleavage of the LCCL domain fragment is likely to cause vestibular dysfunction, and aggregation of mutant cochlin caused by mutations in the vWFA domain is responsible for early-onset hearing loss. The p.C162Y mutation causes either disruption of LCCL domain fragment cleavage or aggregation of mutant cochlin, resulting in the different phenotypes in the two families. This study demonstrates that DFNA9 families with the same genotype may have significantly different phenotypes. The mutation site in cochlin is related to the pathological mechanism underlying the different phenotypes.	4
The genetics of Alzheimer's disease. || Age Factors Aged Alzheimer Disease Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Humans Middle Aged Polymorphism, Genetic Presenilin-1 Presenilin-2 || Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder, classified as either early onset (under 65 years of age), or late onset (over 65 years of age). Three main genes are involved in early onset AD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele has been found to be a main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several genes that might be potential risk factors for AD, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Recent studies have discovered additional novel genes that might be involved in late-onset AD, such as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). Identification of new AD-related genes is important for better understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Since the differential diagnoses of neurodegenerative disorders are difficult, especially in the early stages, genetic testing is essential for diagnostic processes. Next-generation sequencing studies have been successfully used for detecting mutations, monitoring the epigenetic changes, and analyzing transcriptomes. These studies may be a promising approach toward understanding the complete genetic mechanisms of diverse genetic disorders such as AD.	4
CTLA4 as Immunological Checkpoint in the Development of Multiple Sclerosis. || Adult Antibodies, Monoclonal CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes CTLA-4 Antigen Cerebrospinal Fluid Humans Ipilimumab Male Melanoma Multiple Sclerosis || We investigated a patient who developed multiple sclerosis (MS) during treatment with the CTLA4-blocking antibody ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma. Initially he showed subclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes (radiologically isolated syndrome). Two courses of ipilimumab were each followed by a clinical episode of MS, 1 of which was accompanied by a massive increase of MRI activity. Brain biopsy confirmed active, T-cell type MS. Quantitative next generation sequencing of T-cell receptor genes revealed distinct oligoclonal CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell repertoires in the primary melanoma and cerebrospinal fluid. Our results pinpoint the coinhibitory molecule CTLA4 as an immunological checkpoint and therapeutic target in MS. Ann Neurol 2016;80:294-300.	4
Molecular heterogeneity at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in the population of the south-west of England. || Alleles DNA Exons Genetic Linkage Haplotypes Humans Mutation Oligonucleotide Probes Pedigree Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length United Kingdom || The phenylalanine hydroxylase gene locus has been studied in 35 independent phenylketonuric families in the south-west of England using RFLP haplotype patterns and allele specific oligonucleotide probes. Haplotype 3 was the most common pattern on mutant chromosomes and there was strict linkage disequilibrium between this haplotype and the splice mutation in exon 12. The R408W mutation in exon 12 occurred on both haplotypes 1 and 2. The R126Q mutation in exon 7 was found only on a rare haplotype 28 pattern. No gene carried the R158Q mutation. More than 60% of mutant genes did not carry these four mutations which were originally described in other European populations. We suggest that the splice mutation arose as a single event and spread throughout northern Europe by population migration and admixture. In addition, we believe the haplotype/mutation associations seen in our population are a reflection of the mixed ancestry of the inhabitants of the British Isles.	3
Colorectal cancers from distinct ancestral populations show variations in BRAF mutation frequency. || Adult African Continental Ancestry Group Aged Aged, 80 and over Asian Continental Ancestry Group Colorectal Neoplasms European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Rate Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Young Adult || It has been demonstrated for some cancers that the frequency of somatic oncogenic mutations may vary in ancestral populations. To determine whether key driver alterations might occur at different frequencies in colorectal cancer, we applied a high-throughput genotyping platform (OncoMap) to query 385 mutations across 33 known cancer genes in colorectal cancer DNA from 83 Asian, 149 Black and 195 White patients. We found that Asian patients had fewer canonical oncogenic mutations in the genes tested (60% vs Black 79% (P = 0.011) and White 77% (P = 0.015)), and that BRAF mutations occurred at a higher frequency in White patients (17% vs Asian 4% (P = 0.004) and Black 7% (P = 0.014)). These results suggest that the use of genomic approaches to elucidate the different ancestral determinants harbored by patient populations may help to more precisely and effectively treat colorectal cancer.	4
Talocalcaneal coalition in Muenke syndrome: report of a patient, review of the literature in FGFR-related craniosynostoses, and consideration of mechanism. || Abnormalities, Multiple Child Craniosynostoses Female Foot Deformities, Congenital Humans Radiography Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Tarsal Bones || Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene. Muenke syndrome is characterized by coronal craniosynostosis (bilateral more often than unilateral), hearing loss, developmental delay, and carpal and/or tarsal bone coalition. Tarsal coalition is a distinct feature of Muenke syndrome and has been reported since the initial description of the disorder in the 1990s. Although talocalcaneal coalition is the most common tarsal coalition in the general population, it has never previously been reported in a patient with Muenke syndrome. We present a 7-year-old female patient with Muenke syndrome and symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition. She presented at the age of 7 with limping, tenderness and pain in her right foot following a fall and strain of her right foot. She was treated with ibuprofen, shoe inserts, a CAM walker boot, and stretching exercises without much improvement in symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral talocalcaneal coalitions involving the middle facet. She underwent resection of the talocalcaneal coalitions, remaining pain-free post-operatively with an improvement in her range of motion, gait, and mobility. This report expands the phenotype of tarsal coalition in Muenke syndrome to include talocalcaneal coalition. A literature review revealed a high incidence of tarsal coalition in all FGFR related craniosynostosis syndromes when compared to the general population, a difference that is statistically significant. The most common articulation involved in all syndromic craniosynostoses associated with FGFR mutations is the calcaneocuboid articulation.	4
ΔNp63α regulates Erk signaling via MKP3 to inhibit cancer metastasis. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6 Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Mice Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Reduced expression of the p53 family member p63 has been suggested to play a causative role in cancer metastasis. Here, we show that ΔNp63α, the predominant p63 isoform, plays a major role in regulation of cell migration, invasion and cancer metastasis. We identified mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3) as a downstream target of ΔNp63α that is required for mediating these effects. We show that ΔNp63α regulates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) activity via MKP3 in both cancer and non-transformed cells. We further show that exogenous ΔNp63α inhibits cell invasion and is dependent on MKP3 upregulation for repression. Conversely, endogenous pan-p63 ablation results in increased cell migration and invasion, which can be reverted by reintroducing the ΔNp63α isoform alone, but not by other isoforms. Interestingly, these effects require Erk2, but not Erk1 expression, and can be rescued by enforced MKP3 expression. Moreover, MKP3 expression is reduced in invasive cancers, and reduced p63 expression increases metastatic frequency in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for ΔNp63α in preventing cancer metastasis by inhibition of Erk2 signaling via MKP3.	0
NFBD1/MDC1 regulates Cav1 and Cav2 independently of DNA damage and p53. || Animals Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins Caveolin 1 Caveolin 2 Cell Adhesion Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cells, Cultured Chromatin DNA Damage DNA Repair DNA-Binding Proteins Fibroblasts Gene Knockdown Techniques Histones Humans Mice Nuclear Proteins Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases RNA, Messenger Signal Transduction Trans-Activators Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || NFBD1/MDC1 is involved in DNA damage checkpoint signaling and DNA repair. NFBD1 binds to the chromatin component γH2AX at sites of DNA damage, causing amplification of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) pathway signaling and recruitment of DNA repair factors. Residues 508-995 of NFBD1 possess transactivation activity, suggesting a possible role of NFBD1 in transcription. Furthermore, NFBD1 influences p53-mediated transcription in response to adriamycin. We sought to determine the role of NFBD1 in ionizing radiation (IR)-responsive transcription and if NFBD1 influences transcription independently of p53. Using microarray analysis, we identified genes altered upon NFBD1 knockdown. Surprisingly, most NFBD1 regulated genes are regulated in both the absence and presence of IR, thus pointing toward a novel function for NFBD1 outside of the DNA damage response. Furthermore, NFBD1 knockdown regulated genes mostly independent of p53 knockdown. These genes are involved in pathways including focal adhesion signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, and insulin signaling. We found that CAV1 and CAV2 mRNA and protein levels are reduced by both NFBD1 knockdown and knockout independently of IR and p53. NFBD1-depleted cells exhibit some similar phenotypes to Cav1-depleted cells. Furthermore, like Cav1-depletion, NFBD1 shRNA increases Erk phosphorylation. Thus, Cav1 could act as a mediator of the DNA-damage independent effects of NFBD1 in mitogenic signaling.	0
Systematic analyses of the cytotoxic effects of compound 11a, a putative synthetic agonist of photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (PNR), in cancer cell lines. || Antineoplastic Agents Cell Cycle HeLa Cells Humans Orphan Nuclear Receptors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Photoreceptor cell-specific receptor (PNR/NR2E3) is an orphan nuclear receptor that plays a critical role in retinal development and photoreceptor maintenance. The disease-causing mutations in PNR have a pleiotropic effect resulting in varying retinal diseases. Recently, PNR has been implicated in control of cellular functions in cancer cells. PNR was reported to be a novel regulator of ERα expression in breast cancer cells, and high PNR expression correlates with favorable response to tamoxifen treatment. Moreover, PNR was shown to increase p53 stability in HeLa cells, implying that PNR may be a therapeutic target in this and other cancers that retain a wild type p53 gene. To facilitate further understanding of PNR functions in cancer, we characterized compound 11a, a synthetic, putative PNR agonist in several cell-based assays. Interestingly, we showed that 11a failed to activate PNR and its cytotoxicity was independent of PNR expression, excluding PNR as a mediator for 11a cytotoxicity. Systematic analyses of the cytotoxic effects of 11a in NCI-60 cell lines revealed a strong positive correlation of cytotoxicity with p53 status, i.e., p53 wild type cell lines were significantly more sensitive to 11a than p53 mutated or null cell lines. Furthermore, using HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/- isogenic cell lines we revealed that the mechanism of 11a-induced cytotoxicity occurred through G1/S phase cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. In conclusion, we observed a correlation of 11a sensitivity with p53 status but not with PNR expression, suggesting that tumors expressing wild type p53 might be responsive to this compound.	0
Small-fiber neuropathy in pompe disease: first reported cases and prospective screening of a clinic cohort. ||  || Prior autopsy reports demonstrate glycogen deposition in Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves in patients with infantile and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), but little is known about associated clinical features. Here, we report the first confirmed cases of small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) in LOPD and present the results of a first attempt at screening for SFN in this patient population. After confirming small-fiber neuropathy in 2 LOPD patients, 44 consecutive Pompe patients (iOPD=7, LOPD n=37) presenting to the Duke University Glycogen Storage Disease Program between September 2013 and November 2014 were asked to complete the 21-item Small-Fiber Neuropathy Screening List (SFNSL), where a score of ≥11 is considered to be a positive screen. Fifty percent of patients had a positive SFN screen (mean score 11.6, 95% CI 9.0-14.2). A modest correlation between the SFNSL score and current age was seen (r=0.38, p=0.01), along with a correlation with duration of ERT (r=0.31, p=0.0495). Trends toward correlation with forced vital capacity and age at diagnosis were also present. Women had a higher mean SFNSL score (14.2) than men (8.2, p=0.017). SFN may occur in association with Pompe disease and precede the diagnosis. Further studies are needed to determine its true prevalence and impact.	1
Clinical features and prognostic implications of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy related to the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene. || Adolescent Adult Aging Cardiomegaly Carrier Proteins Female Humans Male Middle Aged Myocardium Myosin Heavy Chains Prognosis || Little information is available on phenotype-genotype correlations in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that are related to the cardiac myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) gene. The aim of this study was to perform this type of analysis. We studied 76 genetically affected subjects from nine families with seven recently identified mutations (SASint20, SDSint7, SDSint23, branch point int23, Glu542Gln, a deletion in exon 25, and a duplication/deletion in exon 33) in the MYBPC3 gene. Detailed clinical, ECG, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. An intergene analysis was performed by comparing the MYBPC3 group to seven mutations in the beta-myosin heavy-chain gene (beta-MHC) group (n=52). There was no significant phenotypic difference among the different mutations in the MYBPC3 gene. However, in the MYBPC3 group compared with the beta-MHC group, (1) prognosis was significantly better (P<0.0001), and no deaths occurred before the age of 40 years; (2) the age at onset of symptoms was delayed (41+/-19 versus 35+/-17 years, P<0.002); and (3) before 30 years of age, the phenotype was particularly mild because penetrance was low (41% versus 62%), maximal wall thicknesses lower (12+/-4 versus 16+/-7 mm, P<0.03), and abnormal T waves less frequent (9% versus 45%, P<0.02). These results are consistent with specific clinical features related to the MYBPC3 gene: onset of the disease appears delayed and the prognosis is better than that associated with the beta-MHC gene. These findings could be particularly important for the purpose of clinical management and genetic counseling in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	4
Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise occurs more frequently in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with the R92W troponin T mutation than in those with myosin mutations. || Adolescent Adult Aged Blood Pressure Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Death, Sudden, Cardiac Echocardiography Exercise Test Female Heart Rate Heterozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Risk Factors Troponin T Young Adult || Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise is reported to occur in up to a third of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases and is associated with an increased risk of death, particularly in the young, but it is not known whether the HCM-causing mutation influences blood pressure response to exercise. The purpose of this article is to ascertain whether the blood pressure response to exercise differs among carriers of the R92W mutation in the cardiac troponin T gene (TNNT2), which has been associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in young males; carriers of mutations in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7); and their noncarrier relatives. Thirty R92W(TNNT2) carriers, 51 MYH7 mutation carriers, and 68 of their noncarrier relatives were subjected to bicycle ergonometric exercise testing to assess blood pressure response to, as well as heart rate recovery after, exercise. Additional echocardiographic and demographic details were documented for all participants. R92W(TNNT2) carriers demonstrated significantly more abnormal blood pressure responses to exercise (P = .021; odds ratio 3.03; confidence interval 1.13-8.12) and smaller increases in systolic blood pressure than MYH7 mutation carriers or related noncarrier control individuals. Although abnormal blood pressure response occurred at similar frequencies in males in all groups (23%-26%), the percentage of R92W(TNNT2) females with abnormal blood pressure response was 64%, compared with 25% for MYH7 and 22% for noncarriers. Therefore, these results show that blood pressure response to exercise is influenced by genotype and gender in patients with HCM.	4
Experimental therapies in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Animals Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cardiovascular Agents Death, Sudden, Cardiac Drugs, Investigational Fibrosis Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Myocardium Phenotype Treatment Outcome || The quintessential clinical diagnostic phenotype of human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is primary cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy is also a major determinant of mortality and morbidity including the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with HCM. Reversal and attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and its accompanying fibrosis is expected to improve morbidity as well as decrease the risk of SCD in patients with HCM.The conventionally used pharmacological agents in treatment of patients with HCM have not been shown to reverse or attenuate established cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. An effective treatment of HCM has to target the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the pathogenesis of the phenotype. Mechanistic studies suggest that cardiac hypertrophy in HCM is secondary to activation of various hypertrophic signaling molecules and, hence, is potentially reversible. The hypothesis is supported by the results of genetic and pharmacological interventions in animal models. The results have shown potential beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan, mineralocorticoid receptor blocker spironolactone, 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors simvastatin and atorvastatin, and most recently, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on reversal or prevention of hypertrophy and fibrosis in HCM. The most promising results have been obtained with NAC, which through multiple thiol-responsive mechanisms completely reversed established cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in three independent studies. Pilot studies with losartan and statins in humans have established the feasibility of such studies. The results in animal models have firmly established the reversibility of established cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in HCM and have set the stage for advancing the findings in the animal models to human patients with HCM through conducting large-scale efficacy studies.	4
Genetic Spectrum of Idiopathic Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Uncovered by Next-Generation Sequencing. ||  || Cardiomyopathies represent a rare group of disorders often of genetic origin. While approximately 50% of genetic causes are known for other types of cardiomyopathies, the genetic spectrum of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic background of idiopathic RCM and to compile the obtained genetic variants to the novel signalling pathways using in silico protein network analysis. We used Illumina MiSeq setup to screen for 108 cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia-associated genes in 24 patients with idiopathic RCM. Pathogenicity of genetic variants was classified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classification. Pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants were detected in 13 of 24 patients resulting in an overall genotype-positive rate of 54%. Half of the genotype-positive patients carried a combination of pathogenic, likely-pathogenic variants and variants of unknown significance. The most frequent combination included mutations in sarcomeric and cytoskeletal genes (38%). A bioinformatics approach underlined the mechanotransducing protein networks important for RCM pathogenesis. Multiple gene mutations were detected in half of the RCM cases, with a combination of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal gene mutations being the most common. Mutations of genes encoding sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, and Z-line-associated proteins appear to have a predominant role in the development of RCM.	4
Mutant p53 protein expression and antioxidant status deficiency in breast cancer. ||  || It is well recognized that cancers develop and grow as a result of disordered function of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, which may be exploited for screening purposes. Extensive evidence indicated tumor suppressor protein p53 as candidate marker for mutation identification. We have investigated mutant p53 protein expression in human breast tumors in relation to antioxidant status deficiency. The study included 100 breast cancer patients. p53 protein expression was evaluated by Western blot assay and immunostaining using a CM-1, DO-7 and Pab240 antibodies. Antioxidant parameters and lipid peroxidation were estimated by biochemical analyses. Western blotting with epitopespecific monoclonal antibody Pab240 strongly suggests that nuclear extracts from breast cancer cells express mutant forms of p53. It is of interest that the mutant forms of p53 overexpression in conjunction with the appearance of nuclear bodies are observed in highly aggressive carcinomas. Expression of isoform Δp53 (45 kDa) and isoform of ~ 29 kDa were more common in cases with LN metastasis. These studies point out the molecular consequences of oxidative stress (lipid peroxides, LP, p<0.001) and antioxidant status deficiency (copper, zinc superoxid dismutase, SOD, p<0.001; catalase, CAT, p<0.01; glutathione reductase, GR, p<0.001; glutathione, GSH, p<0.05) and indicate the importance of p53 mutation as the commonest genetic alteration detected in breast cancer cells. The expression of mutant p53 is correlated to increased lipid peroxides (0.346, p<0.05 ) and lowered antioxidant activity of CAT (- 0.437, p<0.01) in the breast cancer patients.	0
Common molecular etiology of nonsyndromic hearing loss in 484 patients of 3 ethnicities in northwest China. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Deafness Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Sulfate Transporters Young Adult || In the study population in northwest China, a total of 33.06% of deaf patients have inherited hearing impairment caused by GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 1555A>G mutations. The mutation frequencies of GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 1555A>G genes were 16.12%, 10.54%, and 6.4%, respectively, in our study cohort. Thus, screening is conventionally performed for GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 1555A>G in these populations. This study aimed to investigate the mutations of GJB2, mitochondrial DNA 12S rRNA1555A>G, and SLC26A4 genes in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Tibetan ethnicities in patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in northwest China. A total of 484 unrelated subjects with hearing loss who attended special education schools in northwest China were enrolled in this study. Three prominent deafness-related genes, GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 1555A>G, were screened for mutations in our study cohort. The mutation frequencies of GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA 1555A>G genes were 16.12%, 10.54%, and 6.4%, respectively. The prevalence of GJB2 mutations was 17.52%, 15.35%, and 11.43% in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Tibetan participants, respectively. c.235delC was the most prevalent mutation, accounting for 65.71% of all GJB2 mutant alleles. The prevalence of SLC26A4 mutations was 12.39%, 8.84%, and 8.57% in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Tibetan participants, respectively. The c.919-2 A>G mutation was the most common form, accounting for 60.47% of all SLC26A4 mutant alleles. The prevalence of the homoplasmic mtDNA 1555A>G mutation was 8.97%, 3.72%, and 5.71% in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Tibetan participants, respectively, which represents a statistically significant difference between the Han Chinese and Hui people (χ(2) = 5.118, p < 0.05).	1
Identification of the genotypes causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in northern Sweden. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Light Chains Pedigree Phenotype Sweden Troponin I || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heterogenous disease, with variable genotypic and phenotypic expressions, often caused by mutations in sarcomeric protein genes. The aim of this study was to identify the genotypes and associated phenotypes related to HCM in northern Sweden. In 46 unrelated individuals with familial or sporadic HCM, mutation analysis of eight sarcomeric protein genes was performed; the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, cardiac myosin-binding protein C, cardiac troponin T, alpha-tropomyosin, cardiac essential and regulatory myosin light chains, cardiac troponin I and cardiac alpha-actin. A total of 11 mutations, of which six were novel ones, were found in 13 individuals. Seven mutations were located in the myosin-binding protein C gene, two in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene and one in the regulatory myosin light chain and troponin I genes, respectively. This is the first Swedish study, where a population with HCM has been genotyped. Mutations in the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene were the most common ones found in northern Sweden, whereas mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene were less frequent than previously described. There are differences in the phenotypes mediated by these genes characterised by a more late-onset disease for the myosin-binding protein C gene mutations. This should be taken into consideration, when evaluating clinical findings in the diagnosis of the disease, especially in young adults in families with HCM, where penetrance can be expected to be incomplete in the presence of a myosin-binding protein C gene mutation.	4
Impaired Osteogenesis of Disease-Specific Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Derived from a CFC Syndrome Patient. || Animals Cell Differentiation Cell Line Ectodermal Dysplasia Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Facies Failure to Thrive Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Mesenchymal Stem Cells Mice Mutation Osteoblasts Osteogenesis Phosphorylation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Signal Transduction Smad1 Protein Smad2 Protein || Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. However, little is known about how aberrant ERK signaling is associated with the defective bone development manifested in most CFC syndrome patients. In this study, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from dermal fibroblasts of a CFC syndrome patient having rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase B (BRAF) gain-of-function mutation. CFC-iPSCs were differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells (CFC-MSCs) and further induced to osteoblasts in vitro. The osteogenic defects of CFC-MSCs were revealed by alkaline phosphatase activity assay, mineralization assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting. Osteogenesis of CFC-MSCs was attenuated compared to wild-type (WT)-MSCs. In addition to activated ERK signaling, increased p-SMAD2 and decreased p-SMAD1 were observed in CFC-MSCs during osteogenesis. The defective osteogenesis of CFC-MSCs was rescued by inhibition of ERK signaling and SMAD2 signaling or activation of SMAD1 signaling. Importantly, activation of ERK signaling and SMAD2 signaling or inhibition of SMAD1 signaling recapitulated the impaired osteogenesis in WT-MSCs. Our findings indicate that SMAD2 signaling and SMAD1 signaling as well as ERK signaling are responsible for defective early bone development in CFC syndrome, providing a novel insight on the pathological mechanism and therapeutic targets.	0
Experience with cochlear implants in Greenlanders with profound hearing loss living in Greenland. || Adult Age Factors Child, Preschool Cochlear Implants Female Greenland Hearing Loss Humans Male Middle Aged Retrospective Studies || Cochlear implant (CI) treatment was introduced to the world in the 1980s and has become a routine treatment for congenital or acquired severe-to-profound hearing loss. CI treatment requires access to a highly skilled team of ear, nose and throat specialists, audiologists and speech-language pathologists for evaluation, surgery and rehabilitation. In particular, children treated with CI are in need of long-term post-operative auditory training and other follow-up support. The study is retrospective with updated information on present performance. Since 2001, a total of 11 Greenlandic patients living in Greenland have been treated with CI, 7 children and 4 adults. Of these children, 4 use oral communication only and are full-time CI-users, 2 with full-time use of CI are still in progress with use of oral communication, and 1 has not acquired oral language yet, but has started auditory and speech training. Six children attend mainstream public school while one child is in kindergarten. Of the adults, only 1 has achieved good speech perception with full-time use of CI while 3 do not use the CI. From an epidemiological point of view, approximately 1-3 children below 6 years are in need of a CI every second year in Greenland often due to sequelae from meningitis, which may cause postinfectious deafness. Screening of new-borns for hearing has been started in Greenland establishing the basis for early diagnosis of congenital hearing impairment and subsequent intervention. The logistics and lack of availability of speech therapists in Greenland hampers possibilities for optimal language and speech therapy of CI patients in Greenland. This study aims at describing the results of CI treatment in Greenlanders and the outcome of the CI operations along with the auditory and speech/language outcomes. Finally, we present a suggestion for the future CI treatment and recommendations for an increased effort in the treatment and rehabilitation of implanted patients in Greenland.	4
The role of the p53 tumor suppressor in metabolism and diabetes. || diabetes insulin resistance metabolism p53 || In the context of tumor suppression, p53 is an undisputedly critical protein. Functioning primarily as a transcription factor, p53 helps fend off the initiation and progression of tumors by inducing cell cycle arrest, senescence or programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cells at the earliest stages of precancerous development. Compelling evidence, however, suggests that p53 is involved in other aspects of human physiology, including metabolism. Indeed, recent studies suggest that p53 plays a significant role in the development of metabolic diseases, including diabetes, and further that p53's role in metabolism may also be consequential to tumor suppression. Here, we present a review of the literature on the role of p53 in metabolism, diabetes, pancreatic function, glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance. Additionally, we discuss the emerging role of genetic variation in the p53 pathway (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on the impact of p53 in metabolic disease and diabetes. A better understanding of the relationship between p53, metabolism and diabetes may one day better inform the existing and prospective therapeutic strategies to combat this rapidly growing epidemic.	0
Impact of NRAS Mutations on the Diagnosis of Follicular Neoplasm of the Thyroid. ||  || Background. Most patients with a preoperative diagnosis of thyroid follicular neoplasm (FN) undergo diagnostic surgery to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant. Point mutations at NRAS codon 61 are the most common mutations observed in FN. However, the clinical significance of NRAS mutation remains unclear. Methods. From 2012 to 2013, 123 consecutive patients undergoing thyroidectomy for FN were evaluated prospectively. Molecular analyses for NRAS codon 61 were performed with pyrosequencing. Results. The overall malignancy rate in FN was 48.8% (60/123). Of 123 FNs, 33 (26.8%) were positive for the NRAS mutation. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of a NRAS mutation-positive FN specimen to predict malignancy were 37%, 83%, 67%, and 58%, respectively. Patients with a NRAS-positive FN had a higher malignancy rate in additional thyroid nodules beyond the FN than patients with a NRAS-negative FN. The overall malignancy rate of patients with a NRAS-positive FN was significantly higher than that of patients with a NRAS-negative FN (79% versus 52%; P = 0.008). Conclusions. Determining NRAS mutation status in FN helps to improve the accuracy of thyroid cancer diagnosis and to predict cancer risk in accompanying thyroid nodules.	4
BRAF Mutants Evade ERK-Dependent Feedback by Different Mechanisms that Determine Their Sensitivity to Pharmacologic Inhibition. || Cell Line, Tumor Dimerization Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf ras Proteins || ERK signaling requires RAS-induced RAF dimerization and is limited by feedback. Activated BRAF mutants evade feedback inhibition of RAS by either of two mechanisms. BRAF V600 mutants are activated monomers when RAS activity is low; all other activating BRAF mutants function as constitutive RAS-independent dimers. RAF inhibitors effectively inhibit mutant monomers, but not dimers; their binding to one site in the dimer significantly reduces their affinity for the second. Tumors with non-V600E BRAF mutants are insensitive to these drugs, and increased expression of BRAF V600E dimers causes acquired resistance. A compound that equally inhibits both sites of mutant RAF dimers inhibits tumors driven by either class of mutants or those BRAF V600E tumors with dimer-dependent acquired resistance to monomer-specific inhibitors.	0
Phenotype description of a novel DFNA9/COCH mutation, I109T. || Adult Aged Audiometry, Pure-Tone Auditory Threshold DNA Mutational Analysis Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Linear Models Male Middle Aged Mutation Netherlands Pedigree Phenotype Proteins Vestibular Diseases || This is a report of the audiological and vestibular characteristics of a Dutch DFNA9 family with a novel mutation, I109T, in the LCCL domain of COCH. From the family with the novel I109T COCH mutation, audiometric data were collected and analyzed longitudinally. Results were compared to those obtained in previously identified P51 S, G88E, and G87W COCH mutation carriers. Special attention was also given to a comparison of age-related features such as progressive hearing loss and vestibular impairment. A novel mutation (I109T) in COCH segregates with hearing impairment and vestibular dysfunction in the present family. Pure tone thresholds, phoneme recognition scores, and vestibular responses of the I109T mutation carriers were essentially similar to those previously established in P51S, G87W, and G88E mutation carriers. Deterioration of hearing in the I109T mutation carriers started at 43 years of age, and vestibular function deteriorated at least 7 years later. The phenotype associated with the novel COCH (I109T) mutation is largely similar to that associated with P51S and G88E mutation carriers. However, subtle differences in terms of onset age and rate of progression seem to exist.	4
Expanding the SHOC2 mutation associated phenotype of Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair: structural brain anomalies and myelofibrosis. || Chiari 1 malformation Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair SHOC2 heterotopia malignancy myelofibrosis rasopathy || Noonan syndrome is a heterogenous rasopathy typically presenting with short stature, characteristic facial features, cardiac abnormalities including pulmonic valve stenosis, ASD and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cryptorchidism, ectodermal abnormalities, and learning differences. The phenotype is variable, and limited genotype phenotype correlation exists with SOS1 mutations often associated with normal cognition and stature, RAF1 mutations entailing a high HCM risk, and certain PTPN11 mutations predisposing to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The recently identified SHOC2 mutation (p.Ser2Gly) causes Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair. We report five patients with this mutation. All had skin hyperpigmentation, sparse light colored hair, increased fine wrinkles, ligamentous laxity, developmental delay, and 4/4 had a structural cardiac anomaly. Hypotonia and macrocephaly occurred in 4/5 (80%); 3/5 (60%) had polyhydramnios, increased birth weight or required use of a feeding tube. Distinctive brain abnormalities included relative megalencephaly and enlarged subarachnoid spaces suggestive of benign external hydrocephalus, and a relatively small posterior fossa as indicated by a vertical tentorium. The combination of a large brain with a small posterior fossa likely resulted in the high rate of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (3/4; 75%). Periventricular nodular heterotopia was seen in one patient with a thick and dysplastic corpus callosum. We report on the first hematologic neoplasm, myelofibrosis, in a 2-year-old patient with SHOC2 mutation. Myelofibrosis is exceedingly rare in children and young adults. The absence of a somatic JAK2 mutation, seen in the majority of patients with myelofibrosis, is noteworthy as it suggests that germline or somatic SHOC2 mutations are causally involved in myelofibrosis.	4
Non-genomic and Immune Evolution of Melanoma Acquiring MAPKi Resistance. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes DNA Methylation Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Profiling Humans Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1 MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Phosphoproteins Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases beta Catenin || Clinically acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapies for melanoma cannot be fully explained by genomic mechanisms and may be accompanied by co-evolution of intra-tumoral immunity. We sought to discover non-genomic mechanisms of acquired resistance and dynamic immune compositions by a comparative, transcriptomic-methylomic analysis of patient-matched melanoma tumors biopsied before therapy and during disease progression. Transcriptomic alterations across resistant tumors were highly recurrent, in contrast to mutations, and were frequently correlated with differential methylation of tumor cell-intrinsic CpG sites. We identified in the tumor cell compartment supra-physiologic c-MET up-expression, infra-physiologic LEF1 down-expression and YAP1 signature enrichment as drivers of acquired resistance. Importantly, high intra-tumoral cytolytic T cell inflammation prior to MAPKi therapy preceded CD8 T cell deficiency/exhaustion and loss of antigen presentation in half of disease-progressive melanomas, suggesting cross-resistance to salvage anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Thus, melanoma acquires MAPKi resistance with highly dynamic and recurrent non-genomic alterations and co-evolving intra-tumoral immunity.	0
Genetic and clinical analysis of nonsyndromic hearing impairment in pediatric and adult cases. ||  || Previous studies have linked GJB2 gene and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to nonsyndromic hearing impairment (NSHI), but no study in China has yet investigated these mutations across all age groups. To fill the gap, this study ascertained 263 patients with NSHI between ages 2 months and 60 years and analyzed the presence ofGJB2 gene and mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. A total of 20 types of mutations were detected for theGJB2 gene. TheGJB2 gene and mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 18.63 and 11.41% cases, respectively. At the first hospital visit,GJB2 gene mutations were detected in 5.97% of adult patients (>18 years) and 22.96% pediatric patients (<18 years) (χ2 =9.506,p = 0.002), and mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 31.34% of adult patients and 4.59% of pediatric patients (χ2 = 35.359,p <0.001). When patients were classified by age at onset of deafness, significantly more (20.68%) pediatric patients hadGJB2 gene mutations than did adult patients (0.0%) (χ2 = 4.685;p = 0.006). Mitochondrial DNA A1555G/C1494T mutations were detected in 15.38% of adult-onset and 8.86% pediatric-onset patients, respectively. Interestingly, mostGJB2 gene mutation carriers experienced NSHI onset within the first year of life (65.31%), while mtDNA A1555G/C1494T mutation carriers experienced onset at any age. Therefore,GJB2 gene mutations appear to contribute to congenital deafness, while mtDNAA1555G/C1494T mutations contribute mainly to acquired deafness in Chinese individuals. Both newborn hearing screening and genetic testing are important to diagnose and treat deafness.	4
The complexity of newborn screening follow-up in phenylketonuria. ||  || In the United States, and most developed nations, the newborn screening (NBS) panel covers many primary disorders of metabolism, including phenylketonuria (PKU). When an elevated phenylalanine level is identified, the infant is evaluated for PKU and should also be tested for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. A neonate presented with a phenylalanine level of 254 μmol/L (reference range <138 μmol/L) on newborn screening. The infant's confirmatory phenylalanine was 118 μmol/L (reference range <77 μmol/L). Her urine pterin profile was normal, and initially she had no measurable activity of red blood cell (RBC) dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR). Subsequent study revealed normal levels of CSF tetrahydrobiopterin and neurotransmitter metabolites, and by 18 months of age, her RBC DHPR activity was detectable at 0.5 nmol/min/mgHgb (reference range 0.8-3.9). Sequencing of the QDPR gene for DHPR revealed c.1A>T nucleotide substitution in exon 3 expressed as "p.MET1?" Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene sequencing revealed compound heterozygosity for L249F and A300S. Although initial testing suggested the child was affected with DHPR deficiency, further analysis, finding increasing levels of DHPR activity and PAH compound mutant heterozygosity, indicated that the primary disorder is mild hyperphenylalaninemia with carrier status for DHPR deficiency. This is an example of newborn screening results leading to confusing findings requiring extensive biochemical studies and genotyping in order to arrive at the appropriate diagnosis.	1 3
Exploring the potential of a structural alphabet-based tool for mining multiple target conformations and target flexibility insight. || Animals Catalytic Domain HIV Protease Humans Plasminogen Activators Protein Binding Protein Conformation Sequence Analysis, Protein Software Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Protein flexibility is often implied in binding with different partners and is essential for protein function. The growing number of macromolecular structures in the Protein Data Bank entries and their redundancy has become a major source of structural knowledge of the protein universe. The analysis of structural variability through available redundant structures of a target, called multiple target conformations (MTC), obtained using experimental or modeling methods and under different biological conditions or different sources is one way to explore protein flexibility. This analysis is essential to improve the understanding of various mechanisms associated with protein target function and flexibility. In this study, we explored structural variability of three biological targets by analyzing different MTC sets associated with these targets. To facilitate the study of these MTC sets, we have developed an efficient tool, SA-conf, dedicated to capturing and linking the amino acid and local structure variability and analyzing the target structural variability space. The advantage of SA-conf is that it could be applied to divers sets composed of MTCs available in the PDB obtained using NMR and crystallography or homology models. This tool could also be applied to analyze MTC sets obtained by dynamics approaches. Our results showed that SA-conf tool is effective to quantify the structural variability of a MTC set and to localize the structural variable positions and regions of the target. By selecting adapted MTC subsets and comparing their variability detected by SA-conf, we highlighted different sources of target flexibility such as induced by binding partner, by mutation and intrinsic flexibility. Our results support the interest to mine available structures associated with a target using to offer valuable insight into target flexibility and interaction mechanisms. The SA-conf executable script, with a set of pre-compiled binaries are available at http://www.mti.univ-paris-diderot.fr/recherche/plateformes/logiciels.	0
Targeting the p53 signaling pathway in cancer therapy - the promises, challenges and perils. ||  || Research over the past three decades has identified p53 as a multi-functional transcription factor. p53 influences myriad, highly diverse cellular processes, and represents one of the most important and extensively studied tumor suppressors. Activated by various stresses, p53 blocks cancer progression by provoking transient or permanent growth arrest, by enabling DNA repair, or by advancing cellular death programs. This anti-cancer activity profile, together with genomic and mutational analyses documenting inactivation of p53 in more than 50% of human cancers, motivated drug development efforts to (re-) activate p53 in established tumors. The complexities of p53 signaling in cancer are summarized, including current strategies and challenges to restore p53's tumor suppressive function in established tumors, to inactivate p53 inhibitors, and to restore wild type function of p53 mutant proteins. p53 represents an attractive target for the development of anti-cancer therapies. Whether p53 is 'druggable', however, remains an area of active research and discussion, as p53 has pro-survival functions and chronic p53 activation accelerates aging, which may compromise the long-term homeostasis of an organism. The complex biology and dual functions of p53 in cancer prevention and age-related cellular responses pose significant challenges to the development of p53-targeting cancer therapies.	0
Pathogenic substitution of IVS15 + 5G > A in SLC26A4 in patients of Okinawa Islands with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome or Pendred syndrome. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Female Genetics, Population Goiter, Nodular Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Infant Islands Japan Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Mutation Rate Pedigree Phenotype RNA Splicing Radiography Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Sulfate Transporters Temporal Bone Vestibular Aqueduct Young Adult || Pendred syndrome (PS) and nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) are caused by SLC26A4 mutations. The Okinawa Islands are the southwestern-most islands of the Japanese archipelago. And ancestral differences have been reported between people from Okinawa Island and those from the main islands of Japan. To confirm the ethnic variation of the spectrum of SLC26A4 mutations, we investigated the frequencies of SLC26A4 mutations and clinical manifestations of patients with EVA or PS living in the Okinawa Islands. We examined 22 patients with EVA or PS from 21 unrelated families in Okinawa Islands. The patient's clinical history, findings of physical and otoscopic examinations, hearing test, and computed tomography (CT) scan of the temporal bones were recorded. To detect mutations, all 21 exons and the exon-intron junctions of SLC26A4 were sequenced for all subjects. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for SLC26A4 and calculations using the comparative CT (2(-ΔΔCT)) method were used to determine the pathogenicity associated with gene substitutions. SLC26A4 mutations were identified in 21 of the 22 patients. We found a compound heterozygous mutation for IVS15 + 5G > A/H723R in nine patients (41%), a homozygous substitution of IVS15 + 5G > A in six patients (27%), and homozygous mutation for H723R in five patients (23%). The most prevalent types of SLC26A4 alleles were IVS15 + 5G > A and H723R, which both accounted for 15/22 (68%) of the patients. There were no significant correlations between the types of SLC26A4 mutation and clinical manifestations. Based on qRT-PCR results, expression of SLC26A4 was not identified in patients with the homozygous substitution of IVS15 + 5G > A. The substitution of IVS15 + 5G > A in SLC26A4 was the most common mutation in uniquely found in patients with PS and EVA in Okinawa Islands. This suggested that the spectrum of SLC26A4 mutation differed from main islands of Japan and other East Asian countries. The substitution of IVS15 + 5G > A leads to a loss of SLC26A expression and results in a phenotype of PS and EVA.	1
Germline TP53 mutational spectrum in French Canadians with breast cancer. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Breast Neoplasms Canada Child Child, Preschool European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Quebec Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Specific germline mutations in the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility (HBC/HBOC) genes, BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2, have been shown to recur in French Canadians of Quebec, Canada, and this has been attributed to common ancestors. Germline TP53 mutation carriers are known to segregate in Li-Fraumeni syndrome families, which feature young age of onset breast cancer. We have reported rare TP53 mutation carriers in French Canadian HBC families, though none recurred possibly due to the limited number of cancer families investigated. Here we describe TP53 germline mutations found in French Canadian cancer families provided from hereditary cancer clinics; investigate 37 new BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative HBC/HBOC families for the TP53 mutations; and assess the frequency of TP53 mutations in a 1235 French Canadian breast cancer cases not selected for family history of cancer. TP53 mutation-positive pedigrees from French Canadian cancer families were provided from local hereditary cancer clinics. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of all protein encoding exons of TP53 was performed using peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from breast/ovarian cancer probands from 37 HBC/HBOC families of French Canadian descent. Targeted bidirectional Sanger sequencing assay of regions containing the identified TP53 mutations was performed on 1235 French Canadian breast cancer cases not selected for family history cancer. Five new TP53 mutations were identified in six pedigrees from hereditary cancer clinics. No deleterious mutations were identified in cancer probands from 37 HBC/HBOC families. A targeted mutation screen of the 1235 breast cancer cases identified a c.844C>T [p.Arg282Trp] mutation carrier. This mutation was also found among the six mutation-positive cancer families provided by the local hereditary cancer clinics. The targeted screen also uncovered a new TP53 mutation, c.685T>C [p.Cys229Arg] that was found in two breast cancer cases. All TP53 mutation carriers were among the 656 women with breast cancer diagnosed less than 50 years of age. In all six new TP53 mutations were identified in French Canadians, where two each occurred in independently ascertained cases/families. Although all newly identified breast cancer mutation carriers reported a family history of cancer, none were consistent with features of Li-Fraumeni syndrome families.	4
A simple and rapid polymerase chain reaction-based method for detecting a prevalent mutation (R413P) in Japanese phenylketonuria patients. ||  || A convenient molecular method for the detection of R413P (1238G-->C) mutation in exon 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, one of the prevalent mutations among Japanese patients with classical phenylketonuria (PKU) is described. The mutation was previously detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing or allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization. However, these methods were cumbersome and only a few laboratories could provide such a diagnostic service. An improved version of the method has been developed here, involving 30 cycles of PCR following restriction enzyme digestion. In the upstream primer encompassing G-1207 to C-1237, two substitutions are artificially introduced, so that a Bam-HI site involving C-1238 is introduced in the copies of the mutant allele. With the use of this method, R413P-homozygote and -heterozygote can be readily and unequivocally distinguished from normal using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Among 10 Japanese PKU patients investigated, three were homozygous and three were heterozygous for the R413P allele, whereas four did not carry this mutant allele, indicating that the prevalence of the mutant allele is 45%. The result suggests that it is technically feasible to develop a program for carrier detection of the mutation in the Japanese population.	3
Intrinsically active MEK variants are differentially regulated by proteinases and phosphatases. ||  || MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 are central signaling proteins that serve as specificity determinants of the MAPK/ERK cascade. More than twenty activating mutations have been reported for MEK1/2, and many of them are known to cause diseases such as cancers, arteriovenous malformation and RASopathies. Changes in their intrinsic activity do not seem to correlate with the severity of the diseases. Here we studied four MEK1/2 mutations using biochemical and molecular dynamic methods. Although the studied mutants elevated the activating phosphorylation of MEK they had no effect on the stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Studying the regulatory mechanism that may explain this lack of effect, we found that one type of mutation affects MEK stability and two types of mutations demonstrate a reduced sensitivity to PP2A. Together, our results indicate that some MEK mutations exert their function not only by their elevated intrinsic activity, but also by modulation of regulatory elements such as protein stability or dephosphorylation.	0
Chemical Variations on the p53 Reactivation Theme. ||  || Among the tumor suppressor genes, p53 is one of the most studied. It is widely regarded as the "guardian of the genome", playing a major role in carcinogenesis. In fact, direct inactivation of the TP53 gene occurs in more than 50% of malignancies, and in tumors that retain wild-type p53 status, its function is usually inactivated by overexpression of negative regulators (e.g., MDM2 and MDMX). Hence, restoring p53 function in cancer cells represents a valuable anticancer approach. In this review, we will present an updated overview of the most relevant small molecules developed to restore p53 function in cancer cells through inhibition of the p53-MDMs interaction, or direct targeting of wild-type p53 or mutated p53. In addition, optimization approaches used for the development of small molecules that have entered clinical trials will be presented.	0
GJB2 mutations in patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss from Croatia. || Connexin 26 Connexins Croatia Exons Gene Frequency Hearing Loss Humans Mutation || The aim of the study was to determine (1) the frequency and type of mutations in the coding region of the GJB2 gene (sequencing), (2) the frequency of splice site mutation IVS1 + 1G > A in the GJB2 gene (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis), (3) possible copy number changes in the GJB2, GJB3, GJB6, and WFS1 genes (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis), and (4) the frequency of del(GJB6-D13S1830) in the GJB6 gene in 58 unrelated patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss from Croatia. About 44.8% of our patients presented with mutation in the GJB2 gene. We identified seven sequence variations. Six of them had previously been reported as disease related (35delG, W24X, V37I, L90P, 313del14, and IVS1 + 1G > A), and we report here for the first time one novel variant, -24A > C. We detected the greatest frequency of 35delG allele compared to the other alleles (35.3%). Allelic frequencies of other common mutations accounted for 2.6-0.9% of analyzed chromosomes. Neither GJB6 deletion nor copy number changes in the GJB2, GJB3, GJB6, and WFS1 genes were found. The 35delG/35delG genotype was associated with severe to profound hearing loss in 94% of 35delG homozygotes. High mutation rate (44%) indicates that testing of the GJB2 gene will clarify the genetic cause in almost half of the cases of recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in Croatia.	4
The genetic spectrum of familial hypercholesterolemia in south-eastern Poland. || Adult Apolipoproteins B Cholesterol Cholesterol, LDL Exons Female Humans Hypercholesterolemia Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Poland Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Receptors, LDL Serine Endopeptidases || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with a frequency of 1 in 200 to 500 in most European populations. Mutations in LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes are known to cause FH. In this study, we analyzed the genetic spectrum of the disease in the understudied Polish population. 161 unrelated subjects with a clinical diagnosis of FH from the south-eastern region of Poland were recruited. High resolution melt and direct sequencing of PCR products were used to screen 18 exons of LDLR, a region of exon 26 in the APOB gene and exon 7 of PCSK9. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to detect gross deletions and insertions in LDLR. Genotypes of six LDL-C raising SNPs were used for a polygenic gene score calculation. We found 39 different pathogenic mutations in the LDLR gene with 10 of them being novel. 13 (8%) individuals carried the p.Arg3527Gln mutation in APOB, and overall the detection rate was 43.4%. Of the patients where no mutation could be found, 53 (84.1%) had a gene score in the top three quartiles of the healthy comparison group suggesting that they have a polygenic cause for their high cholesterol. These results confirm the genetic heterogeneity of FH in Poland, which should be considered when designing a diagnostic strategy in the country. As in the UK, in the majority of patients where no mutation can be found, there is likely to be a polygenic cause of their high cholesterol level.	4
The BAG3 gene variants in Polish patients with dilated cardiomyopathy: four novel mutations and a genotype-phenotype correlation. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Base Sequence Cardiomyopathy, Dilated DNA Primers Exons Female Genotype Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Poland Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction || BAG3 gene mutations have been recently implicated as a novel cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of BAG3 mutations in Polish patients with DCM and to search for genotype-phenotype correlations. We studied 90 unrelated probands by direct sequencing of BAG3 exons and splice sites. Large deletions/insertions were screened for by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We found 5 different mutations in 6 probands and a total of 21 mutations among their relatives: the known p.Glu455Lys mutation (2 families), 4 novel mutations: p.Gln353ArgfsX10 (c.1055delC), p.Gly379AlafsX45 (c.1135delG), p.Tyr451X (c.1353C>A) and a large deletion of 17,990 bp removing BAG3 exons 3-4. Analysis of mutation positive relatives of the probands from this study pooled with those previously reported showed higher DCM prevalence among those with missense vs. truncating mutations (OR = 8.33, P = 0.0058) as well as a difference in age at disease onset between the former and the latter in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P = 0.006). Clinical data from our study suggested that in BAG3 mutation carriers acute onset DCM with hemodynamic compromise may be triggered by infection. BAG3 point mutations and large deletions are relatively frequent cause of DCM. Delayed DCM onset associated with truncating vs. non-truncating mutations may be important for genetic counseling.	4
[Two new mutations in the gene that codes for acid alpha-glucosidase in an adolescent with late-onset Pompe disease]. ||  || INTRODUCTION. Glycogen storage disease type II, or Pompe disease, is a lysosomal disease with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Late-onset Pompe disease is a progressive metabolic myopathy caused by decreased activity of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), which gives rise to reduced degradation and later accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes and cell cytoplasm. CASE REPORT. A 16-year-old Venezuelan male, diagnosed with late-onset glycogen storage disease type II, or Pompe disease, based on the patient's clinical picture and the biochemical findings. The patient presented unmistakable signs of muscular atrophy in the upper and lower limbs, as well as positive Gowers' sign. Levels of creatinkinase in serum were high. His functional respiratory capacity was diminished. The quantification of the enzymatic activity of acid alpha-glucosidase on filter paper did not show any significant decrease in activity. A molecular genetic analysis revealed the existence of two homozygotic mutations in the gene GAA, c.547-67C>G and c.547-39T>G, both on exon 2 of chromosome 17. According to the human genome database and the review that was undertaken, the changes detected in this patient represent new mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene, GAA. This claim is in agreement with the clinical features and biochemical changes found in the patient. CONCLUSION. A molecular genetic study is mandatory in patients suspected of having this disease.	1
Analysis of somatic mutations across the kinome reveals loss-of-function mutations in multiple cancer types. || Animals Checkpoint Kinase 2 Databases, Genetic Humans Loss of Function Mutation Mice NIH 3T3 Cells Neoplasms Phosphotransferases Receptor, ErbB-2 Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type I Reproducibility of Results Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 || In this study we use somatic cancer mutations to identify important functional residues within sets of related genes. We focus on protein kinases, a superfamily of phosphotransferases that share homologous sequences and structural motifs and have many connections to cancer. We develop several statistical tests for identifying Significantly Mutated Positions (SMPs), which are positions in an alignment with mutations that show signs of selection. We apply our methods to 21,917 mutations that map to the alignment of human kinases and identify 23 SMPs. SMPs occur throughout the alignment, with many in the important A-loop region, and others spread between the N and C lobes of the kinase domain. Since mutations are pooled across the superfamily, these positions may be important to many protein kinases. We select eleven mutations from these positions for functional validation. All eleven mutations cause a reduction or loss of function in the affected kinase. The tested mutations are from four genes, including two tumor suppressors (TGFBR1 and CHEK2) and two oncogenes (KDR and ERBB2). They also represent multiple cancer types, and include both recurrent and non-recurrent events. Many of these mutations warrant further investigation as potential cancer drivers.	0
Spectrum of genetic changes in patients with non-syndromic hearing impairment and extremely high carrier frequency of 35delG GJB2 mutation in Belarus. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Genotype Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Infant Male Mutation Republic of Belarus Young Adult || The genetic nature of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has so far been studied for many ethnic groups in various parts of the world. The single-nucleotide guanine deletion (35delG) of the GJB2 gene coding for connexin 26 was shown to be the main genetic cause of autosomal recessive deafness among Europeans. Here we present the results of the first study of GJB2 and three mitochondrial mutations among two groups of Belarusian inhabitants: native people with normal hearing (757 persons) and 391 young patients with non-syndromic SNHL. We have found an extremely high carrier frequency of 35delG GJB2 mutation in Belarus -5.7%. This point deletion has also been detected in 53% of the patients with SNHL. The 312del14 GJB2 was the second most common mutation in the Belarus patient cohort. Mitochondrial A1555G mt-RNR1 substitution was found in two SNHL patients (0.55%) but none were found in the population cohort. No individuals carried the A7445G mutation of mitochondrial mt-TS1. G7444A as well as T961G substitutions were detected in mitochondrial mt-RNR1 at a rate of about 1% both in the patient and population cohorts. A possible reason for Belarusians having the highest mutation carrier frequency in Europe 35delG is discussed.	4
Ultraslow oligomerization equilibria of p53 and its implications. || Amino Acid Substitution Binding, Competitive Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 DNA Humans Kinetics Mutant Proteins Protein Binding Protein Multimerization Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization Thermodynamics Time Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 bcl-2-Associated X Protein || The tumor suppressor p53 is in equilibrium at cellular concentrations between dimers and tetramers. Oncogenic mutant p53 (mut) exerts a dominant-negative effect on co-expression of p53 wild-type (wt) and mut alleles in cancer cells. It is believed that wt and mut form hetero-tetramers of attenuated activity, via their tetramerization domains. Using electrospray mass spectrometry on isotopically labeled samples, we measured directly the composition and rates of formation of p53 complexes in the presence and absence of response element DNA. The dissociation of tetramers was unexpectedly very slow (t(1/2) = 40 min) at 37 degrees C, matched by slow association of dimers, which is approximately four times longer than the half-life of spontaneous denaturation of wt p53. On mixing wt tetramers with the oncogenic contact mutant R273H of low DNA affinity, we observed the same slow formation of only wt(4), wt(2)mut(2), and mut(4), in the ratio 1:2:1, on a cellular time scale. On mixing wt and mut with response element DNAs P21 and BAX, we observed only the complexes wt(4)xDNA, wt(2)mut(2)xDNA, and mut(4)xDNA, with relative dissociation constants 1:4:71 and 1:13:85, respectively, accounting for the dominant-negative effect by weakened affinity. p53 dimers assemble rapidly to tetramers on binding to response element DNA, initiated by the p53 DNA binding domains. The slow oligomerization of free p53, competing with spontaneous denaturation, has implications for the possible regulation of p53 by binding proteins and DNA that affect tetramerization kinetics as well as equilibria.	0
Molecular profiling of metastatic colorectal tumors using next-generation sequencing: a single-institution experience. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms Female Gene Amplification Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Staging Proto-Oncogene Proteins Retrospective Studies || Recent molecular characterization of colorectal tumors has identified several molecular alterations of interest that are considered targetable in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We conducted a single-institution, retrospective study based on comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors from 138 patients with mCRC using next-generation sequencing (NGS) via FoundationOne. Overall, RAS mutations were present in 51.4% and RAF mutations were seen in 7.2% of mCRC patients. We found a novel KRASR68S1 mutation associated with an aggressive phenotype. RAS amplifications (1.4% KRAS and 0.7% NRAS), MET amplifications (2.2%), BRAFL597Ralterations (0.7%), ARAFS214F alterations (0.7%), and concurrent RAS+RAF (1.4%), BRAF+RAF1 (0.7%), and rare PTEN-PIK3CA-AKT pathway mutations were identified and predominantly associated with poor prognosis. ERBB2 (HER2) amplified tumors were identified in 5.1% and all arose from the rectosigmoid colon. Three cases (2.2%) were associated with a hypermutated profile that was corroborated with findings of high tumor mutational burden (TMB): 2 cases with MSI-H and 1 case with a POLE mutation. Comprehensive genomic profiling can uncover alterations beyond the well-characterized RAS/RAF mutations associated with anti-EGFR resistance. ERBB2 amplified tumors commonly originate from the rectosigmoid colon, are predominantly RAS/BRAF wild-type, and may predict benefit to HER2-directed therapy. Hypermutant tumors or tumors with high TMB correlate with MSI-H status or POLE mutations and may predict a benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy.	4
AKT inhibitors promote cell death in cervical cancer through disruption of mTOR signaling and glucose uptake. || Antineoplastic Agents Cell Death Cell Line, Tumor Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Cyclohexanones Female Glucose Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring Humans Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Pyridines Signal Transduction TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases Uterine Cervical Neoplasms || PI3K/AKT pathway alterations are associated with incomplete response to chemoradiation in human cervical cancer. This study was performed to test for mutations in the PI3K pathway and to evaluate the effects of AKT inhibitors on glucose uptake and cell viability. Mutational analysis of DNA from 140 pretreatment tumor biopsies and 8 human cervical cancer cell lines was performed. C33A cells (PIK3CAR88Q and PTENR233*) were treated with increasing concentrations of two allosteric AKT inhibitors (SC-66 and MK-2206) with or without the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). Cell viability and activation status of the AKT/mTOR pathway were determined in response to the treatment. Glucose uptake was evaluated by incubation with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Cell migration was assessed by scratch assay. Activating PIK3CA (E545K, E542K) and inactivating PTEN (R233*) mutations were identified in human cervical cancer. SC-66 effectively inhibited AKT, mTOR and mTOR substrates in C33A cells. SC-66 inhibited glucose uptake via reduced delivery of Glut1 and Glut4 to the cell membrane. SC-66 (1 µg/ml-56%) and MK-2206 (30 µM-49%) treatment decreased cell viability through a non-apoptotic mechanism. Decreases in cell viability were enhanced when AKT inhibitors were combined with 2-DG. The scratch assay showed a substantial reduction in cell migration upon SC-66 treatment. The mutational spectrum of the PI3K/AKT pathway in cervical cancer is complex. AKT inhibitors effectively block mTORC1/2, decrease glucose uptake, glycolysis, and decrease cell viability in vitro. These results suggest that AKT inhibitors may improve response to chemoradiation in cervical cancer.	0
A Korean family with the Muenke syndrome. || Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Hypertelorism Korea Male Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Skull Syndrome Treatment Outcome || The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The birth prevalence is approximately one in 10,000 live births, accounting for 8-10% of patients with coronal synostosis. Although MS is a relatively common diagnosis in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes, with autosomal dominant inheritance, there has been no report of MS, in an affected Korean family with typical cephalo-facial morphology that has been confirmed by molecular studies. Here, we report a familial case of MS in a female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of the FGFR3 gene. This patient had mild midfacial hypoplasia, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, a beak shaped nose, plagio-brachycephaly, and mild neurodevelopmental delay. The same mutation was confirmed in the patient's mother, two of the mother's sisters and the maternal grandfather. The severity of the cephalo-facial anomalies was variable among these family members.	4
Radiosensitisation of human colorectal cancer cells by ruthenium(II) arene anticancer complexes. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Damage DNA Repair Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Humans Organometallic Compounds Organoplatinum Compounds Oxaliplatin Radiation Tolerance Ruthenium Solutions Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Some of the largest improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with solid cancers observed over the past 3 decades have been from concurrent treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT). The lethal effects of RT on cancer cells arise primarily from damage to DNA. Ruthenium (Ru) is a transition metal of the platinum group, with potentially less toxicity than platinum drugs. We postulated that ruthenium-arene complexes are radiosensitisers when used in combination with RT. We screened 14 ruthenium-arene complexes and identified AH54 and AH63 as supra-additive radiosensitisers by clonogenic survival assays and isobologram analyses. Both complexes displayed facial chirality. At clinically relevant doses of RT, radiosensitisation of cancer cells by AH54 and AH63 was p53-dependent. Radiation enhancement ratios for 5-10 micromolar drug concentrations ranged from 1.19 to 1.82. In p53-wildtype cells, both drugs induced significant G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Colorectal cancer cells deficient in DNA damage repair proteins, EME1 and MUS81, were significantly more sensitive to both agents. Both drugs were active in cancer cell lines displaying acquired resistance to oxaliplatin or cisplatin. Our findings broaden the potential scope for these drugs for use in cancer therapy, including combination with radiotherapy to treat colorectal cancer.	0
The heart-liver metabolic axis: defective communication exacerbates disease. || Animals Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Female Liver Male Myocardium || The heart has been recognized as an endocrine organ for over 30 years (de Bold, 2011); however, little is known about how the heart communicates with other organs in the body, and even less is known about this process in the diseased heart. In this issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine, Magida and Leinwand (2014) introduce the concept that a primary genetic defect in the heart results in aberrant hepatic lipid metabolism, which consequently exacerbates hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This study provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that crosstalk occurs between the heart and liver, and that this becomes disrupted in the diseased state.	4
Heterozygous p53(V172F) mutation in cisplatin-resistant human tumor cells promotes MDM4 recruitment and decreases stability and transactivity of p53. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cisplatin DNA Damage Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Heterozygote Humans Mutation Nuclear Proteins Ovarian Neoplasms Protein Stability Proto-Oncogene Proteins Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Cisplatin is an important antitumor agent, but its clinical utility is often limited by multifactorial mechanism of resistance. Loss of tumor suppressor p53 function is a major mechanism that is affected by either mutation in the DNA-binding domain or dysregulation by overexpression of p53 inhibitors MDM2 and MDM4, which destabilize p53 by increasing its proteosomal degradation. In the present study, cisplatin-resistant 2780CP/Cl-16 ovarian tumor cells expressed a heterozygous, temperature-sensitive p53(V172F) mutation, which reduced p53 half-life by two- to threefold compared with homozygous wild-type (wt) p53 in parental A2780 cells. Although reduced p53 stability in 2780CP/Cl-16 cells was associated with moderate cellular overexpression of MDM2 or MDM4 (<1.5-fold), their binding to p53 was substantially enhanced (five- to eightfold). The analogous cisplatin-resistant 2780CP/Cl-24 cells, which express loss of p53 heterozygosity, retained the p53(V172F) mutation and high p53-MDM4 binding, but demonstrated lower p53-bound MDM2 that was associated with reduced p53 ubiquitination and enhanced p53 stability. The inference that p53 was unstable as a heteromeric p53(wt)/p53(V172F) complex was confirmed in 2780CP/Cl-24 cells transfected with wt p53 or multimer-inhibiting p53(L344P) mutant, and further supported by normalization of p53 stability in both resistant cell lines grown at the permissive temperature of 32.5 °C. Surprisingly, in 2780CP/Cl-16 and 2780CP/Cl-24 models, cisplatin-induced transactivity of p53 was attenuated at 37 °C, and this correlated with cisplatin resistance. However, downregulation of MDM2 or MDM4 by small interfering RNA in either resistant cell line induced p53 and restored p21 transactivation at 37 °C, as did cisplatin-induced DNA damage at 32.5 °C that coincided with reduced p53-MDM4 binding and cisplatin resistance. These results demonstrate that cisplatin-mediated p53(V172F) mutation regulates p53 stability at the normothermic temperature, but it is the increased recruitment of MDM4 by the homomeric or heteromeric mutant p53(V172F) complex that inhibits p53-dependent transactivation. This represents a novel cellular mechanism of p53 inhibition, and, thereby, induction of cisplatin resistance.	0
Extended mutation spectrum of Usher syndrome in Finland. || Adult DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Female Finland Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Myosins Pedigree Prevalence Usher Syndromes || The Finnish distribution of clinical Usher syndrome (USH) types is 40% USH3, 34% USH1 and 12% USH2. All patients with USH3 carry the founder mutation in clarin 1 (CLRN1), whereas we recently reported three novel myosin VIIA (MYO7A) mutations in two unrelated patients with USH1. This study was carried out to further investigate the USH mutation spectrum in Finnish patients. We analysed samples from nine unrelated USH patients/families without known mutations and two USH3 families with atypically severe phenotype. The Asper Ophthalmics USH mutation chip was used to screen for known mutations and to evaluate the chip in molecular diagnostics of Finnish patients. The chip revealed a heterozygous usherin (USH2A) mutation, p.N346H, in one patient. Sequencing of MYO7A and/or USH2A in three index patients revealed two novel heterozygous mutations, p.R873W in MYO7A and c.14343+2T>C in USH2A. We did not identify definite pathogenic second mutations in the patients, but identified several probably nonpathogenic variations that may modify the disease phenotype. Possible digenism could not be excluded in two families segregating genomic variations in both MYO7A and USH2A, and two families with CLRN1 and USH2A. We conclude that there is considerable genetic heterogeneity of USH1 and USH2 in Finland, making molecular diagnostics and genetic counselling of patients and families challenging.	4
Familial hypercholesterolemia: Molecular characterization of possible cases from the Azores Islands (Portugal). ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of the cholesterol metabolism, which constitutes a risk factor for coronary arterial disease (CAD). In the Azores Islands (Portugal), where mortality from CAD doubles its rate comparatively to the rest of the country and where a high frequency of dyslipidemia has been reported, the prevalence and distribution of FH remain unknown. The molecular characterization of a group of 33 possible cases of FH of Azorean background was undertaken in this study. A DNA array was initially used to search mutations in the LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 loci in 10 unrelated possible cases of FH. No mutations were detected in the array; after sequencing the full LDLR gene, 18 variants were identified, corresponding to two missense (c.806G > A; c.1171G > A) and sixteen synonymous alterations. Six of the synonymous variants which are consistently described in the literature as associated with altered cholesterol levels were used to build haplotypes. The most frequent haplotype corresponded to TTCGCC (45%), a "risk" haplotype, formed exclusively by alleles that were reported to increase cholesterol levels. Some of the variants detected in the full sequencing of the LDLR gene fell within the ligand-binding domain of this gene, defined by exons 2 to 6. To add information as to the role of such variants, these exons were sequenced in the remaining 23 possible FH cases. Two missense alterations (c.185C > T; c.806G > A) were found in this subset of possible FH cases. The missense alteration c.185C > T, identified in one individual, is novel for the Portuguese population. In silico analysis was not conclusive for this alteration, whose role will have to be further investigated. This study represents the first approach to the establishment of the mutational profile of FH in the Azores Islands.	4
Tracheal cartilaginous sleeves in children with syndromic craniosynostosis. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adolescent Adult Cartilage Child Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses Female Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Male Mutation Nuclear Proteins Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Trachea Twist-Related Protein 1 || Because a tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS) confers a significant mortality risk that can be mitigated with appropriate intervention, we sought to describe the prevalence and associated genotypes in a large cohort of children with syndromic craniosynostosis. Chart review of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis across two institutions. In a cohort of 86 patients with syndromic craniosynostosis, 31 required airway evaluation under anesthesia. TCS was found in 19, for an overall prevalence of 22%. FGFR2, TWIST1, and FGFR3 mutations were identified in children with TCS. All five children with a W290C mutation in FGFR2 had TCS, and most previously reported children with W290C had identification of TCS or early death. In contrast, TCS was not associated with other mutations at residue 290. There is an association between TCS and syndromic craniosynostosis, and it appears to be particularly high in individuals with the W290C mutation in FGFR2. Referral to a pediatric otolaryngologist and consideration of operative airway evaluation (i.e., bronchoscopy or rigid endoscopy) in all patients with syndromic craniosynostosis should be considered to evaluate for TCS. Results from genetic testing may help providers weigh the risks and benefits of early airway evaluation and intervention in children with higher-risk genotypes.Genet Med 19 1, 62-68.	4
The Molecular Mechanisms of Mutations in Actin and Myosin that Cause Inherited Myopathy. || Actins Age of Onset Gene Expression Regulation Humans Muscle, Skeletal Muscular Diseases Mutation Myosins Phenotype || The discovery that mutations in myosin and actin genes, together with mutations in the other components of the muscle sarcomere, are responsible for a range of inherited muscle diseases (myopathies) has revolutionized the study of muscle, converting it from a subject of basic science to a relevant subject for clinical study and has been responsible for a great increase of interest in muscle studies. Myopathies are linked to mutations in five of the myosin heavy chain genes, three of the myosin light chain genes, and three of the actin genes. This review aims to determine to what extent we can explain disease phenotype from the mutant genotype. To optimise our chances of finding the right mechanism we must study a myopathy where there are a large number of different mutations that cause a common phenotype and so are likely to have a common mechanism: a corollary to this criterion is that if any mutation causes the disease phenotype but does not correspond to the proposed mechanism, then the whole mechanism is suspect. Using these criteria, we consider two cases where plausible genotype-phenotype mechanisms have been proposed: the actin "A-triad" and the myosin "mesa/IHD" models.	4
The Splicing Efficiency of Activating HRAS Mutations Can Determine Costello Syndrome Phenotype and Frequency in Cancer. || Child Codon Costello Syndrome Exons Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Neoplasms Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) RNA Splice Sites RNA Splicing || Costello syndrome (CS) may be caused by activating mutations in codon 12/13 of the HRAS proto-oncogene. HRAS p.Gly12Val mutations have the highest transforming activity, are very frequent in cancers, but very rare in CS, where they are reported to cause a severe, early lethal, phenotype. We identified an unusual, new germline p.Gly12Val mutation, c.35_36GC>TG, in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of his HRAS cDNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild type and mutant HRAS minigenes, we confirmed that c.35_36GC>TG results in exon 2 skipping by simultaneously disrupting the function of a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and creation of an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS). We show that this vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 is caused by a weak 3' splice site, which makes exon 2 inclusion dependent on binding of splicing stimulatory proteins, like SRSF2, to the critical ESE. Because the majority of cancer- and CS- causing mutations are located here, they affect splicing differently. Therefore, our results also demonstrate that the phenotype in CS and somatic cancers is not only determined by the different transforming potentials of mutant HRAS proteins, but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion resulting from the different HRAS mutations. Finally, we show that a splice switching oligonucleotide (SSO) that blocks access to the critical ESE causes exon 2 skipping and halts proliferation of cancer cells. This unravels a potential for development of new anti-cancer therapies based on SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping.	0
Mutant p53 is a transcriptional co-factor that binds to G-rich regulatory regions of active genes and generates transcriptional plasticity. || Binding Sites Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Immunoprecipitation GPI-Linked Proteins Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Guanosine Humans Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The molecular mechanisms underlying mutant p53 (mutp53) "gain-of-function" (GOF) are still insufficiently understood, but there is evidence that mutp53 is a transcriptional regulator that is recruited by specialized transcription factors. Here we analyzed the binding sites of mutp53 and the epigenetic status of mutp53-regulated genes that had been identified by global expression profiling upon depletion of endogenous mutp53 (R273H) expression in U251 glioblastoma cells. We found that mutp53 preferentially and autonomously binds to G/C-rich DNA around transcription start sites (TSS) of many genes characterized by active chromatin marks (H3K4me3) and frequently associated with transcription-competent RNA polymerase II. Mutp53-bound regions overlap predominantly with CpG islands and are enriched in G4-motifs that are prone to form G-quadruplex structures. In line, mutp53 binds and stabilizes a well-characterized G-quadruplex structure in vitro. Hence, we assume that binding of mutp53 to G/C-rich DNA regions associated with a large set of cancer-relevant genes is an initial step in their regulation by mutp53. Using GAS1 and HTR2A as model genes, we show that mutp53 affects several parameters of active transcription. Finally, we discuss a dual mode model of mutp53 GOF, which includes both stochastic and deterministic components.	0
Recurring HRAS mutation G12S in Dutch patients with Costello syndrome. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adult Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis European Continental Ancestry Group Female Humans Male Mutation, Missense Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Syndrome || Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome characterized by coarse face, loose skin and cardiomyopathy. It is often associated with benign and malignant tumors. Several groups have now demonstrated that CS is caused by recurring mutations in the HRAS gene in different ethnic groups. Here, we describe three unrelated Dutch patients and show that they all have the same mutation, G12S, in HRAS. To our knowledge, our patients are the first Dutch to be analysed. The syndrome seems to be genetically homogeneous. We discuss the pertinent nosology of the syndrome.	4
DDX3 promotes tumor invasion in colorectal cancer via the CK1ε/Dvl2 axis. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Colorectal Neoplasms DEAD-box RNA Helicases Disease Models, Animal Dishevelled Proteins Female Male Neoplasm Invasiveness Prognosis Protein Stability Proteolysis Signal Transduction TCF Transcription Factors beta Catenin || DDX3, a subunit of CK1ε, phosphorylates Dvl2 to promote β-catenin activation. Overexpression of the Dvl2 protein results in potent activation of β-catenin/TCF signaling in colorectal cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that DDX3 might promote tumor invasion via the CK1ε/Dvl2 axis due to β-catenin/TCF activation. Western blotting showed that β-catenin expression was decreased by DDX3 knockdown and increased by DDX3 overexpression in colorectal cancer cells. The TCF promoter activity and invasion capability were concomitantly increased and decreased by DDX3 manipulation in these cells. The invasion capability in colon cancer cells and xenograft lung tumor nodules induced by a DDX3-overexpressing T84 stable clone in tail-vein injection model were nearly suppressed by inhibitors of CK1ε (PF4800567) and β-catenin/TCF signaling (XAV939). Among colorectal cancer patients, DDX3 expression was positively correlated with the expression of pDvl2 and nuclear β-catenin in tumor tissues. The expression of pDvl2 occurred more frequently in high-nuclear than in low-nuclear β-catenin tumors. A prognostic significance of DDX3, pDvl2, and nuclear β-catenin on overall survival and relapse free survival was observed in this study population. We therefore suggest CK1ε or β-catenin/TCF signaling as potential targets for improving tumor regression and outcomes in colorectal cancer, particularly tumors with high-DDX3/high-nuclear β-catenin or high-DDX3/high-pDvl2/high-nuclear β-catenin expression.	0
Mutant p53 mediates survival of breast cancer cells. || Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival DNA-Binding Proteins Female Humans Mutation, Missense Nuclear Proteins Trans-Activators Transcription Factors Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || p53 is the most commonly mutated tumour-suppressor gene in human cancers. Unlike other tumour-suppressor genes, most p53 cancer mutations are missense mutations within the core domain, leading to the expression of a full-length mutant p53 protein. Accumulating evidence has indicated that p53 cancer mutants not only lose tumour suppression activity but also gain new oncogenic activities to promote tumourigenesis. The endogenous mutant p53 function in human breast cancer cells was studied using RNA interference (RNAi). Gene knockdown was confirmed by quantitative PCR and western blotting. Apoptosis was evaluated by morphological changes of cells, their PARP cleavage and annexin V staining. We show that cancer-associated p53 missense mutants are required for the survival of breast cancer cells. Inhibition of endogenous mutant p53 by RNAi led to massive apoptosis in two mutant p53-expressing cell lines, T47D and MDA-MB-468, but not in the wild-type p53-expressing cells, MCF-7 and MCF-10A. Reconstitution of an RNAi-insensitive mutant p53 in MDA-MB-468 cells completely abolished the apoptotic effects after silencing of endogenous mutant p53, suggesting the specific survival effects of mutant p53. The apoptotic effect induced by mutant p53 ablation, however, is independent of p63 or p73 function. These findings provide clear evidence of a pro-survival 'gain-of-function' property of a subset of p53 cancer mutants in breast cancer cells.	0
Relation between genotype and phenotype in Swedish phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia patients. || Base Sequence Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Gene Expression Genotype Haplotypes Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Sweden || Phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) are caused mostly by an inherited (autosomal recessive) deficiency in hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity. More than 50 PAH mutations have ben reported. The goal of the present study was to examine the molecular basis for the clinical heterogeneity of Swedish PKU and HPA patients. Mutations were identified through allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization or DNA sequencing on 128 of the 176 mutant alleles (73%). Three mutations (R408W, Y414C and IVS12) together accounted for 56% of all mutant alleles and ten relatively infrequent mutations were found on another 17% of all mutant alleles. Patients from 50 of the 88 families (57%) had identified mutations in both PAH genes and allowed use to compare the clinical effects of different combinations of PAH mutations. The in vitro activity of all of these mutations, including the newly identified G272X and delta L364, have been tested in a eukaryotic expression system. There was a strong relationship between the average in vitro PAH activity of the two mutant enzymes and both the phenylalanine tolerance and the neonatal pretreatment serum phenylalanine concentration. This confirms previous observations in Danish and German PKU patients that disease phenotype is a consequence of the nature of the mutations at the PAH locus and not significantly influenced by other loci. The sample population in the previous study did not, however, include mild HPA patients, and the observed correlation is thus restricted to severe and moderate mutant alleles. Since a comparatively high proportion of the Swedish patients were mildly affected, we have provided additional evidence that this correlation is valid throughout a continuous spectrum of clinical varieties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1 3
Lidocaine attenuation testing: An in vivo investigation of putative LQT3-associated variants in the SCN5A-encoded sodium channel. || Adolescent Cardiac Conduction System Disease DNA Mutational Analysis Electrocardiography Female Genotype Heart Rate Humans Lidocaine Long QT Syndrome Male Mutation NAV1.5 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Retrospective Studies Treatment Outcome Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Blockers Young Adult || Long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) accounts for 5%-10% of long QT syndrome and results from gain-of-function mutations in the SCN5A-encoded sodium channel. Approximately 2% of healthy individuals host rare SCN5A variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Distinction of true LQT3-causative mutations from background genetic noise is essential. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of the lidocaine attenuation test (LAT) in evaluating patients with possible LQT3. We reviewed the LAT results and medical records for 25 patients with a possible LQT3-associated SCN5A variant. The LAT involved a loading dose of 1 mg/kg of intravenous lidocaine followed by continuous infusion at 50 μg/(kg⋅min) for 20 minutes. If the corrected QT interval shortened by ≥30 ms, the LAT was defined as positive. Sixteen patients (64%) had a positive LAT, 6 of which demonstrated the E1784K variant. A positive LAT correlated in 86% of cases with abnormal in vitro channel function (mean corrected QT interval attenuation 43 ± 3 ms vs 25 ± 5 ms for wild-type variants; P = .03). Four of 5 patients (80%) with a VUS had a positive LAT (T1304M [2 patients], L1786P, and R800L). The T1304M variant demonstrated abnormal in vitro function and a positive LAT, opening the door for a potential variant promotion from VUS to likely pathogenic. The LAT may help distinguish true LQT3-causative mutations from an otherwise noncontributory VUS. Given that lidocaine acts as a late sodium current blocker, a positive LAT may enable the early identification of a pathological accentuation of the late sodium current that could be targeted therapeutically.	4
Rapid detection of phenylketonuria mutations by non-radioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. ||  || A non-radioactive single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method was used to detect various phenylketonuria (PKU) mutations in Japanese and Chinese patients. Arginine413-to-proline (R413P) mutation in exon 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene was identified in a Japanese patient by this method. The segregation of the R413P mutation in the proband's family was clearly demonstrated and the carrier status of each family member was determined. Analysis of DNA fragments containing exon 7 originated from Chinese patients revealed two mutations, arginine243-to-glutamine (R243Q) and arginine261-to-glutamine (R261Q), and a polymorphism, valine245-to-valine (V245V). Although R261Q has been identified previously among Caucasian subjects, this report is the first to describe this mutation among Orientals. Since the non-radioactive SSCP method employs pre-cast acrylamide gels and pre-made gel buffer strips combined with semi-automated temperature-controlled electrophoresis, it can be performed without much expertise in molecular biological techniques. The ability of this method to detect various mutations as demonstrated in this study and its ease of use make it feasible to detect PKU mutations in a routine DNA diagnostic laboratory.	3
Spectrum of GJB2 mutations in a cohort of nonsyndromic hearing loss cases from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. || Amino Acid Substitution Base Sequence Codon, Nonsense Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins Consanguinity DNA DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Mutation, Missense Saudi Arabia Sequence Deletion || Nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) affects a substantial proportion of newborns in the world every year. This proportion increases proportionally with the degree of consanguineous marriages in any society. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, consanguineous marriages are common practice and this is associated with a noticeably high frequency of inherited conditions affecting the resulting progeny, including NSHL. Until now there is no published data on the genetic causes of NSHL in Saudi Arabia, which greatly hindered the ability of local genetic counseling and family planning centers to distinguish between hereditary and nonhereditary forms of NSHL and subsequently could not give information on the possible inheritance of deafness. In addition, the lack of validated genetic tests for NSHL delayed the detection of deafness in affected individuals and may have lowered the efficiency of later medical interventions. Further, the population covered in this study is likely to have a multiethnic background caused by decades of religious and economic migration to this region. To address such problems, we undertook the task of unraveling the genetic causes of hearing loss in Saudi Arabia, starting with identifying the GJB2/DFNB1 mutation spectrum in a cohort of unrelated individuals suffering from mild to profound NSHL. A total of 12 reported GJB2 mutations were identified in 17 out of 109 (15.59%) NSHL cases. Biallelic GJB2 mutations were identified in 11 out of the 109 NSHL cases (10.09%), with c.35delG being the most common (7/11, 63.63%). The remaining six patients were found to have monoallelic GJB2 mutations. Interestingly, biallelic GJB2 mutations were not detected in patients of Arab tribal origins, reflecting the genetic heterogeneity of the western area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, ethnically targeted genetic screening for GJB2 mutations could be a useful tool toward the management of NSHL in this area.	4
MDM2 and CDK4 amplifications are rare events in salivary duct carcinomas. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 Female Gene Amplification Genes, p53 Humans Immunohistochemistry Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Salivary Gland Neoplasms || Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is an aggressive adenocarcinoma of the salivary glands associated with poor clinical outcome. SDCs are known to carry TP53 mutations in about 50%, however, only little is known about alternative pathogenic mechanisms within the p53 regulatory network. Particularly, data on alterations of the oncogenes MDM2 and CDK4 located in the chromosomal region 12q13-15 are limited in SDC, while genomic rearrangements of the adjacent HMGA2 gene locus are well documented in subsets of SDCs. We here analyzed the mutational status of the TP53 gene, genomic amplification of MDM2, CDK4 and HMGA2 rearrangement/amplification as well as protein expression of TP53 (p53), MDM2 and CDK4 in 51 de novo and ex pleomorphic adenoma SDCs.25 of 51 cases were found to carry TP53 mutations, associated with extreme positive immunohistochemical p53 staining levels in 13 cases. Three out of 51 tumors had an MDM2 amplification, one of them coinciding with a CDK4 amplification and two with a HMGA2 rearrangement/amplification. Two of the MDM2 amplifications occurred in the setting of a TP53 mutation. Two out of 51 cases showed a CDK4 amplification, one synchronously being MDM2 amplified and the other one displaying concurrent low copy number increases of both, MDM2 and HMGA2.In summary, we here show that subgroups of SDCs display genomic amplifications of MDM2 and/or CDK4, partly in association with TP53 mutations and rearrangement/amplification of HMGA2. Further research is necessary to clarify the role of chromosomal region 12q13-15 alterations in SDC tumorigenesis and their potential prognostic and therapeutic relevance.	4
The controversial p.Arg127His mutation in GJB2: report on three Portuguese hearing loss family cases. || Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Base Sequence Connexin 26 Connexins Consanguinity DNA Primers Female Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation, Missense Pedigree Portugal || Mutations in the GJB2 gene account for up to 50% of hereditary nonsyndromic hearing loss in several populations. Over 200 mutations are already described in this gene, and three of them, c.35delG, c.167delT, and c.235delC, are the most frequent in Caucasians, Ashkenazi Jews, and Asians, respectively. Most of GJB2 hearing loss-related mutations are recessive, but a few dominant alleles have also been described. Apart from the clearly pathogenic mutations, there are some other variants whose pathogenicity is still controversial, such as p.Met34Thr, p.Val37Ile, p.Arg127His, and p.Val153Ile. The p.Arg127His allele has been found in some mono- and biallelic hearing-impaired patients from several countries. In this article we report on some Portuguese patients harboring this mutation. Taking into consideration the analysis of these Portuguese cases as well as the genetic and functional data regarding p.Arg127His available in the literature, we conclude that this variant may be a cause of hearing loss depending on environmental factors and/or genetic background.	4
Mutations in GJB2, GJB6, and mitochondrial DNA are rare in African American and Caribbean Hispanic individuals with hearing impairment. || African Americans Caribbean Region Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Gene Frequency Hearing Loss Hispanic Americans Humans Mutation || Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing impairment (ARNSHI) comprises 80% of familial hearing loss cases. Approximately half result from mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene, GJB2, in Caucasian populations. Heterozygous mutations in GJB2 occasionally co-occur with a deletion of part of GJB6 (connexin 30; Cx30). It is estimated that approximately 1% of deafness is maternally inherited, due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Few studies have focused on the frequency of mutations in connexins or mtDNA in African American (AA) and Caribbean Hispanic (CH) admixture populations. In this study, we performed bidirectional sequencing of the GJB2 gene and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for the common GJB6 deletion, as well as PCR/RFLP analysis for three mutations in mtDNA (A1555G, A3243G, A7445G), in 109 predominantly simplex AA and CH individuals. Variations found were a 101T > C (M34T; 1/101 cases), 109G > A (V37I; 1/101), 35delG (mutation; 4/101, (3/4) of non-AA/CH ethnicity), 167delT (mutation; 1/101), 139G > T (mutation; E47X; 1/101 homozygote, consanguineous), -15C > T (1/101), 79G > A (V27I; 9/101), 380G > A (R127H; 4/101; Guyana, India, Pakistan ethnicity), 670A > C (Indeterminate; K224Q; 1/101), 503A > G (novel; K168R; 3/101) and 684C > A (novel; 1/101). All but one of the AA and CH patients had monoallelic variations. There were no hemizygous GJB6 deletions in those with monoallelic GJB2 variations. We also did not identify any patients with the three mutations in mtDNA. Bidirectional sequencing of the GJB2 gene was performed in 187 AA and Hispanic healthy individuals. Our results reveal that GJB2 mutations, GJB6 deletions, and mtDNA mutations may not be significant in these minority admixture populations.	4
Folding of tetrameric p53: oligomerization and tumorigenic mutations induce misfolding and loss of function. || Amino Acid Substitution Base Sequence DNA Humans In Vitro Techniques Models, Molecular Neoplasms Point Mutation Protein Denaturation Protein Folding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Multimerization Protein Stability Protein Structure, Quaternary Recombinant Proteins Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The physiologically active form of p53 consists of a tetramer of four identical 393-amino-acid subunits associated via their tetramerization domains (TDs; residues 325-355). One in two human tumors contains a point mutation in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 (residues 94-312). Most existing studies on the effects of these mutations on p53 structure and function have been carried out on the isolated DBD fragment, which is monomeric. Recent structural evidence, however, suggests that DBDs may interact with each other in full-length tetrameric forms of p53. Here, we investigate the effects of tumorigenic DBD mutations on the folding of p53 in its tetrameric form. We employ the construct consisting of DBD and TD (amino acids 94-360). We characterize the stability and conformational state of the tumorigenic DBD mutants R248Q, R249S, and R282Q using equilibrium denaturation and functional assays. Destabilizing mutations cause DBD to misfold when it is part of the p53 tetramer, but not when it is monomeric. This conformation is populated under moderately destabilizing conditions (10 degrees C in 2 M urea, and at physiological temperature in the absence of denaturant). Under those same conditions, it is not present in the isolated DBD fragment or in the presence of the TD mutation L344P, which abolishes tetramerization. Misfolding appears to involve intramolecular DBD-DBD association within a single tetrameric molecule. This association is promoted by destabilization of DBD (caused by mutation or elevated temperature) and by the high local DBD concentration enforced by tetramerization of TD. Disrupting the nonnative DBD-DBD interaction or transiently inhibiting tetramerization and allowing p53 to fold as a monomer may be potential strategies for pharmacological intervention in cancer.	0
Low-burden TP53 mutations in chronic phase of myeloproliferative neoplasms: association with age, hydroxyurea administration, disease type and JAK2 mutational status. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Disease Progression Female Gene Frequency High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Hydroxyurea Janus Kinase 2 Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Male Middle Aged Mutation Myeloproliferative Disorders Retrospective Studies Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || The multistep process of TP53 mutation expansion during myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been documented retrospectively. It is currently unknown how common TP53 mutations with low variant allele frequency (VAF) are, whether they are linked to hydroxyurea (HU) cytoreduction, and what disease progression risk they carry. Using ultra-deep next-generation sequencing, we examined 254 MPN patients treated with HU, interferon alpha-2a or anagrelide and 85 untreated patients. We found TP53 mutations in 50 cases (0.2-16.3% VAF), regardless of disease subtype, driver gene status and cytoreduction. Both therapy and TP53 mutations were strongly associated with older age. Over-time analysis showed that the mutations may be undetectable at diagnosis and slowly increase during disease course. Although three patients with TP53 mutations progressed to TP53-mutated or TP53-wild-type AML, we did not observe a significant age-independent impact on overall survival during the follow-up. Further, we showed that complete p53 inactivation alone led to neither blast transformation nor HU resistance. Altogether, we revealed patient's age as the strongest factor affecting low-burden TP53 mutation incidence in MPN and found no significant age-independent association between TP53 mutations and hydroxyurea. Mutations may persist at low levels for years without an immediate risk of progression.	4
Investigation of Pathogenic Genes in Chinese sporadic Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Patients by Whole Exome Sequencing. || Adult Aged Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic China Databases, Genetic Exome Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans INDEL Mutation Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Interaction Maps Sarcomeres Sequence Analysis, DNA || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiovascular disease with high heterogeneity. Limited knowledge concerning the genetic background of nearly 40% HCM cases indicates there is a clear need for further investigation to explore the genetic pathogenesis of the disease. In this study, we undertook a whole exome sequencing (WES) approach to identify novel candidate genes and mutations associated with HCM. The cohort consisted of 74 unrelated patients with sporadic HCM (sHCM) previously determined to be negative for mutations in eight sarcomere genes. The results showed that 7 of 74 patients (9.5%) had damaging mutations in 43 known HCM disease genes. Furthermore, after analysis combining the Transmission and De novo Association (TADA) program and the ToppGene program, 10 putative genes gained priority. A thorough review of public databases and related literature revealed that there is strong supporting evidence for most of the genes playing roles in various aspects of heart development. Findings from recent studies suggest that the putative and known disease genes converge on three functional pathways: sarcomere function, calcium signaling and metabolism pathway. This study illustrates the benefit of WES, in combination with rare variant analysis tools, in providing valuable insight into the genetic etiology of a heterogeneous sporadic disease.	4
Mutant TP53 modulates metastasis of triple negative breast cancer through adenosine A2b receptor signaling. ||  || The identification of genes with synthetic lethality in the context of mutant TP53 is a promising strategy for the treatment of basal-like triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study investigated regulators of mutant TP53 (R248Q) in basal-like TNBC and their impact on tumorigenesis. TNBC cells were analyzed by RNA-seq, and synthetic-lethal shRNA knock-down screening, to identify genes related to the expression of mutant TP53. A tissue microarray of 232 breast cancer samples, that included 66 TNBC cases, was used to assess clinicopathological correlates of tumor protein expression. Functional assays were performedin vitro andin vivo to assess the role of ADORA2B in TNBC. Transcriptome profiling identified ADORA2B as up-regulated in basal-like TNBC cell lines with R248Q-mutated TP53, with shRNA-screening suggesting the potential for a synthetic-lethal interaction between these genes. In clinical samples, ADORA2B was highly expressed in 39.4% (26/66) of TNBC patients. ADORA2B-expression was significantly correlated with ER (P < 0.01), PgR (P = 0.027), EGFR (P < 0.01), and tumor size (P = 0.037), and was an independent prognostic factor for outcome (P = 0.036). In line with this, ADORA2B-transduced TNBC cells showed increased tumorigenesis, and ADORA2B knockdown, along with mutant p53 knockdown, decreased metastasis bothin vitro andin vivo. Notably, the cytotoxic cyclic peptide SA-I suppressed ADORA2B expression and tumorigenesis in TNBC cell lines. ADORA2B expression increases the oncogenic potential of basal-like TNBC and is an independent factor for poor outcome. These data suggest that ADORA2B could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for basal-like TNBC.	0
Roscovitine-induced apoptosis of H1299 cells depends on functional status of p53. ||  || Roscovitine, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, is promising anticancer agent. Its antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects can be mediated by the p53 signaling pathway. To define the role of p53 in roscovitine-induced cell response, we prepared H1299/p53 cell lines inducibly expressing specific variants of p53 (p53wt and hotspot R175H, temperature-dependent P98A, A159V, S215G, Y220C, Y234C mutants). In the presence of roscovitine, each cell line variant behaved in specific way reflecting activity of the p53 protein. Roscovitine decreased production of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and induced apoptosis. This effect was the most efficient in cells expressing p53wt protein with full activity. The cell expressing partially and conditionally active p53 mutants responded to roscovitine less efficiently. The cells expressing p53 mutants A159V and Y234C were very sensitive to roscovitine but their response was clearly temperature-dependent. The cells expressing P98A, S215G and Y220C p53 mutants exhibited only weak sensitivity to roscovitine and underwent apoptosis in low frequency. In principle, each td p53 mutant responded to roscovitine in distinct way. We showed clearly that the impact of roscovitine on H1299 cells depends on functional status of p53 they produce. This suggests that patients with tumors exhibiting specific p53 variants can benefit from the roscovitine therapy.	0
APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations in early-onset Alzheimer disease: A genetic screening study of familial and sporadic cases. || Adult Age of Onset Alzheimer Disease Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor Female France Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Presenilin-1 Presenilin-2 || Amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) mutations cause autosomal dominant forms of early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD-EOAD). Although these genes were identified in the 1990s, variant classification remains a challenge, highlighting the need to colligate mutations from large series. We report here a novel update (2012-2016) of the genetic screening of the large AD-EOAD series ascertained across 28 French hospitals from 1993 onwards, bringing the total number of families with identified mutations to n = 170. Families were included when at least two first-degree relatives suffered from early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) with an age of onset (AOO) ≤65 y in two generations. Furthermore, we also screened 129 sporadic cases of Alzheimer disease with an AOO below age 51 (44% males, mean AOO = 45 ± 2 y). APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 mutations were identified in 53 novel AD-EOAD families. Of the 129 sporadic cases screened, 17 carried a PSEN1 mutation and 1 carried an APP duplication (13%). Parental DNA was available for 10 sporadic mutation carriers, allowing us to show that the mutation had occurred de novo in each case. Thirteen mutations (12 in PSEN1 and 1 in PSEN2) identified either in familial or in sporadic cases were previously unreported. Of the 53 mutation carriers with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, 46 (87%) had all three CSF biomarkers-total tau protein (Tau), phospho-tau protein (P-Tau), and amyloid β (Aβ)42-in abnormal ranges. No mutation carrier had the three biomarkers in normal ranges. One limitation of this study is the absence of functional assessment of the possibly and probably pathogenic variants, which should help their classification. Our findings suggest that a nonnegligible fraction of PSEN1 mutations occurs de novo, which is of high importance for genetic counseling, as PSEN1 mutational screening is currently performed in familial cases only. Among the 90 distinct mutations found in the whole sample of families and isolated cases, definite pathogenicity is currently established for only 77%, emphasizing the need to pursue the effort to classify variants.	4
TP53 Mutational Status and Prediction of Benefit from Adjuvant 5-Fluorouracil in Stage III Colon Cancer Patients. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Colonic Neoplasms Disease-Free Survival Female Fluorouracil Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Prospective Studies Survival Rate Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We investigated the hypothesis that the varying treatment efficacy of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5FU) in stage III colon cancer is linked to the TP53 mutational status. ABCSG-90 was a prospective randomized trial in which effect of adjuvant 5FU was studied in stage III colon cancer patients. Tumor material of 70% of these patients (389/572) was available for analysis of the biomarker TP53 using a TP53-gene-specific Sanger sequencing protocol. Median follow-up was 88 months. TP53 mutation frequency was 33%. A significant interaction between TP53 status, outcomes and nodal category was found (P = 0.0095). In the N1 category, TP53 wildtype patients had significantly better overall survival than TP53 mutated (81.0% vs. 62.0% overall survival at 5 years; HR = 2.131; 95% CI: 1.344-3.378; P = 0.0010). In the N2 category, the TP53 status did not affect survival (P = 0.4992). In TP53 wildtype patients, the prognostic significance of N category was significantly enhanced (P = 0.0002). In TP53 mutated patients, survival curves of N1 and N2 patients overlapped and nodal category was no longer prognostic. The biomarker TP53 independently predicted effect of adjuvant 5FU in N1 colon cancer patients. TP53 was not predictive in N2 patients, in whom 5FU is known to have no effect.	4

Fourteen cases were genotyped. The onset age of progressive impairment reported by the mutation carriers was between age 35 and 45 years. Pure-tone thresholds deteriorated by about 2-7 dB per year (mean 3.8 dB per year) in a variable, often asymmetrical, fashion. One mutation carrier developed recurrent episodes of vertigo accompanied by nausea and vomiting, resembling Ménière's disease. Two others developed special susceptibility for motion sickness and appeared to have a hyperactive vestibulo-ocular reflex. More advanced stages of vestibular impairment, i.e. vestibular hyporeflexia and complete vestibular areflexia, were eventually found in a number of cases. DFNA9/COCH should be considered as a possible cause in patients developing combined progressive cochlear and vestibular impairment, or suspected hereditary Ménière-like disease, from around middle age.	4
Genetic and functional analysis of a Li Fraumeni syndrome family in China. || Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Sequence Child Child, Preschool China DNA Copy Number Variations Family Female Genetic Association Studies Genotype Germ-Line Mutation Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Male Mutation Pedigree Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Young Adult || Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare familial cancer predisposition syndrome with autosomal-dominant inheritance, occurring as frequently as one in 5,000-20,000 individuals. However, no LFS case has been reported from mainland China although it constitutes one quarter of population on earth. In this study, we identified, to our best knowledge, the first Li Fraumeni syndrome family in China. Six family members were affected with various tumors. A TP53 mutation (c.730G > A; p.G244S) co-segregated with the tumor phenotype within this family. Functional analysis indicated that G244S mutation disrupted the transactivity, DNA-binding and cell growth inhibition activity of p53 protein. Two available tumor samples (medulloblastoma and choroid plexus papilloma) underwent large rearrangement in the chromosomes and loss of wild-type TP53. Our data warranted further studies on the prevalence of germline TP53 mutation in various tumor patients in China.	4
Increased expression of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K in pancreatic cancer and its association with the mutant p53. || Blotting, Western Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K Humans Immunohistochemistry Immunoprecipitation Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutant Proteins Mutation Neoplastic Stem Cells Pancreatic Neoplasms Protein Binding RNA Interference Signal Transduction Tissue Array Analysis Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 ras Proteins || The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K is an essential RNA and DNA binding protein involved in gene expression and signal transduction including DNA transcription, RNA splicing, RNA stability and translation. The role of hnRNP K in cancer is relatively understudied. However, several cellular functions strongly indicate that hnRNP K is involved in tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated the altered protein expression and the subcellular distribution of the hnRNP K protein using tissue microarrays in pancreatic cancer. We showed an increased cytoplasmic hnRNP K in pancreatic cancer. This increase in hnRNP K protein occurs at the posttranscriptional level. We postulate that the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K will lead to silenced mRNA translation of tumor suppressor genes and thus contributes to pancreatic cancer development. We also demonstrated that knocking down of hnRNP K expression by siRNA inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth and colony formation. hnRNP K was identified as a member of the p53/HDM2 pathway. Whether hnRNP K interacts with the mutant p53 is not known. Using two different pancreatic cancer cell lines, we can demonstrate that hnRNP K interacts with the mutant p53. The subcellular distribution and function of the mutant p53 and the interaction of hnRNP K/mutant p53 were affected by the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway, growth factors and the specific p53 mutations in pancreatic cancer cells. Since Kras is activated and p53 is mutated in most pancreatic cancers, these data unveiled an important new signaling pathway that linked by hnRNP K and mutant p53 in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis.	0
Ocular findings in Noonan syndrome: a retrospective cohort study of 105 patients. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Eye Diseases Female Genetic Markers Genotype Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Middle Aged Mutation Noonan Syndrome Retrospective Studies Young Adult || The aim of this retrospective study is to describe ocular findings in a large Noonan syndrome cohort and to detect associations between ocular features and genetic mutations that were not found in earlier studies. We collected ophthalmological and genetic data of 105 patients (median age, 12 years; range, 0-60 years) clinically diagnosed as Noonan syndrome. The ocular findings were linked to the genotypes. All patients with Noonan syndrome showed multiple abnormalities in the categories of vision and refraction, external ocular features, ocular alignment and motility, anterior ocular segment, and posterior ocular segment. In total, 50 patients have NS due to a mutation in PTPN11. Permanent visual impairment (bilateral best-corrected visual acuity < 0.3) was found in 7 patients, including patients with a mutation in RAF1, SHOC2, and KRAS. Keratoconus was found in 2 PTPN11 positive patients, and prominent corneal nerves were observed in a patient with a SOS1 mutation. This study shows an overview of ocular abnormalities in Noonan syndrome, including permanent visual impairment caused by binocular optic nerve abnormalities and nystagmus. Delay in ophthalmological diagnosis is still present, also in patients with visual impairment. All Noonan syndrome patients should have a complete ophthalmological examination at the time of diagnosis. What is Known: • Although we discover more pathogenic mutations in patients with Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome still is a clinical diagnosis • Ocular features of Noonan syndrome are characterized by developmental anomalies of the eyelids and associated with other ocular abnormalities in childhood (including refractive errors, strabismus and amblyopia). What is New: • There seems to be a delay in the ophthalmological diagnosis and awareness of the broad variety ofophthalmological features including refractive errors and visual impairment in Noonan syndrome is needed. All children should have a full ophthalmological examination at the time of diagnosis. • Permanent visual impairment (best-corrected visual acuity < 0.3) is found in patients with mutations in RAF1, SHOC2, and KRAS and the cause is probably a developmental disorder of the optic nerves.	4
Molecular chaperones in the acquisition of cancer cell chemoresistance with mutated TP53 and MDM2 up-regulation. ||  || Utilizing the TCGA PANCAN12 dataset we discovered that cancer patients with mutations in TP53 tumor suppressor and overexpression ofMDM2 oncogene exhibited decreased survival post treatment. Interestingly, in the case of breast cancer patients, this phenomenon correlated with high expression level of several molecular chaperones belonging to the HSPA, DNAJB and HSPC families. To verify the hypothesis that such a genetic background may promote chaperone-mediated chemoresistance, we employed breast and lung cancer cell lines that constitutively overexpressed heat shock proteins and have shown that HSPA1A/HSP70 and DNAJB1/HSP40 facilitated the binding of mutated p53 to the TAp73α protein. This chaperone-mediated mutated p53-TAp73α complex induced chemoresistance to DNA damaging reagents, like Cisplatin, Doxorubicin, Etoposide or Camptothecin. Importantly, when theMDM2 oncogene was overexpressed, heat shock proteins were displaced and a stable multiprotein complex comprising of mutated p53-TAp73α-MDM2 was formed, additionally amplifying cancer cells chemoresistance. Our findings demonstrate that molecular chaperones aid cancer cells in surviving the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutics and may have therapeutic implications.	0
The genetics of Ménière's disease. ||  || Our understanding of the genetic basis of Ménière's disease (MD) is still limited. Although the familial clustering and the geographical and racial differences in incidence strongly suggest a certain role for genetic factors in the development of MD, no convincing evidence for an association with any gene exists, at present. In this review, starting from rational bases for a genetic approach to MD, we explored the numerous reports published in literature and summarize the recent advances in understanding of the genetic fundaments of the disease.	4
Where genotype is not predictive of phenotype: towards an understanding of the molecular basis of reduced penetrance in human inherited disease. || Alleles DNA Copy Number Variations Epigenesis, Genetic Gene Frequency Genes, Modifier Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetics, Population Genome, Human Genotype Humans Mutation, Missense Penetrance Phenotype || Some individuals with a particular disease-causing mutation or genotype fail to express most if not all features of the disease in question, a phenomenon that is known as 'reduced (or incomplete) penetrance'. Reduced penetrance is not uncommon; indeed, there are many known examples of 'disease-causing mutations' that fail to cause disease in at least a proportion of the individuals who carry them. Reduced penetrance may therefore explain not only why genetic diseases are occasionally transmitted through unaffected parents, but also why healthy individuals can harbour quite large numbers of potentially disadvantageous variants in their genomes without suffering any obvious ill effects. Reduced penetrance can be a function of the specific mutation(s) involved or of allele dosage. It may also result from differential allelic expression, copy number variation or the modulating influence of additional genetic variants in cis or in trans. The penetrance of some pathogenic genotypes is known to be age- and/or sex-dependent. Variable penetrance may also reflect the action of unlinked modifier genes, epigenetic changes or environmental factors. At least in some cases, complete penetrance appears to require the presence of one or more genetic variants at other loci. In this review, we summarize the evidence for reduced penetrance being a widespread phenomenon in human genetics and explore some of the molecular mechanisms that may help to explain this enigmatic characteristic of human inherited disease.	4
A child with an FGFR3 mutation, a laterality disorder and an hepatoblastoma: novel associations and possible gene-environment interactions. || Abnormalities, Multiple Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses Female Hepatoblastoma Humans Liver Neoplasms Mutation Phenotype Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 || We report on a 3-year-old girl, from a 3-generation family with an FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation, who in addition to craniosynostosis, had a laterality disorder and hepatoblastoma, following a pregnancy complicated by maternal insulin-dependent diabetes. The clinical features possibly result from the combined effects of the maternal diabetes and the familial FGFR3 mutation, thus representing a unique gene-environment interaction that may have implications for the understanding of the phenotypes described in this child.	4
Using genetics and genomics strategies to personalize therapy for cancer: focus on melanoma. || Genome, Human Humans Melanoma Mutation Nucleic Acid Hybridization Precision Medicine || Individualizing therapeutic selection for patients is a major goal in cancer treatment today. This goal is best facilitated by understanding both an individual's inherited genetic variation and the somatic genetic changes arising during cancer development. Clinical decision making based on inherited genetic variation is done for those patients with cancer susceptibility syndromes and more generally to personalize drug dosing. Personalized medicine based on genetic and genomic changes within tumors is being applied more widely, with increased use of therapies targeted to somatic mutations and amplifications. Somatic mutations associated with resistance also are being used to select against therapies. Somatic point mutation testing being used clinically includes direct sequencing, short sequencing and single nucleotide interrogation. Single amplifications are commonly assessed using FISH or CISH; high throughput assessment of amplifications and deletions is done mainly on a research basis. Melanomas contain complex mutational profiles that allow them to be sub-grouped by their genetic and genomic profile, each of which then can be evaluated pre-clinically to determine their response to targeted therapies. BRAF V600E mutations are the most common found in melanoma; specific inhibitors of mutant BRAF have been developed and are currently in clinical trials. In addition, other melanoma sub-groups have been identified genetically, which respond to other inhibitors. These studies focus on somatic genetic changes in cancer, which can be targeted directly by therapies. However in the future, personalized medicine will use a combination of inherited and somatic genetics to select the optimal tailored therapy for each patient.	4
MUG-Mel2, a novel highly pigmented and well characterized NRAS mutated human melanoma cell line. || Cell Culture Techniques Cell Line, Tumor Cells, Cultured GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Skin Neoplasms Skin Pigmentation || NRAS mutation in melanoma has been associated with aggressive tumor biology and poor prognosis. Although targeted therapy has been tested for NRAS mutated melanoma, response rates still appear much weaker, than in BRAF mutated melanoma. While plenty of cell lines exist, however, only few melanogenic cell lines retain their in vivo characteristics. In this work we present an intensively pigmented and well-characterized cell line derived from a highly aggressive NRAS mutated cutaneous melanoma, named MUG-Mel2. We present the clinical course, unique morphology, angiogenic properties, growth characteristics using in vivo experiments and 3D cell culture, and results of the exome gene sequencing of an intensively pigmented melanogenic cell line MUG-Mel2, derived from a cutaneous metastasis of an aggressive NRAS p. Q61R mutated melanoma. Amongst several genetic alterations, mutations in GRIN2A, CREBP, PIK3C2G, ATM, and ATR were present. These mutations, known to reinforce DNA repair problems in melanoma, might serve as potential treatment targets. The aggressive and fast growing behavior in animal models and the obtained phenotype in 3D culture reveal a perfect model for research in the field of NRAS mutated melanoma.	0
Spectrum and frequency of GJB2, GJB6 and SLC26A4 gene mutations among nonsyndromic hearing loss patients in eastern part of India. || Base Sequence Case-Control Studies Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans India Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Prevalence Sulfate Transporters || Genetically caused nonsyndromic hearing loss is highly heterogeneous. Inspite of this large heterogeneity, mutations in the genes GJB2, GJB6 and SLC26A4 are major contributors. The mutation spectrum of these genes varies among different ethnic groups. Only a handful of studies focused on the altered genetic signature of these genes in different demographic regions of India but never focused on the eastern part of the country. Our study for the first time aimed to characterize the mutation profile of these genes in hearing loss patients of West Bengal state, India. Mutations in GJB2, GJB6 and SLC26A4 genes were screened by bidirectional sequencing from 215 congenital nonsyndromic hearing loss patients. Radiological diagnosis was performed in patients with SLC26A4 mutations by temporal bone CT scan. The study revealed that 4.65% and 6.97% patients had monoallelic and biallelic GJB2 mutations respectively. Six mutations were identified, p.W24X being the most frequent one accounting for 71.05% of the mutated alleles. Mutations in GJB6 including the previously identified deletion mutation (GJB6-D13S1830) were not identified in our study. Further, no patients harbored biallelic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene or the common inner ear malformation Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct (EVA). The mutation profile of GJB2 in our study is distinct from other parts of India, suggesting that the mutation spectrum of this gene varies with ethnicity and geographical origin. The absence of GJB6 mutations and low frequency of SLC26A4 mutations suggest that additional genetic factors may also contribute to this disease.	1
Clinical sequencing using a next-generation sequencing-based multiplex gene assay in patients with advanced solid tumors. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child DNA Mutational Analysis Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms Precision Medicine Young Adult || Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled physicians to test for genomic alterations in multiple cancer-related genes at once in daily clinical practice. In April 2015, we introduced clinical sequencing using an NGS-based multiplex gene assay (OncoPrime) certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment. This assay covers the entire coding regions of 215 genes and the rearrangement of 17 frequently rearranged genes with clinical relevance in human cancers. The principal indications for the assay were cancers of unknown primary site, rare tumors, and any solid tumors that were refractory to standard chemotherapy. A total of 85 patients underwent testing with multiplex gene assay between April 2015 and July 2016. The most common solid tumor types tested were pancreatic (n = 19; 22.4%), followed by biliary tract (n = 14; 16.5%), and tumors of unknown primary site (n = 13; 15.3%). Samples from 80 patients (94.1%) were successfully sequenced. The median turnaround time was 40 days (range, 18-70 days). Potentially actionable mutations were identified in 69 of 80 patients (86.3%) and were most commonly found in TP53 (46.3%), KRAS (23.8%), APC (18.8%), STK11 (7.5%), and ATR (7.5%). Nine patients (13.0%) received a subsequent therapy based on the NGS assay results. Implementation of clinical sequencing using an NGS-based multiplex gene assay was feasible in the clinical setting and identified potentially actionable mutations in more than 80% of patients. Current challenges are to incorporate this genomic information into better therapeutic decision making.	4
Dissection of the sequence-specific DNA binding and exonuclease  activities reveals a superactive yet apoptotically impaired mutant p53  protein. || Apoptosis Base Sequence Cell Cycle Cell Line DNA Enzyme Activation Exonucleases Humans Mutation Protein Binding Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Both sequence-specific DNA binding and exonuclease activities have been mapped to the central conserved core domain of p53. To gain more information about these two activities a series of mutants were generated that changed core domain histidine residues. Of these mutants, only one, H115N p53, showed markedly reduced exonuclease activity (ca. 15% of wild-type). Surprisingly, purified H115N p53 protein was found to be significantly more potent than wild-type p53 in binding to DNA by several criteria including gel mobility shift assay, filter binding and DNase I footprinting. Interestingly as well, non-specific DNA binding by the core domain of H115N p53 is superior to that of wild-type p53. To study H115N p53 in vivo, clones of H1299 cells expressing tetracycline regulated wild-type or H115N p53 were generated. H115N was both more potent than wild-type p53 in inducing p53 target genes such as p21 and PIG3 and was also more effective in arresting cells in G1. Unexpectedly, in contrast to wild-type p53, H115N p53 was markedly impaired in causing apoptosis when cells were subjected to DNA damage. Our results indicate that the exonuclease activity and transcriptional activation functions of p53 can be separated. They also extend previous findings showing that cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are separable functions of p53. Finally, these experiments confirm that DNA binding and xonuclease activities are distinct features of the p53 core domain.	0
ALX4 gain-of-function mutations in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. || Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence Conserved Sequence Craniosynostoses DNA-Binding Proteins Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Humans Mutation, Missense Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Analysis, DNA Transcription Factors || Craniosynostosis is the early fusion of one or more sutures of the infant skull and is a common defect occurring in approximately 1 of every 2,500 live births. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) accounts for approximately 80% of all cases and is thought to have strong genetic determinants that are yet to be identified. ALX4 is a homeodomain transcription factor with known involvement in osteoblast regulation. By direct sequencing of the ALX4 coding region in sagittal or sagittal-suture-involved nonsyndromic craniosynostosis probands, we identified novel, nonsynonymous, familial variants in three of 203 individuals with NSC. Using dual-luciferase assay we show that two of these variants (V7F and K211E) confer a significant gain-of-function effect on ALX4. Our results suggest that ALX4 variants may have an impact on the genetic etiology of NSC.	4
Frequency of EGFR T790M mutation and multimutational profiles of rebiopsy samples from non-small cell lung cancer developing acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Japanese patients. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Antineoplastic Agents Biopsy Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Codon DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Female Genotype Humans Japan Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors || The majority of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation eventually develop resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Minimal information exists regarding genetic alterations in rebiopsy samples from Asian NSCLC patients who develop acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations who had undergone rebiopsies after developing acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We analyzed 27 practicable samples using a tumor genotyping panel to assess 23 hot-spot sites of genetic alterations in nine genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN, and HER2), gene copy number of EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1, and FGFR2, and ALK, ROS1, and RET fusions. Additionally, 34 samples were analyzed by commercially available EGFR mutation tests. Sixty-one patients underwent rebiopsy. Twenty-seven samples were analyzed using our tumor genotyping panel, and 34 samples were analyzed for EGFR mutations only by commercial clinical laboratories. Twenty-one patients (34 %) had EGFR T790M mutation. Using our tumor genotyping panel, MET gene copy number gain was observed in two of 27 (7 %) samples. Twenty patients received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs even after disease progression, and 11 of these patients had T790M mutation in rebiopsy samples. In contrast, only 10 of 41 patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression had T790M mutation. The frequency of T790M mutation in patients who received continuous treatment with EGFR-TKIs after disease progression was significantly higher than that in patients who finished EGFR-TKI treatment at disease progression (55 % versus 24 %, p = 0.018). The frequency of T790M mutation in this study was lower than that in previous reports examining western patients. These results suggest that continuous treatment with EGFR-TKI after disease progression may enhance the frequency of EGFR T790M mutation in rebiopsy samples.	4
The Features of Colorectal Tumors in a Patient with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. || Adenocarcinoma Adenoma Adult Colonoscopy Colorectal Neoplasms Diagnosis, Differential Female Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome || A young woman with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) was referred to our hospital. On examination, multiple flat neoplasms were detected in addition to semi-pedunculated polyps. Restorative proctocolectomy was performed; one submucosal invasive cancer, two mucosal cancers, and several adenomas with high-grade dysplasia were detected. On immunohistochemical staining with p53, every part of all neoplasms, even the small adenomas, showed strong positive staining. Multiple flat neoplasms may be characteristic of patients with LFS and may have a much higher risk of rapid progression to invasive carcinomas than sporadic neoplasms. Thus, careful and frequent colonoscopy surveillance may be needed for patients with LFS.	4
MDM2 turnover and expression of ATRX determine the choice between quiescence and senescence in response to CDK4 inhibition. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cellular Senescence Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 DNA Helicases Gene Knockdown Techniques Humans Liposarcoma Nuclear Proteins Phosphorylation Piperazines Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Pyridines Retinoblastoma Protein X-linked Nuclear Protein || CDK4 inhibitors (CDK4i) earned Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA last year and are entering phase III clinical trials in several cancers. However, not all tumors respond favorably to these drugs. CDK4 activity is critical for progression through G1 phase and into the mitotic cell cycle. Inhibiting this kinase induces Rb-positive cells to exit the cell cycle into either a quiescent or senescent state. In this report, using well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS) cell lines, we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i-induced senescence. Failure to reduce MDM2 does not prevent CDK4i-induced withdrawal from the cell cycle but the cells remain in a reversible quiescent state. Reducing MDM2 in these cells drives them into the more stable senescent state. CDK4i-induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer, lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53. MDM2 turnover depends on its E3 ligase activity and expression of ATRX. Interestingly, in seven patients the changes in MDM2 expression were correlated with outcome. These insights identify MDM2 and ATRX as new regulators controlling geroconversion, the process by which quiescent cells become senescent, and this insight may be exploited to improve the activity of CDK4i in cancer therapy.	0
Multiple rare variants in high-risk pancreatic cancer-related genes may increase risk for pancreatic cancer in a subset of patients with and without germline CDKN2A mutations. || Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18 Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Melanoma Neoplasm Proteins Pancreatic Neoplasms Pedigree Risk Factors Signal Transduction Skin Neoplasms || The risk of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increased in melanoma-prone families but the causal relationship between germline CDKN2A mutations and PC risk is uncertain, suggesting the existence of non-CDKN2A factors. One genetic possibility involves patients having mutations in multiple high-risk PC-related genes; however, no systematic examination has yet been conducted. We used next-generation sequencing data to examine 24 putative PC-related genes in 43 PC patients with and 23 PC patients without germline CDKN2A mutations and 1001 controls. For each gene and the four pathways in which they occurred, we tested whether PC patients (overall or CDKN2A+ and CDKN2A- cases separately) had an increased number of rare nonsynonymous variants. Overall, we identified 35 missense variants in PC patients, 14 in CDKN2A+ and 21 in CDKN2A- PC cases. We found nominally significant associations for mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) in all PC patients and for ATM, CPA1, and PMS2 in CDKN2A- PC patients. Further, nine CDKN2A+ and four CDKN2A- PC patients had rare potentially deleterious variants in multiple PC-related genes. Loss-of-function variants were only observed in CDKN2A- PC patients, with ATM having the most pathogenic variants. Also, ATM variants (n = 5) were only observed in CDKN2A- PC patients with a family history that included digestive system tumors. Our results suggest that a subset of PC patients may have increased risk because of germline mutations in multiple PC-related genes.	4
Mutant p53 regulates ovarian cancer transformed phenotypes through autocrine matrix deposition. ||  || High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa) harbors p53 mutations and can originate from the epithelial cell compartment of the fallopian tube fimbriae. From this site, neoplastic cells detach, survive in the peritoneal cavity, and form cellular clusters that intercalate into the mesothelium to form ovarian and peritoneal masses. To examine the contribution of mutant p53 to phenotypic alterations associated with HGS-OvCA, we developed live-cell microscopy assays that recapitulate these early events in cultured fallopian tube nonciliated epithelial (FNE) cells. Expression of stabilizing mutant variants of p53, but not depletion of endogenous wild-type p53, in FNE cells promoted survival and cell-cell aggregation under conditions of cell detachment, leading to the formation of cell clusters with mesothelium-intercalation capacity. Mutant p53R175H-induced phenotypes were dependent on fibronectin production, α5β1 fibronectin receptor engagement, andTWIST1 expression. These results indicate that FNE cells expressing stabilizing p53 mutants acquire anchorage independence and subsequent mesothelial intercalation capacity through a mechanism involving mesenchymal transition and matrix production. These findings provide important new insights into activities of mutant p53 in the cells of origin of HGS-OvCa.	0
Lethal presentation of neurofibromatosis and Noonan syndrome. ||  || Neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome are both common genetic disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Similarities between neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome have been noted for over 20 years and patients who share symptoms of both conditions are often given the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). The molecular basis of these combined phenotypes was poorly understood and controversially discussed over several decades until the discovery that the syndromes are related through disturbances of the Ras pathway. We present an infant male with coarse facial features, severe supravalvar pulmonic stenosis, automated atrial tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, airway compression, severe neurological involvement, and multiple complications that lead to death during early infancy. The severity of clinical presentation and significant dysmorphic features suggested the possibility of a double genetic disorder in the Ras pathway instead of NFNS. Molecular analysis showed a missense mutation in exon 25 of the NF1 gene (4288A>G, p.N1430D) and a pathogenic mutation on exon 8 (922A>G, p.N308D) of the PTPN11 gene. Cardiovascular disease has been well described in patients with Noonan syndrome with PTPN11 mutations but the role of haploinsufficiency for neurofibromin in the heart development and function is not yet well understood. Our case suggests that a double genetic defect resulting in the hypersignaling of the Ras pathway may lead to complex cardiovascular abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, refractory arrhythmia, severe neurological phenotype, and early death.	4
Hypothyroidism in late-onset Pompe disease. ||  || In Pompe disease, a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase enzyme activity leads to pathologic accumulation of glycogen in tissues. Phenotype heterogeneity in Pompe includes an infantile form and late-onset forms (juvenile- and adult-onset forms). Symptoms common to all phenotypes include progressive muscle weakness and worsening respiratory function. Patients with late-onset forms of Pompe disease commonly complain of chronic fatigue and generalized muscle weakness prior to being diagnosed with Pompe disease, and this may lead to consideration of hypothyroidism in the differential diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the adult-onset form of Pompe disease. Electronic chart review was performed at the Advanced Therapies Clinic at the University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC) to identify patients with late-onset Pompe disease. The identified charts were reviewed for a co-diagnosis of hypothyroidism. A query was made to the clinical data repository at UMMC searching diagnosis ICD9 code 244.9 (hypothyroidism not otherwise specified) and/or presence of levothyroxine from 2011 to 2014 in patients 18 years of age and older. The clinical data repository found a prevalence of hypothyroidism of 3.15% (56,072 of 1,782,720 patients) in the adult patient population at UMMC. Ten adult patients with Pompe disease were identified, five with the diagnosis of hypothyroidism (50%, 95% CI: 23.7, 76.3, p < 0.001 compared with the general UMMC adult population). Hypothyroidism was found at a higher prevalence in patients with late-onset Pompe disease compared to the general adult population at UMMC. Studies in larger populations of patients with Pompe disease would be needed to confirm an association of Pompe disease and hypothyroidism. Challenges include finding an adequate sample size, due the rarity of Pompe disease.	1
Wild-type H- and N-Ras promote mutant K-Ras-driven tumorigenesis by modulating the DNA damage response. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Cell Survival Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Checkpoint Kinase 1 DNA Damage Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Female Flow Cytometry GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Membrane Proteins Mice Mice, Nude Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Mutation Neoplasms Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Phosphorylation Protein Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa ras Proteins || Mutations in KRAS are prevalent in human cancers and universally predictive of resistance to anticancer therapeutics. Although it is widely accepted that acquisition of an activating mutation endows RAS genes with functional autonomy, recent studies suggest that the wild-type forms of Ras may contribute to mutant Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Here, we show that downregulation of wild-type H-Ras or N-Ras in mutant K-Ras cancer cells leads to hyperactivation of the Erk/p90RSK and PI3K/Akt pathways and, consequently, the phosphorylation of Chk1 at an inhibitory site, Ser 280. The resulting inhibition of ATR/Chk1 signaling abrogates the activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint and confers specific sensitization of mutant K-Ras cancer cells to DNA damage chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo.	0
Identification of Mutations in Cell-Free Circulating Tumor DNA in Adrenocortical Carcinoma: A Case Series. || Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms Adrenocortical Carcinoma Aged DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genes, p53 High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Neoplastic Cells, Circulating Pilot Projects Telomerase beta Catenin || The disease course of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) patients is heterogeneous. A marker for prognosis and treatment response would facilitate choices for diagnosis and therapy. In other cancer types, circulating cell-free tumor DNA predicted tumor dynamics. The present pilot study included six patients. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed mutations in three ACC cases. From these patients, blood was drawn before (1 to 2 weeks) and after surgery and cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) was isolated. Tumor-specific mutations were found in the cfDNA of one of the three patients, with metastasized ACC at diagnosis. NGS of the tumor showed an NRAS mutation (c.182A>G:p.Q61R) in 78%, a TP53 mutation (c.856G>A:p.E286K) in 60%, and a TERT gene mutation (1295250C>T) in 28% of the reads. The preoperative cfDNA showed the same mutations at a frequency of 64%, 32%, and 2%, respectively. The postoperative cfDNA showed the same mutations but at lower frequencies (52%, 16%, and 3%, respectively). The patient was postoperatively treated with mitotane and chemotherapy. No mutations were detected in the corresponding leukocyte DNA or in the cfDNA from the two other patients. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time mutations occurring at high levels in cfDNA collected before and after surgery from one of three patients, after previous identification in the tumor. However, in the cfDNA from two patients with known mutations, we were unable to reliably detect mutations in the cfDNA. Our results indicate that mutation detection in cfDNA can vary among ACC patients, and other approaches might be required to detect the tumor response and monitor progressive disease.	4
Gypsy phenylketonuria: a point mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in Gypsy families from Slovakia. ||  || A direct mutational analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH) in Gypsy families with phenylketonuria (PKU) has not yet been presented. However, they obviously represent a group at high risk for this inherited disease. We analyzed the PAH loci of 65 Gypsies originating from Eastern Slovakia by a combination of PCR amplification, direct sequencing and ASO hybridization. These studies uncovered 10 "classical PKU" patients to be homozygous for a R252W (CGG-TGG) transition, and 29 heterozygous carriers of this mutation. Fifteen control Caucasoid PKU patients from the Czech and Slovak Republics were selected. In this group we detected R252W mutation in two subjects (6.67% of all mutant alleles). Both were compound heterozygous for two different mutations. Previous haplotype studies of Welsh Gypsies with PKU were uninformative in the determination of heterozygosity. ASO hybridization served us effectively for the consequent analyses in Gypsy PKU-related families and to identify the carriers among the unrelated subjects.	1 3
SHOC2 subcellular shuttling requires the KEKE motif-rich region and N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain and impacts on ERK signalling. || Amino Acid Motifs Animals COS Cells Cell Line Cell Nucleus Cercopithecus aethiops Cytoplasm HEK293 Cells Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Loose Anagen Hair Syndrome MAP Kinase Signaling System Mice NIH 3T3 Cells Noonan Syndrome Protein Transport || SHOC2 is a scaffold protein composed almost entirely by leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and having an N-terminal region enriched in alternating lysine and glutamate/aspartate residues (KEKE motifs). SHOC2 acts as a positive modulator of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling cascade by favouring stable RAF1 interaction with RAS. We previously reported that the p.Ser2Gly substitution in SHOC2 underlies Mazzanti syndrome, a RASopathy clinically overlapping Noonan syndrome, promoting N-myristoylation and constitutive targeting of the mutant to the plasma membrane. We also documented transient nuclear translocation of wild-type SHOC2 upon EGF stimulation, suggesting a more complex function in signal transduction.Here, we characterized the domains controlling SHOC2 shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and those contributing to SHOC2S2G mistargeting to the plasma membrane, analysed the structural organization of SHOC2's LRR motifs, and determined the impact of SHOC2 mislocalization on ERK signalling. We show that LRRs 1 to 13 constitute a structurally recognizable domain required for SHOC2 import into the nucleus and constitutive targeting of SHOC2S2G to the plasma membrane, while the KEKE motif-rich region is necessary to achieve efficient SHOC2 export from the nucleus. We also document that SHOC2S2G localizes both in raft and non-raft domains, and that it translocates to the non-raft domains following stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that SHOC2 trapping at different subcellular sites has a diverse impact on ERK signalling strength and dynamics, suggesting a dual counteracting modulatory role of SHOC2 in the control of ERK signalling exerted at different intracellular compartments.	0
Role of AXL in invasion and drug resistance of colon and breast cancer cells and its association with p53 alterations. || Animals Breast Neoplasms Camptothecin Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Colonic Neoplasms Doxorubicin Fluorouracil Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Silencing HCT116 Cells HeLa Cells Humans Irinotecan MCF-7 Cells Mice, Knockout Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Proto-Oncogene Proteins RNA, Small Interfering Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Signal Transduction Treatment Outcome Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || To characterize AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) expression in relationship to tumor protein P53 (TP53 gene, p53 protein) and its role in tumor invasion and response to therapy. We used 14 cell lines, including 3 isogenic pairs carrying mutant/knockout p53, to gain insight into the relationship between AXL and TP53. These included HCT116, HCT116.p53 mutant, RKO, and RKO.p53-/- lines (all from colon cancers) as well as breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and 1001 (MCF7-p53 mutant clone). HeLa cell line was used as a positive control for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). AXL expression was determined by Western blotting using rabbit monoclonal antibody clone C89E7. AXL siRNA silencing was performed and followed by collagen invasion assay. Cell viability analysis using the sulforhodamine B assay and the invasion assay were performed after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin for breast cancer cells; 5FU or irinotecan for colon cancer cells). We showed that the introduction of p53 mutations or knockout increased expression levels of AXL in isogenic cells compared to the matching p53 wild-type parental cells. Overall, we found a trend for correlation between the potential EMT candidate AXL, p53 alterations, and EMT markers in colorectal and breast cancers. The expression of AXL in RKO cells, a rare colon cancer cell line with inactive Wnt signaling, suggests that the AXL oncogene might provide an alternative genetic pathway for colorectal carcinogenesis in the absence of Wnt signaling activation and TP53 mutation. AXL silencing in theTP53 mutant isogenic cell lines 1001, HCT116.p53 mutant and RKO.P53-/- was > 95% efficient and the silenced cells were less invasive compared to the parentalTP53 wild-type cells. AXL silencing showed a subtle trend to restore colon cancer cell sensitivity to 5FU or irinotecan. Importantly, AXL expressing cells developed more invasive potential after exposure to chemotherapy compared to the AXL-silenced cells. AXL is influenced by p53 status and could cause the emergence of aggressive clones after exposure to chemotherapy. These findings could have applications in cancer management.	0
Nutrigenetic variants and cardio-metabolic risk in women with or without gestational diabetes. || Adult Diabetes, Gestational Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Nutrigenomics Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Pregnancy Risk Factors || Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most frequent metabolic disorder in pregnancy and it can be considered a silent risk associated to T2DM and CVD later in life. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of clinical parameters with nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved with nutrients and metabolism in women with or without GDM in order to identify potential routine clinical markers for early prevention. Nine gene variants associated with nutrients and metabolism, namely PPARG2 rs1801282 (C > G); PPARGC1A rs8192678 (C > T); TCF7L2 rs7903146 (C > T); LDLR rs2228671 (C > T); MTHFR rs1801133 (C > T); APOA5 rs662799 (T > C); GCKR rs1260326 (C > T); FTO rs9939609 (T > A); MC4R rs17782313 (T > C) were genotyped in 104 GDM cases and 124 controls using High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis. The genetic variant rs7903146 (C > T) in TCF7L2 gene showed a strong association with GDM risk (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: [1.24-5.29]). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between lipid parameters and polymorphisms in other genes, namely PPARG2 [p = 0,03], APOA5 [p = 0,02], MC4R [p = 0,03], LDLR [p = 0,04] and FTO [p = 0,03]. In addition, rs17782313 variant, mapped close to MC4R gene, was associated to BMI in pre-pregnancy [p = 0,02] and at the end of pregnancy [p = 0,03] in GDM group. In our study, we found significant associations between routine clinical parameters and some gene variants connected with nutrients and metabolism in women with GDM. These results can provide useful information to develop effective tools and possible personalized intervention strategies in a timely manner.	4
Coverage and diagnostic yield of Whole Exome Sequencing for the Evaluation of Cases with Dilated and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. ||  || Targeted next generation sequencing of gene panels has become a popular tool for the genetic diagnosis of hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, it is uncertain whether the use of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) represents a more effective approach for diagnosis of cases with HCM and DCM. In this study, we performed indirect comparisons of the coverage and diagnostic yield of WES on genes and variants related to HCM and DCM versus 4 different commercial gene panels using 40 HCM and DCM patients, assuming perfect coverage in those panels. We identified 6 pathogenic or likely pathogenic among 14 HCM patients (diagnostic yield 43%). 3 pathogenic or likely pathogenic were found among the 26 DCM patients (diagnostic yield 12%). The coverage was similar to that of four existing commercial gene panels due to the clustering of mutation within MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNT2, and TTN. Moreover, the coverage of WES appeared inadequate for TNNI3 and PLN. We conclude that most of the pathogenic variants for HCM and DCM can be found within a small number of genes which were covered by all the commercial gene panels, and the application of WES did not increase diagnostic yield.	4
[Genes of connexin proteins participating in sound perception]. ||  || Congenital deafness is a severe, incurable and hardly correctable inherited disease. Mutations in GCB2 and GJB6 genes are most prevalent causes of deafness and occur in patients with hereditary and sporadic deafness all over the world. Some ethnic groups exhibit high rate of heterozygous carriage of most frequent GJB2 mutations (35delG, 167delT, 235delC). Definite association of hereditary deafness and mutational alterations in genes of connexins 26, 30 and 31 shows high informative value of molecular-genetic methods which diagnose hereditary deafness, carriage of mutations in GJB2, GJB3 and GJB6 genes, provide definite probability of the disease in medico-genetic consulting. Further progress in genetics of hereditary hearing loss will raise efficacy of deafness diagnosis at early stages of fetal development and prevent birth of babies with congenital defects of sound perception.	4
Sensitization of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-resistant malignant melanomas by quercetin. || Antioxidants Apoptosis Cell Culture Techniques Cell Line, Tumor Humans Melanoma Quercetin Skin Neoplasms TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand || Malignant melanoma is the most commonly diagnosed skin cancer associated with a high rate of metastasis. Low-stage melanoma is easily treated, but metastatic malignant melanoma is an extremely treatment-resistant malignancy with low survival rates. The application of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rhTRAIL) for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma holds considerable promise because of its selective proapoptotic activity towards cancer cells and not nontransformed cells. Unfortunately, the clinical utilization of rhTRAIL has been terminated due to the resistance of many cancer cells to undergo apoptosis in response to rhTRAIL. However, rhTRAIL-resistance can be abrogated through the cotreatment with compounds derived from 'Mother Nature' such as quercetin that can modulate cellular components responsible for rhTRAIL-resistance. Here, we show that rhTRAIL-resistant malignant melanomas are sensitized by quercetin. Quercetin action is manifested by the upregulation of rhTRAIL-binding receptors DR4 and DR5 on the surface of cancer cells and by increased rate of the proteasome-mediated degradation of the antiapoptotic protein FLIP. Our data provide for a new efficient and nontoxic treatment of malignant melanoma.	0
mCSM-NA: predicting the effects of mutations on protein-nucleic acids interactions. ||  || Over the past two decades, several computational methods have been proposed to predict how missense mutations can affect protein structure and function, either by altering protein stability or interactions with its partners, shedding light into potential molecular mechanisms giving rise to different phenotypes. Effectively and efficiently predicting consequences of mutations on protein-nucleic acid interactions, however, remained until recently a great and unmet challenge. Here we report an updated webserver for mCSM-NA, the only scalable method we are aware of capable of quantitatively predicting the effects of mutations in protein coding regions on nucleic acid binding affinities. We have significantly enhanced the original method by including a pharmacophore modelling and information of nucleic acid properties into our graph-based signatures, considering the reverse mutation and by using a refined, more reliable data set, based on a new release of the ProNIT database, which has significantly improved the reliability and applicability of the methodology. Our new predictive model was capable of achieving a correlation coefficient of up to 0.70 on cross-validation and 0.68 on blind-tests, outperforming its previous version. The server is freely available via a user-friendly web interface at: http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/mcsm_na.	0
Ubiquitin-Mediated Degradation of Aurora Kinases. ||  || The Aurora kinases are essential regulators of mitosis in eukaryotes. In somatic cell divisions of higher eukaryotes, the paralogs Aurora kinase A (AurA) and Aurora kinase B (AurB) play non-overlapping roles that depend on their distinct spatiotemporal activities. These mitotic roles of Aurora kinases depend on their interactions with different partners that direct them to different mitotic destinations and different substrates: AurB is a component of the chromosome passenger complex that orchestrates the tasks of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, while AurA has many known binding partners and mitotic roles, including a well-characterized interaction with TPX2 that mediates its role in mitotic spindle assembly. Beyond the spatial control conferred by different binding partners, Aurora kinases are subject to temporal control of their activation and inactivation. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is a critical route to irreversible inactivation of these kinases, which must occur for ordered transition from mitosis back to interphase. Both AurA and AurB undergo targeted proteolysis after anaphase onset as substrates of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase, even while they continue to regulate steps during mitotic exit. Temporal control of Aurora kinase destruction ensures that AurB remains active at the midbody during cytokinesis long after AurA activity has been largely eliminated from the cell. Differential destruction of Aurora kinases is achieved despite the fact that they are targeted at the same time and by the same ubiquitin ligase, making these substrates an interesting case study for investigating molecular determinants of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in higher eukaryotes. The prevalence of Aurora overexpression in cancers and their potential as therapeutic targets add importance to the task of understanding the molecular determinants of Aurora kinase stability. Here, we review what is known about ubiquitin-mediated targeting of these critical mitotic regulators and discuss the different factors that contribute to proteolytic control of Aurora kinase activity in the cell.	0
The common C49620T polymorphism in the sulfonylurea receptor gene SUR1 (ABCC8) in patients with gestational diabetes and subsequent glucose metabolism abnormalities. || ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters Adult Anthropometry Blood Glucose Diabetes, Gestational Female Glucose Glucose Tolerance Test Humans Insulin Insulin Resistance Insulin-Secreting Cells Polymorphism, Genetic Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying Pregnancy Receptors, Drug Sulfonylurea Receptors || The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the common C49620T polymorphism in the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) gene and glucose metabolism, β-cell secretory function and insulin resistance in women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM). Study group included 199 women, diagnosed GDM within the last 5-12 years and control group of comparable 50 women in whom GDM was excluded during pregnancy. Blood glucose and insulin levels were measured during oral glucose tolerance test. Indices of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA %B) were calculated. In all patients, the C49620T polymorphism in intron 15 of the SUR1 gene was determined. The distribution of the studied polymorphism in the two groups did not differ from each other (χ(2) = 0.34, P = 0.8425). No association between the distribution of polymorphisms and coexisting glucose metabolism disorders (χ(2) = 7,13, P = 0, 3043) was found. No association was also observed between the polymorphism and HOMA %B or HOMA-IR. The polymorphism C49620T in the SUR1 gene is not associated with insulin resistance and/or insulin secretion in women with a history of GDM and does not affect the development of GDM, or the development of glucose intolerance in the studied population.	4
The Exome Clinic and the role of medical genetics expertise in the interpretation of exome sequencing results. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Exome Expert Testimony Female Genetic Counseling Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Testing Genetics, Medical Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Physicians Retrospective Studies Whole Exome Sequencing Young Adult || Evaluation of the clinician's role in the optimal interpretation of clinical exome sequencing (ES) results. Retrospective chart review of the first 155 patients who underwent clinical ES in our Exome Clinic and direct interaction with the ordering geneticist to evaluate the process of interpretation of results. The most common primary indication was neurodevelopmental problems (~66%), followed by multiple congenital anomalies (~10%). Based on sequencing data, the overall diagnostic yield was 36%. After assessment by the medical geneticist, incorporation of detailed phenotypic and molecular data, and utilization of additional diagnostic modalities, the final diagnostic yield increased to 43%. Seven patients in our cohort were included in initial case series that described novel genetic syndromes, and 23% of patients were involved in subsequent research studies directly related to their results or involved in efforts to move beyond clinical ES for diagnosis. Clinical management was directly altered due to the ES findings in 12% of definitively diagnosed cases. Our results emphasize the usefulness of ES, demonstrate the significant role of the medical geneticist in the diagnostic process of patients undergoing ES, and illustrate the benefits of postanalytical diagnostic work-up in solving the "diagnostic odyssey."

Analysis of SDHD promoter mutations in various types of melanoma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Base Sequence Binding Sites Biomarkers, Tumor Child Conjunctival Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Melanoma Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced Phenotype Prognosis Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets Skin Neoplasms Succinate Dehydrogenase Sunlight Time Factors Ultraviolet Rays Uveal Neoplasms Young Adult || Recently, recurrent mutations in regulatory DNA regions, such as promoter mutations in the TERT gene were identified in melanoma. Subsequently, Weinhold et al. reported SDHD promoter mutations occurring in 10% of melanomas and being associated with a lower overall survival rate. Our study analyzes the mutation rate and clinico-pathologic associations of SDHD promoter mutations in a large cohort of different melanoma subtypes. 451 melanoma samples (incl. 223 non-acral cutaneous, 38 acral, 33 mucosal, 43 occult, 43 conjunctival and 51 uveal melanoma) were analyzed for the presence of SDHD promoter mutations by Sanger-sequencing. Statistical analysis was performed to screen for potential correlations of SDHD promoter mutation status with various clinico-pathologic criteria. The SDHD promoter was successfully sequenced in 451 tumor samples. ETS binding site changing SDHD promoter mutations were identified in 16 (4%) samples, of which 5 mutations had not been described previously. Additionally, 5 point mutations not located in ETS binding elements were identified. Mutations in UV-exposed tumors were frequently C>T. One germline C>A SDHD promoter mutation was identified. No statistically significant associations between SDHD promoter mutation status and various clinico-pathologic variables or overall patient survival were observed. Melanomas harbor recurrent SDHD promoter mutations, which occur primarily as C>T alterations in UV-exposed melanomas. In contrast to the initial report and promoter mutations in the TERT gene, our analysis suggests that SDHD promoter mutations are a relatively rare event in melanoma (4% of tumors) of unclear clinical and prognostic relevance.	4
Identification of TMPRSS3 as a Significant Contributor to Autosomal Recessive Hearing Loss in the Chinese Population. || Adult Age of Onset Child Child, Preschool China DNA Mutational Analysis Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant, Newborn Male Membrane Proteins Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Serine Endopeptidases Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || Hereditary hearing loss is characterized by a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in the TMPRSS3 (transmembrane protease, serine 3) gene cause prelingual (DFNB10) or postlingual (DFNB8) deafness. In our previous study, three pathogenic mutations inTMPRSS3 were identified in one Chinese family. To evaluate the importance ofTMPRSS3 mutations in recessive deafness among the Chinese, we screened 150 autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) families and identified 6 that carried seven causativeTMPRSS3 mutations, including five novel mutations (c.809T>A, c.1151T>G, c.1204G>A, c.1244T>C, and c.1250G>A) and two previously reported mutations (c.323-6G>A and c.916G>A). Each of the five novel mutations was classified as severe, by both age of onset and severity of hearing loss. Together with our previous study, six families were found to share one pathogenic mutation (c.916G>A, p.Ala306Thr). To determine whether this mutation arose from a common ancestor, we analyzed six short tandem repeat (STR) markers spanning theTMPRSS3 gene. In four families, we observed linkage disequilibrium between p.Ala306Thr and STR markers. Our results indicate that mutations inTMPRSS3 account for about 4.6% (7/151) of Chinese ARNSHL cases lacking mutations inSLC26A4 orGJB2 and that the recurrentTMPRSS3 mutation p.Ala306Thr is likely to be a founder mutation.	4
Mutations in the BRCT binding site of BRCA1 result in hyper-recombination. || Amino Acid Motifs BRCA1 Protein Binding Sites Breast Neoplasms Carrier Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus DNA DNA Repair Female Genetic Vectors HEK293 Cells Humans Mutation Nuclear Proteins Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Rad51 Recombinase Recombination, Genetic Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins Ubiquitination || We introduced a K1702M mutation in the BRCA1 BRCT domain known to prevent the binding of proteins harboring pS-X-X-F motifs such as Abraxas-RAP80, BRIP1, and CtIP. Surprisingly, rather than impairing homologous recombination repair (HRR), expression of K1702M resulted in hyper-recombination coinciding with an accumulation of cells in S-G2 and no effect on nonhomologous end-joining. These cells also showed increased RAD51 and RPA nuclear staining. More pronounced effects were seen with a naturally occurring BRCT mutant (M1775R) that also produced elevated levels of ssDNA, in part co-localizing with RPA, in line with excessive DNA resection. M1775R induced unusual, thread-like promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and clustered RPA foci rather than the typical juxtaposed RPA-PML foci seen with wild-type BRCA1. Interestingly, K1702M hyper-recombination diminished with a second mutation in the BRCA1 RING domain (I26A) known to reduce BRCA1 ubiquitin-ligase activity. Thesein vitro findings correlated with elevated nuclear RAD51 and RPA staining of breast cancer tissue from a patient with the M1775R mutation. Altogether, the disruption of BRCA1 (BRCT)-pS-X-X-F protein binding results in ubiquitination-dependent hyper-recombination via excessive DNA resection and the appearance of atypical PML-NBs. Thus, certain BRCA1 mutations that cause hyper-recombination instead of reduced DSB repair might lead to breast cancer.	0
PCSK9 Loss-of-Function Variants, Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke: Data From 9 Studies of Blacks and Whites. || African Continental Ancestry Group Aged Aged, 80 and over Cholesterol, LDL Cohort Studies Coronary Disease European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genetic Variation Genotype Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Male Odds Ratio Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proportional Hazards Models Proprotein Convertase 9 Risk Factors Stroke || PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) variants allow for the examination of the effects of lifetime reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on cardiovascular events. We examined the association ofPCSK9 LOF variants with LDL-C and incident coronary heart disease and stroke through a meta-analysis of data from 8 observational cohorts and 1 randomized trial of statin therapy. These 9 studies together included 17 459 blacks with 403 (2.3%) having at least 1 Y142X or C679X variant and 31 306 whites with 955 (3.1%) having at least 1 R46L variant. Unadjusted odds ratios for associations between PCSK9 LOF variants and incident coronary heart disease (851 events in blacks and 2662 events in whites) and stroke (523 events in blacks and 1660 events in whites) were calculated using pooled Mantel-Haenszel estimates with continuity correction factors. Pooling results across studies using fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted models,PCSK9 LOF variants were associated with 35 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], 32-39) lower LDL-C in blacks and 13 mg/dL (95% CI, 11-16) lower LDL-C in whites.PCSK9 LOF variants were associated with a pooled odds ratio for coronary heart disease of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.28-0.92) in blacks and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.63-1.06) in whites.PCSK9 LOF variants were not associated with incident stroke (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.48-1.47 in blacks and odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.80-1.41 in whites). PCSK9 LOF variants were associated with lower LDL-C and coronary heart disease incidence.PCSK9 LOF variants were not associated with stroke risk.	4
Health effects associated with measured levels of contaminants in the Arctic. || Arctic Regions Environmental Exposure Environmental Monitoring Environmental Pollutants Health Status Humans Pesticides || The Human Health Assessment Group has over the past decade recommended that effect studies be conducted in the circumpolar area. Such studies examine the association between contaminant exposure in the Arctic populations and health effects. Because foetuses and young children are the most vulnerable, effect studies are often prospective child cohort studies. The emphasis in this article is on a description of the effects associated with contaminant exposure in the Arctic. The main topics addressed are neurobehavioural, immunological, reproductive, cardiovascular, endocrine and carcinogenic effect. For each topic, the association between exposure and effects is described, and some results are reported for similar studies outside the Arctic.	4
Transcriptional regulation of mitotic checkpoint gene MAD1 by p53. || Base Sequence Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Gene Expression Regulation Genes, cdc Histone Deacetylase 1 Histone Deacetylases Humans Hydroxamic Acids Molecular Sequence Data Nuclear Proteins Phosphoproteins Promoter Regions, Genetic Repressor Proteins Response Elements Transcription Factors Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 regulates a number of genes through transcriptional activation and repression. p53-dependent mitotic checkpoint has been described, but the underlying mechanism is still obscure. Here we examined the effect of p53 on the expression of a human mitotic checkpoint protein, Mitosis Arrest Deficiency 1 (MAD1), in cultured human cells. The expression of MAD1 was reduced when the cells were overexpressing exogenously introduced wild-type p53. The same reduction was also observed when the cells were treated with anticancer agents 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin or were irradiated with UV. Consistently, MAD1 promoter activity diminished in a dose-dependent manner when induced by p53, indicating that p53 repressed MAD1 at a transcriptional level. Intriguingly, several tumor hot spot mutations in p53 (V143A, R175H, R248W, and R273H) did not abolish the ability of p53 to repress MAD1 expression. By serial truncation of the MAD1 promoter, we confined the p53-responsive element to a 38-bp region that represents a novel sequence distinct from the known p53 consensus binding site. Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, relieved the p53 transrepression activity on MAD1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that p53, histone deacetylase 1, and co-repressor mSin3a associated with the MAD1 promoter in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest a regulatory mechanism for the mitotic checkpoint in which MAD1 is inhibited by p53.	0
Novel EPHB4 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Mutations and Kinomic Pathway Analysis in Lung Cancer. || Adenocarcinoma Amino Acid Sequence Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Computational Biology Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Lung Neoplasms Mesothelioma Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Annotation Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phosphorylation Protein Structure, Tertiary RNA, Small Interfering Receptor, EphB4 Sequence Alignment Signal Transduction Small Cell Lung Carcinoma || Lung cancer outcomes remain poor despite the identification of several potential therapeutic targets. The EPHB4 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has recently emerged as an oncogenic factor in many cancers, including lung cancer. Mutations of EPHB4 in lung cancers have previously been identified, though their significance remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of novel EPHB4 mutations that lead to putative structural alterations as well as increased cellular proliferation and motility. We also conducted a bioinformatic analysis of these mutations to demonstrate that they are mutually exclusive from other common RTK variants in lung cancer, that they correspond to analogous sites of other RTKs' variations in cancers, and that they are predicted to be oncogenic based on biochemical, evolutionary, and domain-function constraints. Finally, we show that EPHB4 mutations can induce broad changes in the kinome signature of lung cancer cells. Taken together, these data illuminate the role of EPHB4 in lung cancer and further identify EPHB4 as a potentially important therapeutic target.	0
PTEN deficiency and mutant p53 confer glucose-addiction to thyroid cancer cells: impact of glucose depletion on cell proliferation, cell survival, autophagy and cell migration. ||  || Proliferating cancer cells oxidize glucose through the glycolytic pathway. Since this metabolism is less profitable in terms of ATP production, cancer cells consume large quantity of glucose, and those that experience insufficient blood supply become glucose-addicted. We have analyzed the response to glucose depletion in WRO and FTC133 follicular thyroid cancer cells, which differ in the expression of two key regulators of the glucose metabolism. WRO cells, which express wild type p53 and PTEN, showed a higher rate of cell proliferation and were much less sensitive to glucose-depletion than FTC133 cells, which are PTEN null and express mutant p53. Glucose depletion slowed-down the autophagy flux in FTC133 cells, not in WRO cells. In a wound-healing assay, WRO cells were shown to migrate faster than FTC133 cells. Glucose depletion slowed down the cell migration rate, and these effects were more evident in FTC133 cells. Genetic silencing of either wild-type PTEN or p53 in WRO cells resulted in increased uptake of glucose, whereas the ectopic expression of PTEN in FTC133 cells resulted in diminished glucose uptake. In conclusion, compared to WRO, FTC133 cells were higher glucose up-taker and consumer. These data do not support the general contention that cancer cells lacking PTEN or expressing the mutant p53R273H are more aggressive and prone to better face glucose depletion. We propose that concurrent PTEN deficiency and mutant p53 leads to a glucose-addiction state that renders the cancer cell more sensitive to glucose restriction. The present observation substantiates the view that glucose-restriction may be an adjuvant strategy to combat these tumours.	0
Efficient Knock-in of a Point Mutation in Porcine Fibroblasts Using the CRISPR/Cas9-GMNN Fusion Gene. ||  || During CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing, site-specific double strand breaks are introduced and repaired either unspecific by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or sequence dependent by homology directed repair (HDR). Whereas NHEJ-based generation of gene knock-out is widely performed, the HDR-based knock-in of specific mutations remains a bottleneck. Especially in primary cell lines that are essential for the generation of cell culture and animal models of inherited human diseases, knock-in efficacy is insufficient and needs significant improvement. Here, we tested two different approaches to increase the knock-in frequency of a specific point mutation into the MYH7-gene in porcine fetal fibroblasts. We added a small molecule inhibitor of NHEJ, SCR7 (5,6-bis((E)-benzylideneamino)-2-mercaptopyrimidin-4-ol), during genome editing and screened cell cultures for the point mutation. However, this approach did not yield increased knock-in rates. In an alternative approach, we fused humanized Cas9 (hCas9) to the N-terminal peptide of the Geminin gene (GMNN). The fusion protein is degraded in NHEJ-dominated cell cycle phases, which should increase HDR-rates. Using hCas9-GMNN and point mutation-specific real time PCR screening, we found a two-fold increase in genome edited cell cultures. This increase of HDR by hCas9-GMNN provides a promising way to enrich specific knock-in in porcine fibroblast cultures for somatic cloning approaches.	0
Validation of an NGS mutation detection panel for melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Computational Biology DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Regulatory Networks High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Melanoma Middle Aged Paraffin Embedding Polymerase Chain Reaction Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Tissue Fixation Uveal Neoplasms Young Adult || Knowledge of the genotype of melanoma is important to guide patient management. Identification of mutations in BRAF and c-KIT lead directly to targeted treatment, but it is also helpful to know if there are driver oncogene mutations in NRAS, GNAQ or GNA11 as these patients may benefit from alternative strategies such as immunotherapy. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are often used to detect BRAF mutations, next generation sequencing (NGS) is able to determine all of the necessary information on several genes at once, with potential advantages in turnaround time. We describe here an Ampliseq hotspot panel for melanoma for use with the IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) which covers the mutations currently of most clinical interest. We have validated this in 151 cases of skin and uveal melanoma from our files, and correlated the data with PCR based assessment of BRAF status. There was excellent agreement, with few discrepancies, though NGS does have greater coverage and picks up some mutations that would be missed by PCR. However, these are often rare and of unknown significance for treatment. PCR methods are rapid, less time-consuming and less expensive than NGS, and could be used as triage for patients requiring more extensive diagnostic workup. The NGS panel described here is suitable for clinical use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples.	4
Late form of Pompe disease with glycogen storage in peripheral nerves axons. || Age of Onset Asymptomatic Diseases Axons Child Enzyme Replacement Therapy Female Glycogen Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Heterozygote Humans Leukocytes Lysosomes Microscopy, Electron Muscle, Skeletal Mutation, Missense Peripheral Nerves Staining and Labeling Vacuoles alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is caused by the deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), which degrades glycogen into glucose. Its manifestation is characterized by a broad and continuous spectrum of clinical severity ranging from severe infantile to relatively benign adult form. We describe a 12-year-old girl diagnosed at a presymptomatic stage of late form Pompe disease due to fortuitous detection of an elevated level of serum creatine kinase (CK) at the age of 4. Biopsies were taken from the quadriceps muscle and studied with histological and histochemical techniques, as well as in electron microscope. Sporadic muscle cells showed the accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, suggesting Pompe disease. Interestingly, we found lysosomal bound glycogen, located in the axons of intramuscular nerves. The diagnosis was confirmed by deficient GAA activity in leukocytes. Mutation analysis revealed changes IVS1-13T>G and p.C103G in the GAA gene. The patient was able to obtain enzyme replacement therapy in the early asymptomatic stage of the disease.	1
Proteasome modulator 9 SNPs are linked to hypertension in type 2 diabetes families. || Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Female Genetic Linkage Humans Hypertension Italy Male Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex || Chromosome 12q24 was recently associated with hypertension. Proteasome Modulator 9 (PSMD9) lies in the 12q24 locus and is in linkage with MODY3, type 2 diabetes (T2D), microvascular and macrovascular pathology, carpal tunnel syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia in Italian families. Our goal was to determine whether PSMD9 is linked to elevated blood pressure/hypertension in T2D families. We characterized the Italian T2D families' members for presence and/or absence of elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/80) and/or hypertension. The phenotypes were described as unknown in all cases in which the diagnosis was either unclear or the data were not available for the subject studied. We tested in the 200 Italians families for the presence of the linkage of the PSMD9 T2D risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) IVS3+nt460 A > G, IVS3+nt437 T > C and E197G A > G with elevated blood pressure/hypertension. The non-parametric linkage analysis was performed for this qualitative phenotype by using the Merlin software; the Lod score and correspondent P-value were calculated. Parametric linkage analysis was also performed. For the significant linkage score, 1000 replicates were run to calculate the empirical P-value. The PSMD9 gene SNPs studied are in linkage with elevated blood pressure/hypertension in our Italian families. We conclude that the PSMD9 gene and/or any variant in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs studied contribute to the linkage to hypertension within our family dataset. This is the first report of PSMD9 linkage to hypertension within the 12q24 locus.	4
Molecular investigation in children candidates and submitted to cochlear implantation. || Child Cochlear Implantation Connexin 26 Connexins Hearing Loss, Bilateral Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Severity of Illness Index || Recent progresses in molecular biology have been made in the diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss. The high prevalence of a connexin 26 gene mutation, and its easy identification have made the diagnosis possible. The most frequent gene mutation is called 35delG. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of 35delG mutation in children submitted to cochlear implantation who had severe and profound hearing loss previously diagnosed as idiopathic. The study was done at the Cochlear Implantation Clinic of the Otolaryngology Department and at the Laboratório Genética Humana-CBMEG, UNICAMP-SP. 32 children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss were evaluated. The detection of the 35delG mutation was made by a allele-specific PCR, using primers and polymerase chain reaction. 69% had a normal exam, 12% were homozygous for the mutation, 19% of the cases were heterozygous. The 35delG mutation in heterozygous is not a cause of hearing loss. The data confirm the high prevalence of the 35delG mutation in nonsyndromic bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss. It was also possible to diagnose the cause of hearing loss as genetic in a significant percentage of patients. That stresses the importance of the molecular investigation in those cases formerly classified as idiopathic.	4
[Characteristics of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations among patients with phenylketonuria from Linyi region of Shandong Province]. ||  || To explore the characteristics of (PAH) gene mutations among patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) from Linyi area of Shandong Province. For 51 children affected with PKU and their parents, the 13 exons and their flanking intronic sequences of the PAH gene were directly sequenced with Sanger method. PAH gene mutations were detected in all of the 102 alleles of the patients, which included 31 types of mutations. Common mutations included R243Q (17/102, 16.67%), IVS4-1G to A (9/102, 8.82%), R241C (8/102, 7.84%), R111X (8/102, 7.84%), and V399V (8/102, 7.84%). In addition, two novel mutations, D101N, 345-347del, have been detected. The 31 types of mutations included missense, nonsense, deletion, and splicing mutations, which were mainly located in exons 7 (29, 28.43%), 11 (18, 17.65%), 3 (16, 15.69%) and 12 (13, 12.75%). Mutations of the PAH gene in Linyi region mainly distributed in exons 7, 11, and 3, and the most common mutation were R243Q. Two novel mutations, D101N and 345-347del, have been detected.	3
DFNB1-associated deafness in Portuguese cochlear implant users: prevalence and impact on oral outcome. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Cochlear Implantation Cochlear Implants Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Deafness Female Humans Infant Language Development Male Mutation Portugal Prevalence Speech Intelligibility Speech Perception || Hearing loss is a condition that interferes with the development of the child at a cognitive and language level. Therefore, early diagnosis of deafness is important for (re)habilitation, namely through the use of cochlear implant (CI). The present study aimed at screening CI Portuguese individuals for the presence of mutations in the genes GJB2 and GJB6 (DFNB1 locus), and searching a possible correlation between the genotype and the oral habilitation outcome following implantation. Our sample included 117 CI individuals implanted longer than 5 years. Sequencing of GJB2 entire coding region was first performed. The presence of deletions del(GJB6-D13S1830) and del(GJB6-D13S1854) was subsequently tested by multiplex PCR. To assess the oral outcome of these individuals, a global score is calculated through a formula that integrates the results of a battery of speech and audiological tests routinely used in ORL services. This global oral performance score was used to test whether individuals with DFNB1-associated deafness perform significantly better than individuals without DFNB1-associated deafness. In 35% of the cases, deafness was clearly associated to DFNB1. The most common mutated allele was c.35delG (85%). Other variants have also been found, namely p.Gly130Ala, p.Asn206Ser, p.Val37Ile, p.Glu47X, p.Arg184Trp, p.Trp24X and the two common GJB6 deletions, del(GJB6-D13S1854) and del(GJB6-D13S1830), the last one identified for the first time in our population. Regarding the oral outcome, after testing the homogeneity of the two groups it could be observed that, in mean, the individuals with DFNB1-associated deafness perform significantly better (p=0.012) than the individuals without DFNB1-associated deafness. This first screening of DFNB1 genes in the Portuguese CI population provides clear evidence of the high proportion of DFNB1-associated deafness amongst the Portuguese implanted individuals. DFNB1 status is significantly associated to higher oral performance scores, with DFNB1 individuals performing, on average, 6% better than the individuals without DFNB1-associated deafness.	4
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 235delC mutation of GJB2 gene. || Asia Connexin 26 Connexins Gene Deletion Genetic Carrier Screening Hearing Loss Humans Mutation || The 235delC mutation of GJB2 gene is considered as a risk factor for the non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL), and a significant difference in the frequency and distribution of the 235delC mutation has been described world widely. A systematic review was performed by means of a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of the 235delC mutation on the risk of NSHL. A literature search in electronic databases using keywords "235delC", "GJB2" associated with "carrier frequency" was conducted to include all papers from January 1999 to June 2011. A total of 36 papers were included and there contained 13217 cases and 6521 controls derived from Oceania, American, Europe and Asian. A remarkable heterogeneity between these studies was observed. The combined results of meta-analysis showed that the 235delC mutant increased the risk of NSHL (OR = 7.9, 95%CI 4.77 ~ 13.11, P <0.00001). Meanwhile, heterogeneity of genetic effect was also observed due to the ethnic specificity and regional disparity. Therefore, the stratified meta-analysis was subsequently conducted and the results indicated that the 235delC mutation was significantly correlated with the risk of NHSL in the East Asian and South-east Asian populations (OR = 12.05, 95%CI 8.33~17.44, P <0.00001), but not significantly in the Oceania and European populations (OR = 10.36, 95%CI: 4.68~22.96, Z = 1.68, P >0.05). The 235delC mutation of GJB2 gene increased the risk of NHSL in the East Asian and South-east Asian populations, but non-significantly associated with the NSHL susceptibility in Oceania and European populations, suggesting a significant ethnic specificity of this NSHL-associated mutation.	4
TP53 drives invasion through expression of its Δ133p53β variant. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Cell Movement Colonic Neoplasms Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Protein Isoforms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53 is conventionally thought to prevent cancer formation and progression to metastasis, while mutantTP53 has transforming activities. However, in the clinic,TP53 mutation status does not accurately predict cancer progression. Here we report, based on clinical analysis corroborated with experimental data, that the p53 isoform Δ133p53β promotes cancer cell invasion, regardless ofTP53 mutation status. Δ133p53β increases risk of cancer recurrence and death in breast cancer patients. Furthermore Δ133p53β is critical to define invasiveness in a panel of breast and colon cell lines, expressing WT or mutantTP53. Endogenous mutant Δ133p53β depletion prevents invasiveness without affecting mutant full-length p53 protein expression. Mechanistically WT and mutant Δ133p53β induces EMT. Our findings provide explanations to 2 long-lasting and important clinical conundrums: how WTTP53 can promote cancer cell invasion and reciprocally why mutantTP53 gene does not systematically induce cancer progression.	0
Epithelioid rhabdomyosarcoma: a clinicopathologic and molecular study. ||  || Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma and is mostly represented by the embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS) histotypes. Whereas ERMS shows variable genetic alterations including TP53, RB1, and RAS mutations, ARMS carries a gene fusion between PAX3 or PAX7 and FOXO1. Epithelioid RMS is a morphologic variant of RMS recently described in adults. Five cases of epithelioid RMS were identified after histologic review of 85 cases of ARMS enrolled in Italian therapeutic protocols. Immunostaining analyses (muscle-specific actin, desmin, myogenin, AP-2β, EMA, cytokeratins, INI-1) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays to detect MyoD1, myogenin, and PAX3/7-FOXO1 transcripts were performed. In 4 cases DNA sequencing of TP53 was performed; and RB1 allelic imbalance and homozygous deletion were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Histologically, epithelioid RMS displayed sheets of large cells without rhabdomyoblastic differentiation or anaplasia in 3 and prominent rhabdoid cells in 2; necrosis was evident in 4, often with a geographic pattern. Immunostainings for INI, desmin, myogenin (scattered cells in 4, diffuse in 1) were positive in all; EMA and MNF116 were positive in 2; AP-2β was negative. PAX3/7-FOXO1 transcripts were absent. In all cases RB1 was wild type, and a TP53 mutation at R273H codon was found in 1. All patients are in complete remission, with a median follow-up of 6 years. Epithelioid RMS may occur in children and is probably related to ERMS, as suggested by lack of fusion transcripts, weak staining for myogenin, negative AP-2β, evidence of TP53 mutation (although only in 1 case), and a favorable clinical course.	4
Genetic basis and outcome in a nationwide study of Finnish patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ||  || Nationwide large-scale genetic and outcome studies in cohorts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have not been previously published. We sequenced 59 cardiomyopathy-associated genes in 382 unrelated Finnish patients with HCM and found 24 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in six genes in 38.2% of patients. Most mutations were located in sarcomere genes (MYBPC3, MYH7, TPM1, and MYL2). Previously reported mutations by our study group (MYBPC3-Gln1061Ter, MYH7-Arg1053Gln, and TPM1-Asp175Asn) and a fourth major mutation MYH7-Val606Met accounted for 28.0% of cases. Mutations in GLA and PRKAG2 were found in three patients. Furthermore, we found 49 variants of unknown significance in 31 genes in 20.4% of cases. During a 6.7 ± 4.2 year follow-up, annual all-cause mortality in 482 index patients and their relatives with HCM was higher than that in the matched Finnish population (1.70 vs. 0.87%; P < 0.001). Sudden cardiac deaths were rare (n = 8). Systolic heart failure (hazard ratio 17.256, 95% confidence interval 3.266-91.170, P = 0.001) and maximal left ventricular wall thickness (hazard ratio 1.223, 95% confidence interval 1.098-1.363, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of HCM-related mortality and life-threatening cardiac events. The patients with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation underwent an implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation more often than patients without a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation (12.9 vs. 3.5%, P < 0.001), but there was no difference in all-cause or HCM-related mortality between the two groups. Mortality due to HCM during 10 year follow-up among the 5.2 million population of Finland was studied from death certificates of the National Registry, showing 269 HCM-related deaths, of which 32% were sudden. We identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations in 38% of Finnish patients with HCM. Four major sarcomere mutations accounted for 28% of HCM cases, whereas HCM-related mutations in non-sarcomeric genes were rare. Mortality in patients with HCM exceeded that of the general population. Finally, among 5.2 million Finns, there were at least 27 HCM-related deaths annually.	4
Mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in Brazilian patients with phenylketonuria. ||  || In the present study, 115 Brazilian families with phenylketonuria (PKU), mainly from the Southeast of the country, were studied using three laboratory methods (DGGE, SSCP, and sequencing). All 13 exons of the PAH gene were analyzed, including the splicing sites and the promoter region. We identified 50 distinct mutations and characterized 91% of the mutant alleles. The five most prevalent mutations of the 50 mutations identified (50% of the PKU alleles) were IVS10nt-11G-->A (17.4%), followed by R261Q (12.2%), V388M (9.1%), R252W (6.5%), and R270K (4.8%). The other mutations were rare. The mutation spectrum included 10 novel mutations (IVS5nt-54A-->G, IVS6nt17G-->T, E205A, F240S, K274E, I318T, L321L, C357G, IVS11nt17G-->A, and S411X). To characterize the origin and distribution of the PAH alleles we determined the association between the detected mutations and the PCR/RFLP haplotypes and VNTR alleles located on the PAH gene. For those patients whose mutant alleles were detected, we calculated the correlation with pretreatment phenylalanine levels, thus establishing a genotype/phenotype correlation. The present results confirm the marked heterogeneity observed at the PAH locus and contribute to the understanding of the distribution and frequency of PKU mutations in the Brazilian population.	1 3
Prevalence of GJB2 mutations and the del(GJB6-D13S1830) in Argentinean non-syndromic deaf patients. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Argentina Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Models, Molecular Mutation Sequence Deletion || Genetically caused congenital deafness is a common trait affecting 1 in 2000 children and it is predominantly inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Several mutations in the GJB2 gene and a deletion of 342 kb in GJB6 (delGJB6-D13S1830) have been identified worldwide in patients with hearing impairment. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of these mutations in Argentina. Non-syndromic 46 probands (17 familial and 29 sporadic cases) were genetically evaluated. Mutations in GJB2 and/or delGJB6-D13S1830 were found in 19 patients, accounting for 41.3% of the sample. Of the 46 patients investigated in this study, 12 (26.1%) were diagnosed to carry sequence variations in both alleles; all but one, were considered causative for hearing impairment in those patients. In 7 out of 46 patients (15.2%) only one mutant allele was detected. Of their 38 chromosomes, 71% resulted with mutations in the GJB2 gene and 11% in GJB6. The most frequent mutation in GJB2 (24%) was c.35delG (11% homozygous and 13% heterozygous and compound heterozygous). In addition, 11 sequence variations different from c.35delG, were identified in the coding region of the GJB2 gene: T8M, V27I, M34T, E47X, R75W, W77R, I82M, L90P, E129K, V153I, M163V. The delGJB6-D13S1830 mutation was found in 4 patients (9%), 3 of them associated with GJB2 mutations, resulting in compound heterozygous for the DFNB1 locus. The present study demonstrates that mutations in the GJB2 gene and the delGJB6-D13S1830 are prevalent in the Argentinean population.	4
Deafness resulting from mutations in the GJB2 (connexin 26) gene in Brazilian patients. || Adolescent Adult Brazil Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Gene Frequency Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation || Congenital deafness occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 live births. In developed countries about 60% of hearing loss is genetic. However, in Brazil most cases of hearing loss are due to environmental factors, such as congenital infections (mainly rubella), perinatal anoxia, kernicterus and meningitis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the GJB2 gene is a major gene underlying congenital sensorial deafness. Mutations in this gene cause 10-20% of all genetic sensory hearing loss. One specific mutation, 35delG, accounts for the majority of mutant alleles. The extent of the hearing impairment varies from mild/moderate to profound, even within the patients homozygous for the common 35delG mutation. There may also be progression with age. Mutation analysis in the GJB2 gene was performed on 36 families (group A) presenting with at least one individual with non-syndromic deafness (NSD). An unselected series of 26 deaf individuals referred by other services where the environmental factors were not completely excluded was also part of the study (group B). Mutations in the GJB2 gene were found in 22% (eight patients) of the families tested in group A, and 11.5% (three patients) of individuals within group B. This finding should facilitate diagnosis of congenital deafness and allow early treatment of the affected subjects.	4
ROS1 rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma: prognostic impact, therapeutic options and genetic variability. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Adult Aged Female Gene Rearrangement Genetic Variation Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Prognosis Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins Survival Analysis Treatment Outcome || While recent data show that crizotinib is highly effective in patients with ROS1 rearrangement, few data is available about the prognostic impact, the predictive value for different treatments, and the genetic heterogeneity of ROS1-positive patients. 1137 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were analyzed regarding their ROS1 status. In positive cases, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed. Clinical characteristics, treatments and outcome of these patients were assessed. Overall survival (OS) was compared with genetically defined subgroups of ROS1-negative patients. 19 patients of 1035 evaluable (1.8%) had ROS1-rearrangement. The median OS has not been reached. Stage IV patients with ROS1-rearrangement had the best OS of all subgroups (36.7 months, p < 0.001). 9 of 14 (64.2%) patients had at least one response to chemotherapy. Estimated mean OS for patients receiving chemotherapy and crizotinib was 5.3 years. Ten patients with ROS1-rearrangement (52.6%) harbored additional aberrations. ROS1-rearangement is not only a predictive marker for response to crizotinib, but also seems to be the one of the best prognostic molecular markers in NSCLC reported so far. In stage IV patients, response to chemotherapy was remarkable high and overall survival was significantly better compared to other subgroups including EGFR-mutated and ALK-fusion-positive NSCLC.	4
Quantitative analysis of residual folding and DNA binding in mutant p53 core domain: definition of mutant states for rescue in cancer therapy. || Apoptosis Databases, Factual Genes, p53 Humans Models, Chemical Models, Molecular Mutation Peptide Fragments Protein Denaturation Protein Folding Recombinant Proteins Spectrometry, Fluorescence Temperature Thermodynamics Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumour suppressor p53 is mutated in half of all human cancers, most frequently with missense substitutions in its core domain. We present a new assessment of the mutation database based on quantitative folding and DNA-binding studies of the isolated core domain. Our data identify five distinct mutant classes that correlate with four well-defined regions of the core domain structure. On extrapolation to 37 degrees C the wild-type protein has a stability of 3.0 kcal/mol. This also emerges as an oncogenic threshold: all beta-sandwich mutants destabilized by this amount (50% denatured) are expected to promote cancer. Other weakly destabilizing mutations are restricted to loop 3 in the DNA-binding region. Drugs that stabilize mutant p53 folding have the potential to reactivate apoptotic signalling pathways in tumour cells either by transactivation-dependent or independent pathways. Using an affinity ligand as a proof of principle we have recovered the thermodynamic stability of the hotspot G245S. With reference states for the five mutant classes as a guide, future therapeutic strategies may similarly stabilize partially structured or binding states of mutant p53 that restore limited p53 pathways to tumour suppression.	0
Role of p53 isoforms and aggregations in cancer. || Humans Neoplasms Protein Isoforms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a master regulatory protein that is involved in diverse cellular metabolic processes such as apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle arrest. The protective function of p53 (in its homotetrameric form) as a tumor suppressor is lost in more than 50% of human cancers.Despite considerable experimental evidence suggesting the presence of multiple p53 states, it has been difficult to correlate the status of p53 with cancer response to treatments and clinical outcomes, which suggest the importance of complex but essential p53 regulatory pathways.Recent studies have indicated that the expression pattern of p53 isoforms may play a crucial role in regulating normal and cancer cell fates in response to diverse stresses. The human TP53 gene encodes at least 12 p53 isoforms, which are produced in normal tissue through alternative initiation of translation, usage of alternative promoters, and alternative splicing. Furthermore, some researchers have suggested that the formation of mutant p53 aggregates may be associated with cancer pathogenesis due to loss-of function (LoF), dominant-negative (DN), and gain-of function (GoF) effects.As different isoforms or the aggregation state of p53 may influence tumorigenesis, this review aims to examine the correlation of p53 isoforms and aggregation with cancer.	0
MGMT promoter hypermethylation is a frequent, early, and consistent event in astrocytoma progression, and not correlated with TP53 mutation. || Adult Astrocytoma Brain Neoplasms DNA Methylation DNA Modification Methylases DNA Repair Enzymes Disease Progression Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis Promoter Regions, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Hypermethylation of the MGMT gene promoter and mutation of the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene are frequently present in diffuse astrocytomas. However, there is only anecdotal information about MGMT methylation status and TP53 mutations during progression of low-grade diffuse astrocytoma (AII) to anaplastic astrocytoma (AIII) and secondary glioblastoma (sGB). In this study biopsy specimens from 51 patients with astrocytic tumors with radiologically proved progression from low to high-grade malignancy were investigated for the presence and consistency of MGMT promoter hypermethylation and TP53 mutations. For 27 patients biopsy samples both of primary tumors and their recurrences were available. For the other 24 patients histology of either the low-grade lesion or the high-grade recurrence was available. It was found that MGMT promoter hypermethylation and TP53 mutations are both frequent and early events in the progression of astrocytomas and that their status is consistent over time. No correlation was found between MGMT methylation status and the presence of TP53 mutations. In addition, no correlation was found between MGMT promoter hypermethylation and the type of TP53 mutations. These results argue against the putative TP53 G:C>A:T transition mutations suggested to occur preferentially in MGMT hypermethylated tumors.	4
Engineered proteins with sensing and activating modules for automated reprogramming of cellular functions. || Animals Antigens, Differentiation CD47 Antigen Cells, Cultured Female Fibroblasts Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Humans Macrophages Mice, Inbred C57BL Phagocytosis Phosphorylation Protein Engineering Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Receptors, Immunologic Recombinant Proteins Signal Transduction Syk Kinase Tyrosine || Protein-based biosensors or activators have been engineered to visualize molecular signals or manipulate cellular functions. Here we integrate these two functionalities into one protein molecule, an integrated sensing and activating protein (iSNAP). A prototype that can detect tyrosine phosphorylation and immediately activate auto-inhibited Shp2 phosphatase, Shp2-iSNAP, is designed through modular assembly. When Shp2-iSNAP is fused to the SIRPα receptor which typically transduces anti-phagocytic signals from the 'don't eat me' CD47 ligand through negative Shp1 signaling, the engineered macrophages not only allow visualization of SIRPα phosphorylation upon CD47 engagement but also rewire the CD47-SIRPα axis into the positive Shp2 signaling, which enhances phagocytosis of opsonized tumor cells. A second SIRPα Syk-iSNAP with redesigned sensor and activator modules can likewise rewire the CD47-SIRPα axis to the pro-phagocytic Syk kinase activation. Thus, our approach can be extended to execute a broad range of sensing and automated reprogramming actions for directed therapeutics.Protein-based biosensors have been engineered to interrogate cellular signaling and manipulate function. Here the authors demonstrate iSNAP, a tool to detect tyrosine phosphorylation and activate desired protein enzymes allowing the control of phagocytosis in macrophages.	0
Long noncoding RNA PANDAR blocks CDKN1A gene transcription by competitive interaction with p53 protein in gastric cancer. ||  || Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs play important roles in cancer tumourigenesis and could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. However, the clinical significance and molecular mechanism of lncRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the expression and role of lncRNAs in GC. The relative expression level of lncRNAs in GC samples was examined by an lncRNA microarray analysis, northern blot analysis and qRT-PCR analysis. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed to evaluate the clinical and prognostic significance of PANDAR (promoter of CDKN1A antisense DNA damage activated RNA) in GC patients. The binding activity of PANDAR with the p53 protein was analysed by an RNA immunoprecipitation analysis and RNA pull-down analysis. The depletion of PANDAR was conducted using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for PANDAR. The biological functions of PANDAR in GC cells were determined both in vitro and in vivo. Upregulated PANDAR in GC patients was positively correlated with increased tumour size, advanced TNM classification and a poor survival rate in GC patients. The ROC curves identified that the PANDAR level was a marker for discriminating the early-stage tumour group from the healthy group, the metastasis group from the non-metastasis group and the chemoresistance group from the chemosensitive group in GC patients. As a target, the CDKN1A gene was successfully downregulated by PANDAR. PANDAR controlled the transcription of the CDKN1A gene by competitively binding with p53 protein. In combination with a p53 activator (nutlin3), the knockout of PANDAR by CRISPR/Cas9 technology synergistically inhibited GC tumour growth in vivo. Our results suggest that the PANDAR is a powerful diagnostic and therapeutic marker for patients with GC and, combined with other chemotherapeutics, may have distinct antitumour effects.	0
Mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlation of hearing loss patients caused by SLC26A4 mutations in the Japanese: a large cohort study. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexins Exons Female Gene Frequency Genetic Association Studies Genotype Hearing Loss Hearing Tests Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Japan Male Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Sulfate Transporters Tomography, X-Ray Computed Young Adult || Mutations in SLC26A4 cause a broad phenotypic spectrum, from typical Pendred syndrome to nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Identification of these mutations is important for accurate diagnosis, proper medical management and appropriate genetic counseling and requires updated information regarding spectrum, clinical characteristics and genotype-phenotype correlations, based on a large cohort. In 100 patients with bilateral enlarged vestibular aqueduct among 1511 Japanese hearing loss probands registered in our gene bank, goiter data were available for 79, of whom 15 had Pendred syndrome and 64 had nonsyndromic hearing loss. We clarified the mutation spectrum for the SLC26A4 mutations and also summarized hearing levels, progression, fluctuation and existence of genotype-phenotype correlation. SLC26A4 mutations were identified in 82 of the 100 patients (82.0%). Of the Pendred syndrome patients, 93% (14/15) were carriers, as were 77% (49/64) of the nonsyndromic hearing loss patients. Clinical characteristics of patients with SLC26A4 mutations were congenital, fluctuating and progressive hearing loss usually associated with vertigo and/or goiter. We found no genotype-phenotype correlations, indicating that, unlike in the case of GJB2 mutations, the phenotype cannot be predicted from the genotype. Our mutation analysis confirmed the importance of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene among hearing loss patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct and revealed the mutation spectrum, essential information when performing genetic testing.	1
Sudden infant death in a patient with FGFR3 P250R mutation. || Adult Airway Obstruction Amino Acid Substitution Craniosynostoses Female Humans Infant, Newborn Point Mutation Pregnancy Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome || P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities. We report a family with this mutation associated with sudden death in an affected newborn, most probably due to upper airway obstruction.	4
Distal phalangeal creases--a distinctive dysmorphic feature in disorders of the RAS signalling pathway? || Child, Preschool Female Finger Phalanges Humans Noonan Syndrome Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction Skin Abnormalities ras Proteins || We have observed unusual transverse distal phalangeal creases in two patients, one with Costello syndrome (G12S mutation in the HRAS gene) and one with cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome or possibly Noonan syndrome (Q22E mutation in the KRAS gene). This feature along with fetal pads was present in both children at birth and has persisted until age two years. Distal phalangeal creases, when present, may be a good diagnostic handle for syndromes belonging to the RAS signalling pathway.	4
The clinical value of somatic TP53 gene mutations in 1,794 patients with breast cancer. || Aged Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis Survival Analysis Survival Rate Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || To investigate the clinical value of somatic TP53 mutations in breast cancer, we assembled clinical and molecular data on 1,794 women with primary breast cancer with long-term follow-up and whose tumor has been screened for mutation in exons 5 to 8 of TP53 by gene sequencing. TP53 mutations were more frequent in tumors of ductal and medullar types, aggressive phenotype (high grade, large size, node positive cases, and low hormone receptor content) and in women <60 years old. TP53 mutations within exons 5 to 8 conferred an elevated risk of breast cancer-specific death of 2.27 (relative risk >10 years; P < 0.0001) compared with patients with no such mutation. The prognostic value of TP53 mutation was independent of tumor size, node status, and hormone receptor content, confirming and reconciling previous findings in smaller series. Moreover, an interaction between TP53 mutation and progesterone receptor (PR) status was revealed, TP53 mutation combined with the absence of progesterone receptor being associated with the worst prognosis. Whereas previous studies have emphasized the fact that missense mutations in the DNA-binding motifs have a worse prognosis than missense mutations outside these motifs, we show that non-missense mutations have prognostic value similar to missense mutations in DNA-binding motifs. Nonetheless, specific missense mutants (codon 179 and R248W) seem to be associated with an even worse prognosis. These results, obtained on the largest series analyzed thus far, show that TP53 mutations identified by gene sequencing have an independent prognostic value in breast cancer and could have potential uses in clinical practice.	4
Maternal phenylketonuria syndrome in cousins caused by mild, unrecognized phenylketonuria in their mothers homozygous for the phenylalanine hydroxylase Arg-261-Gln mutation. || Adult Arginine Base Sequence Female Glutamine Homozygote Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Microcephaly Molecular Sequence Data Mothers Mutation Pedigree Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || Intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, and developmental delay in two first cousins lead to the recognition of phenylketonuria (PKU) in their mothers, 24- and 23 year-old sisters with blood phenylalanine concentrations of approx. 1.2 mmol/l who had never been treated and had no overt mental retardation. Both mothers were shown to be homozygous for a point mutation leading to an Arg-to-Gln substitution at codon 261 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, a mutation which has been recently identified and tentatively associated with a mild variant of PKU. Our observation suggests that homozygosity for the Arg-261-Gln mutation can indeed result in "mild" PKU with little or perhaps no mental retardation, but also indicates that in such women, who may go unrecognized if not screened for, blood phenylalanine is elevated enough to cause the maternal PKU syndrome in their offspring.	3
Targeting of mutant p53-induced FoxM1 with thiostrepton induces cytotoxicity and enhances carboplatin sensitivity in cancer cells. || Animals Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Apoptosis Carboplatin Cell Line, Tumor Drug Synergism Female Forkhead Box Protein M1 Forkhead Transcription Factors HEK293 Cells Humans Imidazoles Mice Mice, Nude Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Piperazines Thiostrepton Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || FoxM1 is an oncogenic Forkhead transcription factor that is overexpressed in ovarian cancer. However, the mechanisms by which FoxM1 is deregulated in ovarian cancer and the extent to which FoxM1 can be targeted in ovarian cancer have not been reported previously. In this study, we showed that MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 upregulated p53 protein and downregulated FoxM1 expression in several cancer cell lines with wild type TP53 but not in cell lines with mutant TP53. FoxM1 downregulation was partially blocked by cycloheximide or actinomycin D, and pulse-chase studies indicate Nutlin-3 enhances FoxM1 mRNA decay. Knockdown of p53 using shRNAs abrogated the FoxM1 downregulation by Nutlin-3, indicating a p53-dependent mechanism. FoxM1 inhibitor, thiostrepton, induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines and enhances sensitivity to cisplatin in these cells. Thiostrepton downregulates FoxM1 expression in several cancer cell lines and enhances sensitivity to carboplatin in vivo. Finally, FoxM1 expression is elevated in nearly all (48/49) ovarian tumors, indicating that thiostrepton target gene is highly expressed in ovarian cancer. In summary, the present study provides novel evidence that both amorphic and neomorphic mutations in TP53 contribute to FoxM1 overexpression and that FoxM1 may be targeted for therapeutic benefits in cancers.	0
Connexin 26 preverbal hearing impairment: mutation prevalence and heterozygosity in a selected population. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 Connexin 26 Connexins Female Gene Frequency Hearing Disorders Heterozygote Humans Infant Male Point Mutation Prevalence || The objective of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of Cx26 mutations in familial and sporadic cases of non-syndromic preverbal hearing impairment (HI). Molecular analysis of the Connexin 26 (Cx26/GJB2) gene was performed in 271 non-consanguineous individuals from the north of Italy, enrolled in the study because of the presence of non-syndromic preverbal sensorineural HI. One hundred and forty-six subjects (group 1) were referred from different ENT, paediatric and clinical genetic services, while 125 individuals (group 2) underwent Cx26 analysis based on precise anamnestic and clinical criteria for non-syndromic HI and low risk of acquired deficit. All of the cases were also classified as familial or sporadic due to the presence or absence of other documented childhood HI in the family. Of the total 271 individuals, 36.9% were positive for Cx26 mutations: 37 belonged to group 1 and 63 to group 2, which delineates a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The difference is mainly attributable to sporadically occurring cases. No significant differences between group 1 and group 2 were found regarding the prevalence of the common 35delG variant and the number of unidentified putative Cx26 alleles, although these latter were shown to be higher in sporadically occurring cases of the unselected group 1. The difference observed in Cx26 prevalence can be explained by the clinical selection of group 2, which ensures minimum risk of including cases of acquired HI. In particular, in cases of sporadically occurring HI, the use of a defined protocol increases the chances of a positive molecular result, improving genetic counselling and the possibility of establishing better genotype-phenotype correlation. Our data raise questions about the possible interpretation of Cx26 heterozygosity in a selected population of hearing-impaired individuals.	4
DNA repair genes are selectively mutated in diffuse large B cell lymphomas. || Alleles Checkpoint Kinase 2 Cohort Studies DNA End-Joining Repair DNA Mismatch Repair DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Repair Female Genetic Loci Genetic Variation Germ-Line Mutation Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse Male Microsatellite Instability Mutation Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Sequence Analysis, DNA Translocation, Genetic || DNA repair mechanisms are fundamental for B cell development, which relies on the somatic diversification of the immunoglobulin genes by V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation, and class switch recombination. Their failure is postulated to promote genomic instability and malignant transformation in B cells. By performing targeted sequencing of 73 key DNA repair genes in 29 B cell lymphoma samples, somatic and germline mutations were identified in various DNA repair pathways, mainly in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). Mutations in mismatch repair genes (EXO1, MSH2, and MSH6) were associated with microsatellite instability, increased number of somatic insertions/deletions, and altered mutation signatures in tumors. Somatic mutations in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes (DCLRE1C/ARTEMIS, PRKDC/DNA-PKcs, XRCC5/KU80, and XRCC6/KU70) were identified in four DLBCL tumors and cytogenetic analyses revealed that translocations involving the immunoglobulin-heavy chain locus occurred exclusively in NHEJ-mutated samples. The novel mutation targets, CHEK2 and PARP1, were further screened in expanded DLBCL cohorts, and somatic as well as novel and rare germline mutations were identified in 8 and 5% of analyzed tumors, respectively. By correlating defects in a subset of DNA damage response and repair genes with genomic instability events in tumors, we propose that these genes play a role in DLBCL lymphomagenesis.	4
ACMG recommendations for standards for interpretation and reporting of sequence variations: Revisions 2007. || Base Sequence Databases, Genetic Genetic Variation Genetics, Medical Humans Research Design Terminology as Topic || ACMG previously developed recommendations for standards for interpretation of sequence variations. We now present the updated revised recommendations. Here, we describe six interpretative categories of sequence variations: (1) sequence variation is previously reported and is a recognized cause of the disorder; (2) sequence variation is previously unreported and is of the type which is expected to cause the disorder; (3) sequence variation is previously unreported and is of the type which may or may not be causative of the disorder; (4) sequence variation is previously unreported and is probably not causative of disease; (5) sequence variation is previously reported and is a recognized neutral variant; and (6) sequence variation is previously not known or expected to be causative of disease, but is found to be associated with a clinical presentation. We emphasize the importance of appropriate reporting of sequence variations using standardized terminology and established databases, and of clearly reporting the limitations of sequence-based testing. We discuss follow-up studies that may be used to ascertain the clinical significance of sequence variations, including the use of additional tools (such as predictive software programs) that may be useful in variant classification. As more information becomes available allowing the interpretation of a new sequence variant, it is recommended that the laboratory amend previous reports and provide updated results to the physician. The ACMG strongly recommends that the clinical and technical validation of sequence variation detection be performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory and interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent.	4
[Non-invasive screening for GJB2 mutations in buccal smears for the diagnosis of inherited hearing impairment]. ||  || Approximately 1 out of 1000 children is affected by severe or profound hearing impairment at birth. In the last years it has been shown that more than 50 % of inherited prelingual, sensorineural hearing impairment may be attributed to genetic defects. Most commonly, the GJB2 gene (chromosome 13q11) that encodes connexin 26 (Cx26) is affected. Cx26 is crucial for the formation of gap junctions which play an important role in the intercellular exchange of electrolytes. A variety of autosomal recessive GJB2 mutations associated with inherited hearing impairment has meanwhile been identified. The most common GJB2 mutation in Caucasian populations, 35delG accounts for the majority of cases and has a carrier frequency of more than 2.5 %. Other distinct mutations account for hearing impairment in other parts of the world. We examined in 59 Caucasian and Ghanaian individuals whether DNA recovered from buccal smears was appropriate for genetic testing by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) based DNA-sequencing. Buccal smears could be taken conveniently in all cases, even from small babies. In 53 out of 59 samples the material recovered from buccal smears could be subjected to PCR of the second exon of the GJB2 gene and subsequent DNA-sequencing. GJB2 mutations were identified in 34 patients. 13 Caucasian individuals exhibited the most common mutation 35delG. In addition, four cases of the rare W24X and each one heterozygous case of the V153I- and the L90P mutation were found. In two African individuals the 35insG mutation was detected. All other African patients had mutations exclusively identified in Ghana so far with the exception of R143W. R143W accounts for most cases of profound deafness in Ghana and has been identified in low frequencies in other ethnic groups as well. Screening for GJB2 mutations in DNA recovered from buccal smears of individuals with inherited hearing impairment offers an easy, non-invasive method for early diagnosis and a basis of genetic counselling.	4
Clinical performance evaluation of the Idylla NRAS-BRAF mutation test on retrospectively collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissue. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Female Formaldehyde GTP Phosphohydrolases Gene Expression Profiling Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Paraffin Embedding Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Retrospective Studies Tissue Fixation Young Adult || Understanding the molecular mechanisms of underlying disease has led to a movement away from the one-drug-fits-all paradigm towards treatment tailored to the genetic profile of the patient. The Biocartis Idylla platform is a novel fully automated, real-time PCR-based in vitro diagnostic system. The Idylla NRAS-BRAF mutation test has been developed for the qualitative detection of mutations inNRAS andBRAF oncogenes, facilitating genetic profiling of patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to carry out a formal clinical performance evaluation. Two-hundred and forty-two formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human malignant colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue samples were identified in departmental archives and tested with both the Idylla NRAS-BRAF mutation test and the Agena Bioscience MassARRAY test. The overall concordance between the Idylla NRAS-BRAF mutation test and the MassARRAY comparator reference test result was 241/242 (99.59%, lower bound of one-sided 95% CI=98.1%) for NRAS and 242/242 (lower bound of 95% one-sided 95% CI=98.89%) forBRAF. The Idylla NRAS-BRAF test detected oneNRAS mutation that had not been reported by the MassARRAY comparator reference test. Reanalysis of this sample by droplet digital PCR confirmed that the mutation was present, but at an allelic frequency below the stated sensitivity level of the MassARRAY system. These results confirm that the Idylla NRAS-BRAF mutation test has high concordance with a widely used NRAS-BRAF test, and is therefore suitable for use as anin vitro diagnostic device for this application.	4
The Large Phenotypic Spectrum of Fabry Disease Requires Graduated Diagnosis and Personalized Therapy: A Meta-Analysis Can Help to Differentiate Missense Mutations. || 1-Deoxynojirimycin Fabry Disease Humans Molecular Chaperones Mutation, Missense Precision Medicine Small Molecule Libraries alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease is caused by mutations in the GLA gene and is characterized by a large genotypic and phenotypic spectrum. Missense mutations pose a special problem for graduating diagnosis and choosing a cost-effective therapy. Some mutants retain enzymatic activity, but are less stable than the wild type protein. These mutants can be stabilized by small molecules which are defined as pharmacological chaperones. The first chaperone to reach clinical trial is 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin, but others have been tested in vitro. Residual activity ofGLA mutants has been measured in the presence or absence of pharmacological chaperones by several authors. Data obtained from transfected cells correlate with those obtained in cells derived from patients, regardless of whether 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin was present or not. The extent to which missense mutations respond to 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin is variable and a reference table of the results obtained by independent groups that is provided with this paper can facilitate the choice of eligible patients. A review of other pharmacological chaperones is provided as well. Frequent mutations can have residual activity as low as one-fourth of normal enzyme in vitro. The reference table with residual activity of the mutants facilitates the identification of non-pathological variants.	0
High Intra- and Inter-Tumoral Heterogeneity of RAS Mutations in Colorectal Cancer. || Adult Aged Antibodies, Monoclonal Cetuximab Colorectal Neoplasms Drug Resistance, Neoplasm ErbB Receptors Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Approximately 30% of patients with wild type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer are non-responders to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies (anti-EGFR mAbs), possibly due to undetected tumoral subclones harboringRAS mutations. The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution ofRAS mutations in different areas of the primary tumor, metastatic lymph nodes and distant metastasis. A retrospective cohort of 18 patients with a colorectal cancer (CRC) was included in the study. Multiregion analysis was performed in 60 spatially separated tumor areas according to the pathological tumor node metastasis (pTNM) staging andKRAS,NRAS andBRAF mutations were tested using pyrosequencing. In primary tumors, intra-tumoral heterogeneity forRAS mutation was found in 33% of cases. Inter-tumoral heterogeneity forRAS mutation between primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes or distant metastasis was found in 36% of cases. Moreover, 28% of tumors had multipleRAS mutated subclones in the same tumor. A high proportion of CRCs presented intra- and/or inter-tumoral heterogeneity, which has relevant clinical implications for anti-EGFR mAbs prescription. These results suggest the need for multipleRAS testing in different parts of the same tumor and/or more sensitive techniques.	4
Detecting N-RAS Q61R Mutated Thyroid Neoplasias by Immunohistochemistry. || Adult Aged DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Reproducibility of Results Thyroid Neoplasms || Recently, the immunohistochemistry (IHC) for N-RAS Q61R has been developed and commercialized for clinical practice. Here, we investigated the reliability of IHC to identify N-RAS Q61R mutated thyroid neoplasia. A series of 24 consecutive thyroid lesions undergone surgery following indeterminate cytology were enrolled. Paraffin sections were stained for IHC using the rabbit monoclonal anti-human N-RAS Q61R, clone SP174. N-RAS mutations in codon 61 were also investigated by automated sequencing. At histology, 12 cases of follicular carcinoma, cytologically defined as follicular lesions, 1 papillary cancer, 7 follicular adenomas, and 4 hyperplastic nodules were found. Of these, 4 showed a positive IHC for anti N-RAS antibody where N-RAS expression was detected mainly at cytoplasmic level with similar intensity of reaction. The remaining cases had negative IHC. A 100% concordance between IHC and molecular analysis for N-RAS Q61R was observed. In conclusion, this study shows high reliability of IHC to identify N-RAS Q61R mutated thyroid lesions with high cost-effectiveness. These data indicate the reliability of IHC to identify N-RAS Q61R mutated thyroid neoplasia and suggest to adopt this approach for a more accurate management of patients, when indicated.	4
Porokeratotic eccrine nevus may be caused by somatic connexin26 mutations. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Humans Ichthyosis Keratitis Mutation Nevus Porokeratosis Skin Neoplasms || Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, or porokeratotic eccrine nevus (PEN), is a hyperkeratotic epidermal nevus. Several cases of widespread involvement have been reported, including one in association with the keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome (OMIM #148210), a rare disorder caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene coding for the gap junction protein connexin26 (Cx26). The molecular cause is, as yet, unknown. We have noted that PEN histopathology is shared by KID. The clinical appearance of PEN can resemble that of KID syndrome. Furthermore, a recent report of cutaneous mosaicism for a GJB2 mutation associated with KID describes linear hyperkeratotic skin lesions that might be consistent with PEN. From this, we hypothesized that PEN might be caused by Cx26 mutations associated with KID or similar gap junction disorders. Thus, we analyzed the GJB2 gene in skin samples from two patients referred with generalized PEN. In both, we found GJB2 mutations in the PEN lesions but not in unaffected skin or peripheral blood. One mutation was already known to cause the KID syndrome, and the other had not been previously associated with skin symptoms. We provide extensive functional data to support its pathogenicity. We conclude that PEN may be caused by mosaic GJB2 mutations.	4
Comparative functional characterization of novel non-syndromic GJB2 gene variant p.Gly45Arg and lethal syndromic variant p.Gly45Glu. ||  || We characterized a novel GJB2 missense variant, c.133G>A, p.Gly45Arg, and compared it with the only other variant at the same amino acid position of the connexin 26 protein (Cx26) reported to date: c.134G>A, p.Gly45Glu. Whereas both variants are associated with hearing loss and are dominantly inherited, p.Gly45Glu has been implicated in the rare fatal keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, which results in cutaneous infections and septicemia with premature demise in the first year of life. In contrast, p.Gly45Arg appears to be non-syndromic. Subcellular localization experiments in transiently co-transfected HeLa cells demonstrated that Cx26-WT (wild-type) and p.Gly45Arg form gap junctions, whereas Cx26-WT with p.Gly45Glu protein does not. The substitution of a nonpolar amino acid glycine in wildtype Cx26 at position 45 with a negatively charged glutamic acid (acidic) has previously been shown to interfere with Ca2+ regulation of hemichannel gating and to inhibit the formation of gap junctions, resulting in cell death. The novel variant p.Gly45Arg, however, changes this glycine to a positively charged arginine (basic), resulting in the formation of dysfunctional gap junctions that selectively affect the permeation of negatively charged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and contribute to hearing loss. Cx26 p.Gly45Arg transfected cells, unlike cells transfected with p.Gly45Glu, thrived at physiologic Ca2+ concentrations, suggesting that Ca2+ regulation of hemichannel gating is unaffected in Cx26 p.Gly45Arg transfected cells. Thus, the two oppositely charged amino acids that replace the highly conserved uncharged glycine in p.Gly45Glu and p.Gly45Arg, respectively, produce strikingly different effects on the structure and function of the Cx26 protein.	0
Virtual screening and biological evaluation of inhibitors targeting the XPA-ERCC1 interaction. || Cell Line, Tumor Culture Media DNA DNA Repair DNA-Binding Proteins Endonucleases Humans Inhibitory Concentration 50 Kinetics Ligands Models, Chemical Models, Molecular Models, Statistical Molecular Dynamics Simulation Protein Binding Protein Conformation Solubility Static Electricity Ultraviolet Rays Xeroderma Pigmentosum Group A Protein || Nucleotide excision repair (NER) removes many types of DNA lesions including those induced by UV radiation and platinum-based therapy. Resistance to platinum-based therapy correlates with high expression of ERCC1, a major element of the NER machinery. The interaction between ERCC1 and XPA is essential for a successful NER function. Therefore, one way to regulate NER is by inhibiting the activity of ERCC1 and XPA. Here we continued our earlier efforts aimed at the identification and characterization of novel inhibitors of the ERCC1-XPA interaction. We used a refined virtual screening approach combined with a biochemical and biological evaluation of the compounds for their ability to interact with ERCC1 and to sensitize cells to UV radiation. Our findings reveal a new validated ERCC1-XPA inhibitor that significantly sensitized colon cancer cells to UV radiation indicating a strong inhibition of the ERCC1-XPA interaction. NER is a major factor in acquiring resistance to platinum-based therapy. Regulating the NER pathway has the potential of improving the efficacy of platinum treatments. One approach that we followed is to inhibit the essential interaction between the two NER elements, ERCC1 and XPA. Here, we performed virtual screening against the ERCC1-XPA interaction and identified novel inhibitors that block the XPA-ERCC1 binding. The identified inhibitors significantly sensitized colon cancer cells to UV radiation indicating a strong inhibition of the ERCC1-XPA interaction.	0
GCK and HNF1A mutations in Canadian families with maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). ||  || Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous form of type 2 diabetes that is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, onset in early adulthood and a primary defect in insulin secretion. Mutations in at least six genes have been shown to underlie MODY, including mutations in GCK (encoding glucokinase, also called MODY2) and mutations in HNF1A (encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha, also called MODY3). We sequenced genomic DNA from probands of seven Canadian MODY families. In four probands, we detected four novel GCK mutations, namely IVS2-7G>A, G72R, T206R and S263P. In three other probands, we detected three HNF1A mutations, of which two were novel, namely 1051delCA and Q250X, and one had been previously reported, namely R131Q. The novel mutations expand the spectrum of MODY mutations. In addition, knowledge of the specific defect can be used to pre-symptomatically identify family members at risk for developing MODY.	4
Identification & Characterization of lactobacillus salavarius bacteriocins and its relevance in cancer therapeutics. ||  || Therapeutic agents with a goal to eradicate cancer needs to capable of inhibiting the growth and kill, any preformed tumor and should also inhibit oncogenic transformation of normal cells to cancer cells. Bacteriocins are bacterial proteins produced to prevent the growth of competing microorganisms in a particular biological niche and have been proved to possess antineoplastic activity. The entire genome of Lactobacillus salavarius was scanned for putative bacteriocins and subsequently these bacteriocins were characterized by subjecting them as functional annotation algorithms. Azurin is a well characterized bacteriocins with proven cytostatic and apoptotic effect against human cancer cell and was taken as control. Functional characterization revealed that the three bacteriocins Lsl_003, Lsl_0510, Lsl_0554 possessed functional properties very similar to that of Azurin. Molecular screening of these bacteriocins against the common cancer targets p53, Rb1 and AR revealed that Lsl_0510 possessed highest binding affinity towards the all the three receptors making it to ideal candidate for future cancer therapeutics. P53 - Protein 53, Rb1 - Retinoblastoma 1, AR - Androgen Receptor, Lsl - Lactobacillus salavarius.	0
BRET-based RAS biosensors that show a novel small molecule is an inhibitor of RAS-effector protein-protein interactions. || Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Techniques Biosensing Techniques Energy Transfer HEK293 Cells Humans Mutation Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction Small Molecule Libraries || The RAS family of proteins is amongst the most highly mutated in human cancers and has so far eluded drug therapy. Currently, much effort is being made to discover mutant RAS inhibitors and in vitro screening for RAS-binding drugs must be followed by cell-based assays. Here, we have developed a robust set of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based RAS biosensors that enable monitoring of RAS-effector interaction inhibition in living cells. These include KRAS, HRAS and NRAS and a variety of different mutations that mirror those found in human cancers with the major RAS effectors such as CRAF, PI3K and RALGDS. We highlighted the utility of these RAS biosensors by showing a RAS-binding compound is a potent pan-RAS-effector interactions inhibitor in cells. The RAS biosensors represent a useful tool to investigate and characterize the potency of anti-RAS inhibitors in cells and more generally any RAS protein-protein interaction (PPI) in cells.	0

Here we define a novel gain-of-function of mutant p53 (mutp53), whereby mutp53-overexpressing cancer cells acquire superior tolerance to proteotoxic stress. mutp53 via constitutive stimulation of EGFR and ErbB2 signaling hyperactivates the MAPK and PI3K cascades, which induce stabilization and phosphoactivation of HSF1 on Ser326. Moreover, mutp53 protein via direct interaction with activated p-Ser326 HSF1 facilitates HSF1 recruitment to its specific DNA-binding elements and stimulates transcription of heat-shock proteins including Hsp90. In turn, induced Hsp90 stabilizes its oncogenic clients including EGFR, ErbB2 and mutp53, thereby further reinforcing oncogenic signaling. Thus, mutp53 initiates a feed forward loop that renders cancer cells more resistant to adverse conditions, providing a strong survival advantage.	0
Next‑generation sequencing‑based detection of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, Her‑2 and TP53 mutations in patients with non‑small cell lung cancer. || Aged Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases ErbB Receptors Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Receptor, ErbB-2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || In recent years, the incidence of non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has become the highest lethal rate of cancer worldwide. Molecular assays of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA and Her‑2 are widely used to guide individualized treatment in NSCLC patients. Somatic mutations in 112 NSCLC patients, including 7 oncogenic driver genes, were detected by Iontorrent personal genome machine (PGM). Sanger sequencing was used to test and verify the results of PGM. Apart from uncommon mutations of EGFR, 101 NSCLC specimens were tested by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). According to NGS results, mutations were detected in EGFR (58/112, 51.79% of tumors), KRAS (10/112, 8.93%), BRAF (2/112, 1.79%), NRAS (2/112, 1.79%), Her‑2 (2/112, 1.79%), PIK3CA (6/112, 5.36%) and TP53 (31/112, 27.69%). There were 27 samples without any somatic mutations in all genes while 24 samples harboured mutations in two or more genes. A total of 61 samples had one or more mutations in a single gene. All alterations of 7 genes were presented and the overall detection rate of NGS and Sanger sequencing was determined to be 51.79% (58/112) and 37.50% (42/112), respectively (χ2=5.88, P=0.015). Compared with Sanger sequencing, the total sensitivity and specificity of NGS assays was 95.24% (40/42) and 77.14% (54/70), respectively. The overall detection rate of NGS and ddPCR was 45.54% (46/101) and 47.52% (48/101), respectively (χ2=0.000598, P=0.98). Compared with ddPCR, the overall sensitivity and specificity of NGS assays was 95.83% (46/48) and 98.11% (52/53), respectively. The findings indicated that the positive mutation rate of EGFR tested by NGS was significantly lower than that by Sanger sequencing, but the difference between ddPCR and NGS was not statistically significant. The high degree of agreement of reportable variants is proposed in both NGS and ddPCR analysis, suggesting the performance of NGS assays in routine clinical detection may be useful in determining the treatment decisions in NSCLC patients.	4
Alterations in Mitochondrial and Endoplasmic Reticulum Signaling by p53 Mutants. ||  || The p53 protein is probably the most important tumor suppressor, acting as a nuclear transcription factor primarily through the modulation of cell death. However, currently, it is well accepted that p53 can also exert important transcription-independent pro-cell death actions. Indeed, cytosolic localization of endogenous wild-type or transactivation-deficient p53 is necessary and sufficient for the induction of apoptosis and autophagy. Here, we present the extra-nuclear activities of p53 associated with the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, highlighting the activities of the p53 mutants on these compartments. These two intracellular organelles play crucial roles in the regulation of cell death, and it is now well established that they also represent sites where p53 can accumulate.	0
APPL proteins modulate DNA repair and radiation survival of pancreatic carcinoma cells by regulating ATM. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins Cell Survival DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded DNA Repair Endosomes Enzyme Activation Gene Knockdown Techniques Humans Pancreatic Neoplasms Phosphorylation Protein Binding Radiation Tolerance X-Rays || Despite intensive multimodal therapies, the overall survival rate of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is still poor. The chemo- and radioresistance mechanisms of this tumor entity remain to be determined in order to develop novel treatment strategies. In cancer, endocytosis and membrane trafficking proteins are known to be utilized and they also critically regulate essential cell functions like survival and proliferation. On the basis of these data, we evaluated the role of the endosomal proteins adaptor proteins containing pleckstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain and a leucine zipper motif (APPL)1 and 2 for the radioresistance of pancreatic carcinoma cells. Here, we show that APPL2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells is upregulated after irradiation and that depletion of APPL proteins by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly reduced radiation survival in parallel to impairing DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. In addition, APPL knockdown diminished radiogenic hyperphosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Activated ATM and APPL1 were also shown to interact after irradiation, suggesting that APPL has a more direct role in the phosphorylation of ATM. Double targeting of APPL proteins and ATM caused similar radiosensitization and concomitant DSB repair perturbation to that observed after depletion of single proteins, indicating that ATM is the central modulator of APPL-mediated effects on radiosensitivity and DNA repair. These data strongly suggest that endosomal APPL proteins contribute to the DNA damage response. Whether targeting of APPL proteins is beneficial for the survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains to be elucidated.	0
Mitochondrial DNA variant m.15218A > G in Finnish epilepsy patients who have maternal relatives with epilepsy, sensorineural hearing impairment or diabetes mellitus. || Base Sequence DNA, Mitochondrial Diabetes Mellitus Epilepsy Female Finland Genetic Variation Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mitochondria Mitochondrial Diseases Pedigree Phylogeny Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Analysis, DNA || Mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) affect tissues with high energy demand. Epilepsy is one of the manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction when the brain is affected. We have studied here 79 Finnish patients with epilepsy and who have maternal first- or second-degree relatives with epilepsy, sensorineural hearing impairment or diabetes mellitus. The entire mtDNA was studied by using conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis and PCR fragments that differed in mobility were directly sequenced. We found a common nonsynonymous variant m.15218A > G (p.T158A, MTCYB) that occurs in haplogroup U5a1 to be more frequent in patients with epilepsy. The m.15218A > G variant was present in five patients with epilepsy and in four out of 403 population controls (p = 0.0077). This variant was present in two branches in the phylogenetic network constructed on the basis of mtDNA variation among the patients. Three algorithms predicted that m.15218A > G is damaging in effect. We suggest that the m.15218A > G variant is mildly deleterious and that mtDNA involvement should be considered in patients with epilepsy and who have a maternal history of epilepsy, sensorineural hearing impairment or diabetes mellitus.	4
MicroRNA Profiling Implies New Markers of Gemcitabine Chemoresistance in Mutant p53 Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. || Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Cell Line, Tumor Cluster Analysis Computational Biology Deoxycytidine Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Profiling Genes, p53 Humans MicroRNAs Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms RNA Interference RNA, Messenger Reproducibility of Results || No reliable predictors of susceptibility to gemcitabine chemotherapy exist in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). MicroRNAs (miR) are epigenetic gene regulators with tumorsuppressive or oncogenic roles in various carcinomas. This study assesses chemoresistant PDAC for its specific miR expression pattern. Gemcitabine-resistant variants of two mutant p53 human PDAC cell lines were established. Survival rates were analyzed by cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays. Expression of 1733 human miRs was investigated by microarray and validated by qRT-PCR. After in-silico analysis of specific target genes and proteins of dysregulated miRs, expression of MRP-1, Bcl-2, mutant p53, and CDK1 was quantified by Western blot. Both established PDAC clones showed a significant resistance to gemcitabine (p<0.02) with low apoptosis rate (p<0.001) vs. parental cells. MiR-screening revealed significantly upregulated (miR-21, miR-99a, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-138, miR-210) and downregulated miRs (miR-31*, miR-330, miR-378) in chemoresistant PDAC (p<0.05). Bioinformatic analysis suggested involvement of these miRs in pathways controlling cell death and cycle. MRP-1 (p<0.02) and Bcl-2 (p<0.003) were significantly overexpressed in both resistant cell clones and mutant p53 (p = 0.023) in one clone. Consistent miR expression profiles, in part regulated by mutant TP53 gene, were identified in gemcitabine-resistant PDAC with significant MRP-1 and Bcl-2 overexpression. These results provide a basis for further elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms and therapeutic approaches to overcome chemoresistance in PDAC.	0
Prenatal screening for the 35delG GJB2, del (GJB6-D13S1830), and del (GJB6-D13S1854) mutations in the Romanian population. || Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Genetic Diseases, Inborn Genetic Loci Humans Male Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis Romania Sequence Deletion || In this study, the aim of prenatal screening was to estimate the carrier frequency of the three mutations 35delG, del (GJB6-D13S1830), and del (GJB6-D13S1854), which are known to be the leading mutations of hereditary hearing loss in European populations. We performed a prenatal screening to assess the carrier frequency of the most common mutations at the DFNB1 gene locus in the general population. Samples of amniotic fluid (n=339) and chorionic villi (n=11) were taken from an unselected group of 350 unrelated pregnant women with normal hearing. Genomic fetal DNA was extracted and analyzed by PCR multiplex assays. The rate of carriers for the 35delG GJB2 mutation was 3.14%, comparable to that of most Southeastern European populations. All samples were negative for GJB6-D13S1830 and GJB6-D13S1854 deletions. The genetic tests were considered for carrier detection and early diagnosis rather than termination of pregnancy. Our study suggests a need for detecting the carriers. This is the first step for the construction of a national database and provides information for health planners and policy makers to help them in planning programs and allocation resources. The molecular testing was well received by pregnant women and appears to be feasible and highly acceptable.	4
Alternative mechanisms of miR-34a regulation in cancer. || Animals Epigenesis, Genetic Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans MicroRNAs Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || MicroRNA miR-34a is recognized as a master regulator of tumor suppression. The strategy of miR-34a replacement has been investigated in clinical trials as the first attempt of miRNA application in cancer treatment. However, emerging outcomes promote the re-evaluation of existing knowledge and urge the need for better understanding the complex biological role of miR-34a. The targets of miR-34a encompass numerous regulators of cancer cell proliferation, survival and resistance to therapy. MiR-34a expression is transcriptionally controlled by p53, a crucial tumor suppressor pathway, often disrupted in cancer. Moreover, miR-34a abundance is fine-tuned by context-dependent feedback loops. The function and effects of exogenously delivered or re-expressed miR-34a on the background of defective p53 therefore remain prominent issues in miR-34a based therapy. In this work, we review p53-independent mechanisms regulating the expression of miR-34a. Aside from molecules directly interacting with MIR34A promoter, processes affecting epigenetic regulation and miRNA maturation are discussed. Multiple mechanisms operate in the context of cancer-associated phenomena, such as aberrant oncogene signaling, EMT or inflammation. Since p53-dependent tumor-suppressive mechanisms are disturbed in a substantial proportion of malignancies, we summarize the effects of miR-34a modulation in cell and animal models in the clinically relevant context of disrupted or insufficient p53 function.	0
Lipoprotein metabolism in familial hypercholesterolemia: Serial assessment using a one-step ultracentrifugation method. ||  || It is well known that familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common inherited disorder that can markedly elevate the level of plasma LDL cholesterol. However, little data exists regarding the clinical impact of the plasma triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein fraction, including VLDL and IDL, in FH. Thus, we assessed the hypothesis that the mutations in the LDL receptor modulate lipoprotein metabolism other than the LDL fraction. We investigated plasma lipoprotein with a one-step ultracentrifugation method for 146 controls (mean age=61.4±17.1 yr, mean LDL cholesterol=92.7±61.2 mg/dl), 213 heterozygous mutation-determined FH subjects (mean age=46.0±18.0 yr, mean LDL cholesterol=225.1±61.2 mg/dl), and 16 homozygous/compound heterozygous mutation-determined FH subjects (mean age=26.9±17.1 yr, mean LDL cholesterol=428.6±86.1 mg/dl). In addition, we evaluated cholesterol/TG ratio in each lipoprotein fraction separated by ultracentrifugation. In addition to total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, VLDL cholesterol (19.5±10.4, 25.2±19.3, 29.5±21.4 mg/dl, respectively) and IDL cholesterol (8.3±3.7, 16.8±11.5, 40.0±37.3 mg/dl, respectively) exhibited a tri-model distribution according to their status in LDL receptor mutation(s). Moreover, the ratios of cholesterol/TG of each lipoprotein fraction increased significantly in heterozygous FH and homozygous/compound heterozygous FH groups, compared with that of controls, suggesting that the abnormality in LDL receptor modulates the quality as well as the quantity of each lipoprotein fraction. Our results indicate that cholesterol in TG-rich lipoproteins, including VLDL and IDL, are significantly higher in FH subjects, revealing a tri-modal distribution according to the number of LDL receptor mutations.	4

Evaluation of newborn screening bloodspot-based genetic testing as second tier screen for bedside newborn hearing screening. ||  || : Bedside newborn hearing screening is highly successful in identifying deaf or hard-of-hearing infants. However, newborn hearing screening protocols have high loss to follow-up rates. We propose that bloodspot-based genetic testing for GJB2 alleles can provide a means for rapid confirmation in a subset of infants who fail bedside newborn hearing screening. : We performed a case-control study comparing the prevalence of common GJB2 mutations from deidentified bloodspots designated as "refer" by newborn hearing screening and contemporaneously selected randomly chosen controls designated as "pass." Between March 2006 and December 2007, 2354 spots were analyzed for common alleles, c.35delG, c.167delT, c.235delC, and p.V37I in GJB2 with a subset reanalyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing to search for additional alleles. : The prevalence of biallelic GJB2 mutations in bloodspots from infants who referred by newborn hearing screening is approximately 1 in 50 (23/1177). In contrast, one bloodspot from an infant who passed newborn hearing screening was identified to harbor biallelic GJB2 mutations. : These findings show that when a newborn refers by newborn hearing screening, there is a significant chance that GJB2-related hearing loss is present. Bloodspot-based genetic testing for common GJB2 alleles should be considered as second tier testing for bedside newborn hearing screening.	4
p53 induces distinct epigenetic states at its direct target promoters. || Acetylation Cell Line Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Epigenesis, Genetic Genome, Human Histones Humans Mutation Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that is mutated in many cancers. Regulation of gene expression by binding of wild-type p53 to its target sites is accompanied by changes in epigenetic marks like histone acetylation. We studied DNA binding and epigenetic changes induced by wild-type and mutant p53 in non-malignant hTERT-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells overexpressing either wild-type p53 or one of four p53 mutants (R175H, R249S, R273H and R280K) on a wild-type p53 background. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to a 13,000 human promoter microarray, we found that wild-type p53 bound 197 promoters on the microarray including known and novel p53 targets. Of these p53 targets only 20% showed a concomitant increase in histone acetylation, which was linked to increased gene expression, while 80% of targets showed no changes in histone acetylation. We did not observe any decreases in histone acetylation in genes directly bound by wild-type p53. DNA binding in samples expressing mutant p53 was reduced over 95% relative to wild-type p53 and very few changes in histone acetylation and no changes in DNA methylation were observed in mutant p53 expressing samples. We conclude that wild-type p53 induces transcription of target genes by binding to DNA and differential induction of histone acetylation at target promoters. Several new wild-type p53 target genes, including DGKZ, FBXO22 and GDF9, were found. DNA binding of wild-type p53 is highly compromised if mutant p53 is present due to interaction of both p53 forms resulting in no direct effect on epigenetic marks.	0
APR-246 reactivates mutant p53 by targeting cysteines 124 and 277. ||  || The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated in human tumors by missense mutations in the DNA binding domain. TP53 mutations lead to protein unfolding, decreased thermostability and loss of DNA binding and transcription factor function. Pharmacological targeting of mutant p53 to restore its tumor suppressor function is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The mutant p53 reactivating compound APR-246 (PRIMA-1Met) has been successfully tested in a phase I/IIa clinical trial. APR-246 is converted to the reactive electrophile methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), which binds covalently to p53 core domain. We identified cysteine 277 as a prime binding target for MQ in p53. Cys277 is also essential for MQ-mediated thermostabilization of wild-type, R175H and R273H mutant p53, while both Cys124 and Cys277 are required for APR-246-mediated functional restoration of R175H mutant p53 in living tumor cells. These findings may open opportunities for rational design of novel mutant p53-targeting compounds.	0
Low BRAF and NRAS expression levels are associated with clinical benefit from DTIC therapy and prognosis in metastatic melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating Dacarbazine Disease-Free Survival Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Neoplasm Metastasis Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf RNA, Messenger || Metastatic melanoma is characterized by a poor response to chemotherapy. Furthermore, there is a lack of established predictive and prognostic markers. In this single institution study, we correlated mutation status and expression levels of BRAF and NRAS to dacarbazine (DTIC) treatment response as well as progression-free and overall survival in a cohort of 85 patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma. Neither BRAF nor NRAS mutation status correlated to treatment response. However, patients with tumors harboring NRAS mutations had a shorter overall survival (p < 0.001) compared to patients with tumors wild-type for NRAS. Patients having a clinical benefit (objective response or stable disease at 3 months) on DTIC therapy had lower BRAF and NRAS expression levels compared to patients progressing on therapy (p = 0.037 and 0.003, respectively). For BRAF expression, this association was stronger among patients with tumors wild-type for BRAF (p = 0.005). Further, low BRAF as well as NRAS expression levels were associated with a longer progression-free survival in the total population (p = 0.004 and <0.001, respectively). Contrasting low NRAS expression levels, which were associated with improved overall survival in the total population (p = 0.01), low BRAF levels were associated with improved overall survival only among patients with tumors wild-type for BRAF (p = 0.013). These findings indicate that BRAF and NRAS expression levels may influence responses to DTIC as well as prognosis in patients with advanced melanoma.	4
Cellular mechanisms of mutations in Kv7.1: auditory functions in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome vs. Romano-Ward syndrome. ||  || As a result of cell-specific functions of voltage-activated K(+) channels, such as Kv7.1, mutations in this channel produce profound cardiac and auditory defects. At the same time, the massive diversity of K(+) channels allows for compensatory substitution of mutant channels by other functional channels of their type to minimize defective phenotypes. Kv7.1 represents a clear example of such functional dichotomy. While several point mutations in the channel result in a cardio-auditory syndrome called Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), about 100-fold mutations result in long QT syndrome (LQTS) denoted as Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), which has an intact auditory phenotype. To determine whether the cellular mechanisms for the diverse phenotypic outcome of Kv7.1 mutations, are dependent on the tissue-specific function of the channel and/or specialized functions of the channel, we made series of point mutations in hKv7.1 ascribed to JLNS and RWS. For JLNS mutations, all except W248F yielded non-functional channels when expressed alone. Although W248F at the end of the S4 domain yielded a functional current, it underwent marked inactivation at positive voltages, rendering the channel non-functional. We demonstrate that by definition, none of the JLNS mutants operated in a dominant negative (DN) fashion. Instead, the JLNS mutants have impaired membrane trafficking, trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Cis-Golgi. The RWS mutants exhibited varied functional phenotypes. However, they can be summed up as exhibiting DN effects. Phenotypic differences between JLNS and RWS may stem from tissue-specific functional requirements of cardiac vs. inner ear non-sensory cells.	0
NRAS and BRAF mutations in melanoma-associated nevi and uninvolved nevi. || DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Association Studies Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Mutation Rate Nevus, Pigmented Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf || According to the prevailing multistep model of melanoma development, oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutations are crucial initial events in melanoma development. It is not known whether melanocytic nevi that are found in association with a melanoma are more likely to carry BRAF or NRAS mutations than uninvolved nevi. By laser microdissection we were able to selectively dissect and genotype cells either from the nevus or from the melanoma part of 46 melanomas that developed in association with a nevus. In 25 cases we also genotyped a control nevus of the same patients. Available tissue was also immunostained using the BRAF(V600E)-mutation specific antibody VE1. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 63.0% of melanomas, 65.2% of associated nevi and 50.0% of control nevi. No significant differences in the distribution of BRAF or NRAS mutations could be found between melanoma and associated nevi or between melanoma associated nevi and control nevi. In concordant cases immunohistochemistry showed a higher expression (intensity of immunohistochemistry) of the mutated BRAF(V600E)-protein in melanomas compared to their associated nevi. In this series the presence of a BRAF- or NRAS mutation in a nevus was not associated with the risk of malignant transformation. Our findings do not support the current traditional model of stepwise tumor progression.	4
Correlation between GJB2 mutations and audiological deficits: personal experience. || Acoustic Impedance Tests Adolescent Adult Aged Audiometry Auditory Threshold Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Bilateral Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Young Adult || Mutations in GJB2 gene are the most common cause of genetic deafness. More than 100 mutations have been described. The aim of this work is to describe the personal experience in genetic hearing loss, investigating the audiological and genetical characteristics of Cx26 deafness and correlating genotype and phenotype. We performed audiological and genetical evaluation in 154 patients affected by non-syndromic deafness of different degree. All patients showed a bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss. From the genetical analysis 127 probands resulted as negatives while 27 as positives (51.8% homozygous for 35 delG, 14.8% compound heterozygosis and 33.3% single mutation); 7.5% of patients had a mild deafness, 37% moderate, 33.3% severe and 22.2% profound. The c.35 delG mutation was detected in 66.6% of patients. Three mutations were found in compound heterozygosis with 35 delG, six different single mutations already described, and a new mutation S138G were also found. Correlation between genotype and phenotype confirmed the high variability of hearing loss.	4
p53-Reactivating small molecules induce apoptosis and enhance chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Blotting, Western Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Combined Modality Therapy Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor Female Furans Genetic Therapy Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans Imidazoles Male Piperazines Pyrimidines Quinuclidines Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We evaluate whether p53-reactivating (p53RA) small molecules induce p53-dependent apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a question that has not been previously addressed in head and neck cancer. PRIMA-1, CP-31398, RITA, and nutlin-3 were tested in four human HNSCC cell lines differing in TP53 status. Cell growth, viability, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis after treatment with p53RA small molecules individually or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents were assessed. Prominent p53 reactivation was observed in mutant TP53-bearing tumor cell lines treated with PRIMA-1 or CP-31398, and in wild-type TP53-bearing cell lines treated with nutlin-3. Cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by p53RA small molecules were associated with upregulation of p21 and BAX, and cleavage of caspase-3. Nutlin-3 showed maximal growth suppression in tumor cells showing MDM2-dependent p53 degradation. High-dose treatment with p53RA small molecules also induced apoptosis in cell lines independent of p53 or MDM2 expression. In combination therapy, p53RA small molecules enhanced the anti-tumor activity of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and erlotinib against HNSCC cells. The p53RA small molecules effectively restored p53 tumor-suppressive function in HNSCCs with mutant or wild-type TP53. The p53RA agents may be clinically useful against HNSCC, in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs.	0
Molecular subtype specific efficacy of MEK inhibitors in pancreatic cancers. || Cell Line, Tumor ErbB Receptors Genes, ras Humans MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms Protein Kinase Inhibitors Pyridones Pyrimidinones Signal Transduction || Pancreatic cancer is an increasing cause of cancer related death worldwide. KRAS is the dominant oncogene in this cancer type and molecular rationale would indicate, that inhibitors of the downstream target MEK could be appropriate targeted agents, but clinical trials have failed so far to achieve statistically significant benefit in unselected patients. We aimed to identify predictive molecular biomarkers that can help to define subgroups where MEK inhibitors might be beneficial alone or in combination. Next-generation sequencing data of 50 genes in three pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa2, BxPC3 and Panc1) were analyzed and compared to the molecular profile of 138 clinical pancreatic cancer samples to identify the molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer these cell lines represent. Luminescent cell viability assay was used to determine the sensitivity of cell lines to kinase inhibitors. Western blot was used to analyze the pathway activity of the examined cell lines. According to our cell viability and pathway activity data on these model cell lines only cells harboring the rare G12C KRAS mutation and low EGFR expression are sensitive to single MEK inhibitor (trametinib) treatment. The common G12D KRAS mutation leads to elevated baseline Akt activity, thus treatment with single MEK inhibitors fails. However, combination of MEK and Akt inhibitors are synergistic in this case. In case of wild-type KRAS and high EGFR expression MEK inhibitor induced Akt phosphorylation leads to trametinib resistance which necessitates for MEK and EGFR or Akt inhibitor combination treatment. In all we provide strong preclinical rational and possible molecular mechanism to revisit MEK inhibitor therapy in pancreatic cancer in both monotherapy and combination, based on molecular profile analysis of pancreatic cancer samples and cell lines. According to our most remarkable finding, a small subgroup of patients with G12C KRAS mutation may still benefit from MEK inhibitor monotherapy.	0
Novel mutation detection of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene, FGFR2IIIa, FGFR2IIIb, FGFR2IIIc, FGFR3, FGFR4 gene for craniosynostosis: A prospective study in Asian Indian patient. || Craniosynostosis fibroblast growth factor receptor genotypic phenotypic || Craniosynostosis (CS) syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition classically combining craniosynostosis and non-syndromic craniosynostosis with digital anomalies of the hands and feet. The majority of cases are caused by heterozygous mutations in the third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) of FGFR2, whilst a larger number of cases can be attributed to mutations outside this region of the protein. To find out the FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 gene in craniosynostosis syndrome. A hospital based prospective study. Prospective analysis of clinical records of patients registered in CS clinic from December 2007 to January 2015 was done in patients between 4 months to 13 years of age. We have performed genetic findings in a three generation Indian family with Craniosynostosis syndrome. We report for the first time the clinical and genetic findings in a three generation Indian family with Craniosynostosis syndrome caused by a heterozygous missense mutation, Thr 392 Thr and ser 311 try, located in the IgII domain of FGFR2. FGFR 3 and 4 gene basis syndrome was eponymously named. Genetic analysis demonstrated that 51/56 families to be unrelated.

Independent genetic origins, but phenotypic similarities in the 51 families add to the evidence supporting the theory of selfish spermatogonial selective advantage for this rare gain-of-function FGFR2 mutation.	4
Clinical and Mechanistic Insights Into the Genetics of Cardiomyopathy. || Cardiomyopathies Genetic Testing Genomics Humans Phenotype || Over the last quarter-century, there has been tremendous progress in genetics research that has defined molecular causes for cardiomyopathies. More than a thousand mutations have been identified in many genes with varying ontologies, therein indicating the diverse molecules and pathways that cause hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Translation of this research to the clinic via genetic testing can precisely group affected patients according to molecular etiology, and identify individuals without evidence of disease who are at high risk for developing cardiomyopathy. These advances provide insights into the earliest manifestations of cardiomyopathy and help to define the molecular pathophysiological basis for cardiac remodeling. Although these efforts remain incomplete, new genomic technologies and analytic strategies provide unparalleled opportunities to fully explore the genetic architecture of cardiomyopathies. Such data hold the promise that mutation-specific pathophysiology will uncover novel therapeutic targets, and herald the beginning of precision therapy for cardiomyopathy patients.	4
Clinical spectrum of woolly hair: indications for cerebral involvement. || Cardiomyopathies Child Child, Preschool Encephalitis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hair Diseases Humans Infant Italy Keratoderma, Palmoplantar Male Monitoring, Physiologic Prognosis Rare Diseases Risk Assessment Sampling Studies Severity of Illness Index Syndrome || Woolly Hair is an uncommon congenital anomaly of the scalp hair presenting with strongly coiled hair involving a localized area of the scalp or covering the entire side and occurring in non-black people. Isolated or localized wooly hair is usually benign and is not related to other disorders and/or complications. On the contrary, the generalized type may be related to disorders and syndromes affecting heart, cutis, liver and gastrointestinal organs. Among the syndromes presenting with wooly hair, the most known are the Naxos syndrome, the Carvajal-Huerta syndrome, the wooly hair/hypotrichosis, the ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility, the tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome. To our knowledge, no cases of wooly hair syndromes has been associated to neurologic involvement. Among the clinical notes of patients admitted in the Pediatric Units of the Catania University, we have selected four individuals presenting wooly hair, who showed different clinical features and course: case 1 presenting with a localized wooly hair type; case 2, member of a family affected by WH with autosomal dominant inheritance, not associated to complications; case 3, a wooly hair patient who displayed a progressive, severe form of Rasmussen's encephalitis with fatal evolution, and case 4, wooly hair associated to brain malformation and drug-resistant epilepsy. With this report, we aim to underline the wide spectrum of clinical presentation of individuals with WH and in particular we wish to give an annotation on a possible association of WH with severe neurologic disorders.	4
Tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness in phenylketonuria. Two new cases and a review of molecular genetic findings. ||  || We report two new patients with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-responsive phenylketonuria and compare their phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes (A395P/ IVS12+g>a and R261Q/165T, respectively) to those of previous cases from the literature. These case observations confirm earlier reports stating that BH4-responsive patients are frequently carriers of a missense mutation within the DNA region coding for the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Interestingly, many of the PAH gene mutations detected in BH4-responsive patients have been associated with an inconsistent phenotype in the past. Our case reports confirm that it is necessary to thoroughly examine individuals with increased phenylalanine levels, not only to detect BH4 deficiency, but also to identify patients with PAH deficiency who may benefit from BH4 treatment. In both of our patients, however, an effect of BH4 (7.5 mg/kg) on plasma phenylalanine levels was not seen in the newborn period. We therefore conclude that a normal neonatal BH4 test does not necessarily exclude BH4 responsiveness in all such patients.	1 3

[1996: Nat Genet 14:174-176] and the phenotype subsequently by Muenke et al. [1997: Am J Hum Genet 60:555-564], Reardon et al. [1997: J Med Genet 34:632-636], and Graham et al. [1998: Am J Med Genet 77:322-329]. These authors emphasized the pleiotropic nature of this form of coronal craniosynostosis, including brachydactyly with carpal and/or tarsal coalitions, with other anomalies at lower frequency. We report on a family with autosomal dominant coronal synostosis, segmentation and fusion anomalies of the vertebra and ribs, and Sprengel shoulder due to the Pro250Arg mutation. We also report a single case with an identical phenotype without the mutation.	4
Thyroid carcinoma-associated genetic mutations also occur in thyroid lymphomas. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Female Germinal Center Humans Immunophenotyping Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, Follicular Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse Male Middle Aged Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutation Oncogene Proteins, Fusion PAX8 Transcription Factor PPAR gamma Paired Box Transcription Factors Pennsylvania Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Survival Rate Thyroid Neoplasms Transcription Factors Translocation, Genetic ras Proteins || Molecular testing for mutations activating the mitogen-associated protein kinase signaling pathway is being used to help diagnose thyroid carcinomas. However, the prevalence of these mutations in thyroid lymphomas has not been reported. Therefore, we studied the prevalence of BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS mutations in 33 thyroid lymphomas and correlated the mutational status with the clinical, pathological, cytogenetic, and immunophenotypic findings. Eleven cases were also tested for PAX8/PPARγ translocations. The lymphomas included 25 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 6 extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, and 2 follicular lymphomas. Seventeen diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were germinal center type, six non-germinal center type, and two unclassifiable (Hans algorithm). None of the cases had an associated thyroid carcinoma. Mutations of the BRAF gene were identified in six (24%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (D594G in three germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, K601N in two germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and V600E in one non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and of the NRAS gene in two (8%) non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (Q61K and Q61H). BRAF and NRAS mutations were not found in any extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type or follicular lymphomas. HRAS and KRAS mutations were not identified in any of the cases, nor were PAX8/PPARγ translocations found. Thus, interpretation of finding a BRAF or NRAS mutation in the thyroid, particularly in preoperative thyroid aspirates, must take into account the differential diagnosis of a lymphoma. In addition to the diagnostic importance, our data also demonstrate that alteration in the mitogen-associated protein kinase pathway may have a role in the pathogenesis of some large B-cell lymphomas of the thyroid with potential therapeutic implications.	4
p53 inactivation upregulates p73 expression through E2F-1 mediated transcription. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 DNA-Binding Proteins E2F1 Transcription Factor Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans MCF-7 Cells Mutation Nuclear Proteins Plasmids Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA, Small Interfering Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins Up-Regulation || While p73 overexpression has been associated with increased apoptosis in cancer tissues, p73 overexpressing tumors appear to be of high grade malignancy. Why this putative tumor suppressor is overexpressed in cancer cells and what the function of overexpressed p73 is in breast cancers are critical questions to be addressed. By investigating the effect of p53 inactivation on p73 expression, we found that both protein and mRNA levels of TAp73 were increased in MCF-7/p53siRNA cells, MCF-7/p53mt135 cells and HCT-116/p53-/- cells, as compared to wild type control, suggesting that p53 inactivation by various forms upregulates p73. We showed that p53 knockdown induced p73 was mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. However, although p53 has a putative binding site in the TAp73 promoter, deletion of this binding site did not affect p53 knockdown mediated activation of TAp73 promoter. Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) data demonstrated that loss of p53 results in enhanced occupancy of E2F-1 in the TAp73 promoter. The responsive sequence of p53 inactivation mediated p73 upregulation was mapped to the proximal promoter region of the TAp73 gene. To test the role of E2F-1 in p53 inactivation mediated regulation of p73 transcription, we found that p53 knockdown enhanced E2F-1 dependent p73 transcription, and mutations in E2F-1 binding sites in the TAp73 promoter abrogated p53 knockdown mediated activation of TAp73 promoter. Moreover, we demonstrated that p21 is a mediator of p53-E2F crosstalk in the regulation of p73 transcription. We concluded that p53 knockdown/inactivation may upregulate TAp73 expression through E2F-1 mediated transcriptional regulation. p53 inactivation mediated upregulation of p73 suggests an intrinsic rescuing mechanism in response to p53 mutation/inactivation. These findings support further analysis of the correlation between p53 status and p73 expression and its prognostic/predictive significance in human cancers.	0
Utility of different massive parallel sequencing platforms for mutation profiling in clinical samples and identification of pitfalls using FFPE tissue. || Biopsy Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung DNA Mutational Analysis ErbB Receptors Germany High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Mutation Precision Medicine || In the growing field of personalised medicine, the analysis of numerous potential targets is becoming a challenge in terms of work load, tissue availability, as well as costs. The molecular analysis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has shifted from the analysis of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status to the analysis of different gene regions, including resistance mutations or translocations. Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) allows rapid comprehensive mutation testing in routine molecular pathological diagnostics even on small formalin-fixed, paraffin‑embedded (FFPE) biopsies. In this study, we compared and evaluated currently used MPS platforms for their application in routine pathological diagnostics. We initiated a first round‑robin testing of 30 cases diagnosed with NSCLC and a known EGFR gene mutation status. In this study, three pathology institutes from Germany received FFPE tumour sections that had been individually processed. Fragment libraries were prepared by targeted multiplex PCR using institution‑specific gene panels. Sequencing was carried out using three MPS systems: MiSeq™, GS Junior and PGM Ion Torrent™. In two institutes, data analysis was performed with the platform-specific software and the Integrative Genomics Viewer. In one institute, data analysis was carried out using an in-house software system. Of 30 samples, 26 were analysed by all institutes. Concerning the EGFR mutation status, concordance was found in 26 out of 26 samples. The analysis of a few samples failed due to poor DNA quality in alternating institutes. We found 100% concordance when comparing the results of the EGFR mutation status. A total of 38 additional mutations were identified in the 26 samples. In two samples, minor variants were found which could not be confirmed by qPCR. Other characteristic variants were identified as fixation artefacts by reanalyzing the respective sample by Sanger sequencing. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated good concordance in the detection of mutations using different MPS platforms. The failure with samples can be traced back to different DNA extraction systems and DNA quality. Unknown or ambiguous variations (transitions) need verification with another method, such as qPCR or Sanger sequencing.	4
Genetic Variations Leading to Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy. || Animals Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Humans || Cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death worldwide. Based on pathohistological abnormalities and clinical manifestation, cardiomyopathies are categorized into several groups: hypertrophic, dilated, restricted, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, and unclassified. Dilated cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by dilation of the left ventricle and systolic dysfunction, is the most severe and prevalent form of cardiomyopathy and usually requires heart transplantation. Its etiology remains unclear. Recent genetic studies of single gene mutations have provided significant insights into the complex processes of cardiac dysfunction. To date, over 40 genes have been demonstrated to contribute to dilated cardiomyopathy. With advances in genetic screening techniques, novel genes associated with this disease are continuously being identified. The respective gene products can be classified into several functional groups such as sarcomere proteins, structural proteins, ion channels, and nuclear envelope proteins. Nuclear envelope proteins are emerging as potential molecular targets in dilated cardiomyopathy. Because they are not directly associated with contractile force generation and transmission, the molecular pathways through which these proteins cause cardiac muscle disorder remain unclear. However, nuclear envelope proteins are involved in many essential cellular processes. Therefore, integrating apparently distinct cellular processes is of great interest in elucidating the etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy. In this mini review, we summarize the genetic factors associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and discuss their cellular functions.	4
Hearing in adults with Pompe disease. ||  || Hearing loss has been recognized as an important cause of morbidity in infants with Pompe disease, a metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of acid α-glucosidase. It is unknown whether hearing is also affected in adult Pompe patients. We have studied the prevalence, severity, and type of hearing loss in 58 adult patients using tympanometry and pure-tone audiometry. Compared to normative data (International Organisation for Standardisation standard 7029), 72% of patients had impaired hearing thresholds at one or more frequencies in at least one ear. All measured frequencies were equally affected. All patients had a sensorineural type of hearing loss, pointing to cochlear or retrocochlear pathology. Categorised according to the standards of the World Health Organisation 21% of patients had a clinically relevant hearing loss (16% slight, 3% moderate, 2% profound). Though this suggests that hearing loss occurs in a considerable number of patients with Pompe disease, this prevalence is similar to that in the general population. Therefore, we conclude that hearing loss is not a specific feature of Pompe disease in adults.	1
Synchronous Independent Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas in Struma Ovarii and the Thyroid Gland With Different RAS Mutations. ||  || Struma ovarii is a rare ovarian teratoma predominantly composed of thyroid tissue. The simultaneous presence of thyroid carcinoma in the struma ovarii and the thyroid gland is extremely rare. It remains unclear if these carcinomas represent independent primary tumors and whether the molecular mechanisms of the tumors developing in the thyroid and ovarian tissues are similar. We present the case of a patient with two independent papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) in struma ovarii and the thyroid gland that are driven by different RAS mutations. A 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma was diagnosed with a pelvic mass during a CT scan. She had surgery that included removal of her ovaries. A 7.2-cm classical variant of PTC arising in a struma ovarii was identified in the right ovary. Two months after the pelvic surgery, total thyroidectomy was performed, and a small nodule (0.8 cm) in the left lobe was diagnosed as a classical variant of PTC. Molecular analysis of tissues obtained from both the malignant struma ovarii and thyroid gland was performed.RAS mutations both in the PTC located in the thyroid and ovarian tissues were identified. However, whereas the thyroid gland tumor showed anHRAS Q61R mutation, the PTC in struma ovarii harbored anNRAS Q61R mutation. In this case, the finding of distinct types ofRAS point mutation in thyroid cancers at two different locations provides definitive evidence that these cancers are synchronously developed independent primary tumors.	4
Dysregulation of cell cycle control caused by overexpression of the oncogene pp32r1 (ANP32C) and the Tyr>His mutant pp32r1Y140H. || Autoantigens Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Nucleus Cell Proliferation Cyclin D1 Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, Tumor Suppressor HeLa Cells Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex Mutant Proteins Nuclear Proteins Oncogenes Phosphoproteins Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The pp32 (ANP32A) gene acts as a tumor suppressor while its closely related homologue pp32r1 (ANP32C) is oncogenic and is overexpressed in breast, prostate and pancreatic tumors. The transduction of p53wt cell lines (ACHN and HeLa) with pp32r1 or pp32r1Y140H lentivirus increased the proliferation of p53wt cell lines compared to the untransduced control cells while transduction of the p53(R248W) MiaPaCa2 cell line had no effect. Cell cycle analysis of transduced ACHN cells by PI staining and BrdU incorporation illustrated a pronounced shift toward the S-phase of the cell cycle in cells overexpressing the pp32r1 and pp32r1Y140H proteins. Confocal microscopy and western blotting demonstrated that pp32r1 and the pp32r1Y140H mutant protein reside predominantly in the cytoplasm in constrast to pp32 which is a nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling protein. To determine the effects of pp32r1 or pp32r1Y140H overexpression at the proteomic level we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis on ACHN, ACHN-pp32r1 and ACHN-pp32r1Y140H cell lysates using the isotope-coded protein label (ICPL) method. Among those proteins with >40% regulation were Macrophage Capping protein (CAPG) and Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) proteins which were significantly upregulated by pp32r1 and pp32r1Y140H overexpression. This increase in CHD4 also appears to influence a number of cell cycle regulator genes including; p53, p21 and cyclinD1 as judged by western blotting. Silencing of CHD4 in ACHN-pp32r1Y140H cells using specific shRNA reverted the cell cycle dysregulation caused by pp32r1Y140H expression to that of the untransduced ACHN cell line, suggesting that CHD4 is the prominent effector of the pp32r1/pp32r1Y140H phenotype.	0
Comprehensive profiling and quantitation of oncogenic mutations in non small-cell lung carcinoma using single molecule amplification and re-sequencing technology. || Aged Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung DNA Mutational Analysis Decision Support Systems, Clinical ErbB Receptors Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Reproducibility of Results Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA Treatment Outcome Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Activating and resistance mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of several oncogenes are frequently associated with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In this study we assessed the frequency, type and abundance of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, TP53 and ALK mutations in tumour specimens from 184 patients with early and late stage disease using single molecule amplification and re-sequencing technology (SMART). Based on modelling of EGFR mutations, the detection sensitivity of the SMART assay was at least 0.1%. Benchmarking EGFR mutation detection against the gold standard ARMS-PCR assay, SMART assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 98.7% and 99.0%. Amongst the 184 samples, EGFR mutations were the most prevalent (59.9%), followed by KRAS (16.9%), TP53 (12.7%), EML4-ALK fusions (6.3%) and BRAF (4.2%) mutations. The abundance and types of mutations in tumour specimens were extremely heterogeneous, involving either monoclonal (51.6%) or polyclonal (12.6%) mutation events. At the clinical level, although the spectrum of tumour mutation(s) was unique to each patient, the overall patterns in early or advanced stage disease were relatively similar. Based on these findings, we propose that personalized profiling and quantitation of clinically significant oncogenic mutations will allow better classification of patients according to tumour characteristics and provide clinicians with important ancillary information for treatment decision-making.	4
Carrier re-sequencing reveals rare but benign variants in recessive deafness genes. ||  || For recessive Mendelian disorders, determining the pathogenicity of rare, non-synonymous variants in known causative genes can be challenging without expanded pedigrees and/or functional analysis. In this study, we proposed to establish a database of rare but benign variants in recessive deafness genes by systematic carrier re-sequencing. As a pilot study, 30 heterozygous carriers of pathogenic variants for deafness were identified from unaffected family members of 18 deaf probands. The entire coding regions of the corresponding genes were re-sequenced in those carriers by targeted next-generation sequencing or Sanger sequencing. A total of 32 non-synonymous variants were identified in the normal-hearing carriers in trans with the pathogenic variant and therefore were classified as benign. Among them were five rare (minor allele frequencies less than 0.005) variants that had previously undefined, disputable or even misclassified function: p.A434T (c.1300 G > A) in SLC26A4, p.R266Q (c.797 G > A) in LOXHD1, p.K96Q (c.286 A > C) in MYO15A, p.T123N (c.368 C > A) in GJB2 and p.V1299I (c.797 G > A) in CDH23. Our results suggested that large scale carrier re-sequencing may be warranted to establish a database of rare but benign variants in causative genes in order to reduce false positive genetic diagnosis of recessive Mendelian disorders.	4
Splicing function of mitotic regulators links R-loop-mediated DNA damage to tumor cell killing. || Animals Apoptosis Biomarkers Blotting, Western Cell Cycle Proteins Cellular Senescence DNA Damage Drosophila melanogaster Fibroblasts Fluorescent Antibody Technique High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunoprecipitation Microtubule-Associated Proteins Mitosis Neoplasms Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins RNA Splicing RNA, Messenger Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Although studies suggest that perturbing mitotic progression leads to DNA damage and p53 activation, which in turn lead to either cell apoptosis or senescence, it remains unclear how mitotic defects trigger p53 activation. We show that BuGZ and Bub3, which are two mitotic regulators localized in the interphase nucleus, interact with the splicing machinery and are required for pre-mRNA splicing. Similar to inhibition of RNA splicing by pladienolide B, depletion of either BuGZ or Bub3 led to increased formation of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops), which led to DNA damage and p53 activation in both human tumor cells and primary cells. Thus, R-loop-mediated DNA damage and p53 activation offer a mechanistic explanation for apoptosis of cancer cells and senescence of primary cells upon disruption of the dual-function mitotic regulators. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the full range of functions of mitotic regulators to develop antitumor drugs.	0
Beta-myosin heavy-chain mutations R403QLW, V606M, K615N and R663H in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ||  || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease of the myocardium with an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance mainly caused by single heterozygous mutations in sarcomere genes. In this study we aimed to detect the presence of R403QLW, V606M, K615N, and R663H mutations in beta-myosin heavy-chain gene (MYH7) and figure out the genotype-phenotype correlations in Turkish patients with HCM. This case-control study based on genotype-phenotype correlation included 69 patients (mean age, years: 50±13.16) diagnosed with HCM constituting the study group and 50 healthy individuals (mean age, years: 52±1.4) constituting the control group. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and the genotyping of mutations was performed by real-time PCR technique and high resolution melting analysis. Associations between categoric variables were determined using chi-square tests. Differences between two groups were compared with unpaired Student's t-test for continuous variables. None of the patients in the HCM group were carrying the index mutations. One healthy individual was found to be heterozygous for the R663H mutation with mildly abnormal IVS and LVPW thickness. The allele frequency for R663H (G>A) mutation was found to be 0.01% in control group. We performed a mutational screening of 6 HCM-associated mutations in 69 Turkish HCM patients (not previously studied except R403Q). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of the mutations between the patients with HCM and the healthy controls (p>0.05).	4
NRAS (Q61R), BRAF (V600E) immunohistochemistry: a concomitant tool for mutation screening in melanomas. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Female GTP Phosphohydrolases High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Polymerase Chain Reaction Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Young Adult || The determination of NRAS and BRAF mutation status is a major requirement in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. Mutation specific antibodies against NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins could offer additional data on tumor heterogeneity. The specificity and sensitivity of NRAS(Q61R) immunohistochemistry have recently been reported excellent. We aimed to determine the utility of immunohistochemistry using SP174 anti-NRAS(Q61R) and VE1 anti-BRAF(V600E) antibodies in the theranostic mutation screening of melanomas. 142 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanoma samples from 79 patients were analyzed using pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry. 23 and 26 patients were concluded to have a NRAS-mutated or a BRAF-mutated melanoma respectively. The 23 NRAS (Q61R) and 23 BRAF (V600E) -mutant samples with pyrosequencing were all positive in immunohistochemistry with SP174 antibody and VE1 antibody respectively, without any false negative. Proportions and intensities of staining were varied. Other NRAS (Q61L) , NRAS (Q61K) , BRAF (V600K) and BRAF (V600R) mutants were negative in immunohistochemistry. 6 single cases were immunostained but identified as wild-type using pyrosequencing (1 with SP174 and 5 with VE1). 4/38 patients with multiple samples presented molecular discordant data. Technical limitations are discussed to explain those discrepancies. Anyway we could not rule out real tumor heterogeneity. In our study, we showed that combining immunohistochemistry analysis targeting NRAS(Q61R) and BRAF(V600E) proteins with molecular analysis was a reliable theranostic tool to face challenging samples of melanoma.	4
High carrier frequency of the 35delG deafness mutation in European populations. Genetic Analysis Consortium of GJB2 35delG. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Europe Female Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Male Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Sequence Deletion || Congenital deafness accounts for about 1 in 1000 infants and approximately 80% of cases are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Recently, it has been demonstrated that connexin 26 (GJB2) gene is a major gene for congenital sensorineural deafness. A single mutation (named 35delG) was found in most recessive families and sporadic cases of congenital deafness, among Caucasoids, with relative frequencies ranging from 28% to 63%. We present here the analysis of the 35delG mutation in 3270 random controls from 17 European countries. We have detected a carrier frequency for 35delG of 1 in 35 in southern Europe and 1 in 79 in central and northern Europe. In addition, 35delG was detected in five out of 376 Jewish subjects of different origin, but was absent in other non-European populations. The study suggests either a single origin for 35delG somewhere in Europe or in the Middle East, and the possible presence of a carrier advantage together with a founder effect. The 35delG carrier frequency of 1 in 51 in the overall European population clearly indicates that this genetic alteration is a major mutation for autosomal recessive deafness in Caucasoids. This finding should facilitate diagnosis of congenital deafness and allow early treatment of the affected subjects.	4
CEA/CD3 bispecific antibody MEDI-565/AMG 211 activation of T cells and subsequent killing of human tumors is independent of mutations commonly found in colorectal adenocarcinomas. || Adenocarcinoma Animals Antibodies, Bispecific CD3 Complex CHO Cells Carcinoembryonic Antigen Cell Line, Tumor Cells, Cultured Colorectal Neoplasms Cricetinae Cricetulus Cytotoxicity, Immunologic Female HT29 Cells HeLa Cells Humans Lymphocyte Activation Male Mice, SCID Mutation Neoplasms Protein Binding T-Lymphocytes Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Individual or combinations of somatic mutations found in genes from colorectal cancers can redirect the effects of chemotherapy and targeted agents on cancer cell survival and, consequently, on clinical outcome. Novel therapeutics with mechanisms of action that are independent of mutational status would therefore fulfill a current unmet clinical need. Here the CEA and CD3 bispecific single-chain antibody MEDI-565 (also known as MT111 and AMG 211) was evaluated for its ability to activate T cells both in vitro and in vivo and to kill human tumor cell lines harboring various somatic mutations commonly found in colorectal cancers. MEDI-565 specifically bound to normal and malignant tissues in a CEA-specific manner, and only killed CEA positive cells. The BiTE® antibody construct mediated T cell-directed killing of CEA positive tumor cells within 6 hours, at low effector-to-target ratios which were independent of high concentrations of soluble CEA. The potency of in vitro lysis was dependent on CEA antigen density but independent of the mutational status in cancer cell lines. Importantly, individual or combinations of mutated KRAS and BRAF oncogenes, activating PI3KCA mutations, loss of PTEN expression, and loss-of-function mutations in TP53 did not reduce the activity in vitro. MEDI-565 also prevented growth of human xenograft tumors which harbored various mutations. These findings suggest that MEDI-565 represents a potential treatment option for patients with CEA positive tumors of diverse origin, including those with individual or combinations of somatic mutations that may be less responsive to chemotherapy and other targeted agents.	0
A mutation in the beta-myosin rod associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has an unexpected molecular phenotype. || Amino Acid Substitution Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Glutamic Acid Humans Lysine Mutation Phenotype Protein Stability Protein Structure, Secondary Thermodynamics Ventricular Myosins || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common, autosomal dominant disorder primarily characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy and is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in youth. HCM is caused by mutations in several sarcomeric proteins, with mutations in MYH7, encoding beta-MyHC, being the most common. While many mutations in the globular head region of the protein have been reported and studied, analysis of HCM-causing mutations in the beta-MyHC rod domain has not yet been reported. To address this question, we performed an array of biochemical and biophysical assays to determine how the HCM-causing E1356K mutation affects the structure, stability, and function of the beta-MyHC rod. Surprisingly, the E1356K mutation appears to thermodynamically destabilize the protein, rather than alter the charge profile know to be essential for muscle filament assembly. This thermodynamic instability appears to be responsible for the decreased ability of the protein to form filaments and may be responsible for the HCM phenotype seen in patients.	4
Genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: advances and pitfalls in molecular diagnosis and therapy. ||  || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary disease of the cardiac muscle that occurs mainly due to mutations (>1,400 variants) in genes encoding for the cardiac sarcomere. HCM, the most common familial form of cardiomyopathy, affecting one in every 500 people in the general population, is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and presents variable expressivity and age-related penetrance. Due to the morphological and pathological heterogeneity of the disease, the appearance and progression of symptoms is not straightforward. Most HCM patients are asymptomatic, but up to 25% develop significant symptoms, including chest pain and sudden cardiac death. Sudden cardiac death is a dramatic event, since it occurs without warning and mainly in younger people, including trained athletes. Molecular diagnosis of HCM is of the outmost importance, since it may allow detection of subjects carrying mutations on HCM-associated genes before development of clinical symptoms of HCM. However, due to the genetic heterogeneity of HCM, molecular diagnosis is difficult. Currently, there are mainly four techniques used for molecular diagnosis of HCM, including Sanger sequencing, high resolution melting, mutation detection using DNA arrays, and next-generation sequencing techniques. Application of these methods has proven successful for identification of mutations on HCM-related genes. This review summarizes the features of these technologies, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, current therapeutics for HCM patients are correlated with clinically observed phenotypes and are based on the alleviation of symptoms. This is mainly due to insufficient knowledge on the mechanisms involved in the onset of HCM. Tissue engineering alongside regenerative medicine coupled with nanotherapeutics may allow fulfillment of those gaps, together with screening of novel therapeutic drugs and target delivery systems.	4
Prevalence of c.35delG and p.M34T mutations in the GJB2 gene in Estonia. || Adolescent Age of Onset Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Estonia Europe Genetics, Population Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Mutation Sequence Deletion || The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of c.35delG and p.M34T mutations in the GJB2 gene among children with early onset hearing loss and within a general population of Estonia. Using an arrayed primer extension assay, we screened 233 probands with early childhood onset hearing loss for 107 different mutations in the GJB2 gene. We then looked for the two most common mutations, c.35delG and p.M34T, in a population of 998 consecutively born Estonian neonates to determine the frequency of these mutations in the general population. In 115 (49%) of the patients with early onset hearing loss, we found a mutation in at least one allele of the GJB2 gene. Seventy-three (31%) were homozygous for the c.35delG mutation, seven (3%) were homozygous for the p.M34T mutation, and five (2%) had c35delG/p.M34T compound heterozygosity. Other six identified mutations in GJB2 gene occurred rarely. Among the 998 anonymous newborn samples, we detected 45 who were heterozygous for c.35delG, 2 individuals homozygous for c.35delG, and 58 who were heterozygous for p.M34T. Additionally, we detected two c.35delG/p.M34T compound heterozygotes. The most common GJB2 gene mutations in Estonian children with early onset hearing loss were c.35delG and p.M34T, with c.35delG accounting for 75% of GJB2 alleles. The carrier frequency for c.35delG and p.M34T in a general population of Estonia was 1 in 22 and 1 in 17, respectively, and was higher than in most other countries.	4
Next-Generation Sequencing Approach to Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Yields More Actionable Alterations. || Adult Aged Algorithms Antineoplastic Agents Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged Patient Selection Protein Kinase Inhibitors || - Different testing algorithms and platforms for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements in advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma exist. The multistep approach with single-gene assays has been challenged by more efficient next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a large number of gene alterations. The main criticism of the NGS approach is the detection of genomic alterations of uncertain significance. - To determine the best testing algorithm for patients with lung cancer in our clinical practice. - Two testing approaches for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma were offered between 2012-2015. One approach was reflex testing for an 8-gene panel composed of DNA Sanger sequencing for EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF and fluorescence in situ hybridization for ALK, ROS1, MET, and RET. At the oncologist's request, a subset of tumors tested by the 8-gene panel was subjected to a 50-gene Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel. - Of 1200 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), 57 including 46 adenocarcinomas and NSCLCs, not otherwise specified; 7 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs); and 4 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs) were subjected to Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel. Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel detected 9 potentially actionable variants in 29 adenocarcinomas that were wild type by the 8-gene panel testing (9 of 29, 31.0%) in the following genes: ERBB2 (3 of 29, 10.3%), STK11 (2 of 29, 6.8%), PTEN (2 of 29, 6.8%), FBXW7 (1 of 29, 3.4%), and BRAF G469A (1 of 29, 3.4%). Four SCCs and 2 LCNECs showed investigational genomic alterations. - The NGS approach would result in the identification of a significant number of actionable gene alterations, increasing the therapeutic options for patients with advanced NSCLCs.	4
Correlation of BRAF and NRAS mutation status with outcome, site of distant metastasis and response to chemotherapy in metastatic melanoma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cohort Studies Disease-Free Survival Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Melanoma Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Treatment Outcome Young Adult || The prognostic significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in metastatic melanoma patients remains uncertain, with several studies reporting conflicting results, often biased by the inclusion of patients treated with BRAF and MEK (MAPK) inhibitors. We therefore interrogated a historical cohort of patients free of the confounding influence of MAPK inhibitor therapy. Patients with available archival tissue first diagnosed with metastatic melanoma between 2002 and 2006 were analysed. Mutational analysis was performed using the OncoCarta Panel. Patient characteristics, treatment outcome and survival were correlated with BRAF/NRAS mutation status. In 193 patients, 92 (48%) melanomas were BRAF-mutant, 39 (20%) were NRAS-mutant and 62 (32%) were wild-type for BRAF/NRAS mutations (wt). There was no difference in response to chemotherapy based on mutation status (35-37%). The distant disease-free interval (DDFI) was significantly shorter in patients with wt melanoma (27.9 months vs 35.1 for BRAF and 49.1 for NRAS) although this was not significant in multivariate analysis. Survival from stage IV melanoma diagnosis was not significantly different based on mutation status. The DDFI was significantly shorter in patients with BRAF(V600K/R) versus BRAF(V600E) melanoma in univariate and multivariate analyses. BRAF and NRAS mutation status does not influence survival in metastatic melanoma.	4
Connexinopathies: a structural and functional glimpse. || Animals Channelopathies Connexins Gap Junctions Humans Ion Channel Gating Models, Molecular Mutation || Mutations in human connexin (Cx) genes have been related to diseases, which we termed connexinopathies. Such hereditary disorders include nonsyndromic or syndromic deafness (Cx26, Cx30), Charcot Marie Tooth disease (Cx32), occulodentodigital dysplasia and cardiopathies (Cx43), and cataracts (Cx46, Cx50). Despite the clinical phenotypes of connexinopathies have been well documented, their pathogenic molecular determinants remain elusive. The purpose of this work is to identify common/uncommon patterns in channels function among Cx mutations linked to human diseases. To this end, we compiled and discussed the effect of mutations associated to Cx26, Cx32, Cx43, and Cx50 over gap junction channels and hemichannels, highlighting the function of the structural channel domains in which mutations are located and their possible role affecting oligomerization, gating and perm/selectivity processes.	0
Evidence for a latent precursor (p53 signature) that may precede serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous Endometrial Neoplasms Female Histones Humans Immunohistochemistry Ki-67 Antigen Middle Aged Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polyps Precancerous Conditions Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Both serous intraepithelial carcinoma and endometrial glandular dysplasia are associated with uterine serous carcinoma. Recently a candidate serous cancer precursor containing p53 mutations (p53 signature) was described in the fallopian tube. We analyzed normal and neoplastic endometrium for a similar entity. In total 10 endometrial polyps involved by intraepithelial and/or invasive carcinoma and 137 benign polyps were studied. All were stained for p53 and MIB-1. A subset of p53 signatures and carcinomas were analyzed for gamma-H2AX and p53 mutations. p53 signatures were identified in 7 of 10 cases intraepithelial carcinoma and were multicentric in 2. In one case, the signature was in continuity with intraepithelial carcinoma. Of 137 benign polyps (4%), 6 contained p53 signatures. The MIB-1 fraction in most signatures was less than 5%, and ranged from 50 to 90% in carcinomas. DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) was demonstrated in both p53 signatures and adjacent carcinomas but not in benign polyps. Shared identical p53 mutations were found in paired signatures and carcinomas in two of three cases analyzed, including one case with multiple signatures. In one, a coexistent invasive serous cancer was not found to contain a p53 mutation. In a third, a p53 signature and an invasive cancer harbored two different p53 mutations. This is the first description of p53 signatures adjacent to carcinoma, suggesting a role for this entity in the genesis of serous malignancy. The significance of p53 signatures in benign conditions (polyps) remains to be determined. The role of the p53 signature in early serous neoplasia is discussed.	4
Does Otovestibular Loss in the Autosomal Dominant Disorder DFNA9 Have an Impact of on Cognition? A Systematic Review. ||  || Background and Purpose: Cognitive impairment has been observed in patients with bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) and in patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). DFNA9 is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes a combination of both sensory deficits by the 3rd to 5th decade. We therefore hypothesize a combined detrimental effect on cognition. The aim of this systematic review was to identify studies related to DFNA9 in general and its relationship with cognitive impairment more specifically.Materials and Methods: Several databases including Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Web of Science were searched to accumulate information about DFNA9-mutations, including phenotype, genotype, pathophysiology, quality of life (QOL), and imaging in general and cognitive function more specifically. A qualitative analysis was performed on the 55 articles that qualified.Results: The clinical features of DFNA9 are different along the 24 COCH mutations, described up to now. Vestibular symptoms generally present themselves a few years after SNHL onset in mutations associated with the vWFA-domain although they can precede SNHL onset in other mutations associated with the LCCL-domain. QoL has not been studied extensively in DFNA9, although scarce work is available on the positive impact of cochlear implantation to rehabilitate hearing. No studies were found evaluating cognition in DFNA9 patients.Conclusion: Although cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in patients with hearing loss as well as in patients with BVL, no studies have been reported on the combination of both sensory deficits, such as in DFNA9. Further research is warranted to correlate otovestibular status with cognition.	4
The role of alternative GJB2 transcription in screening for neonatal sensorineural deafness in Austria. || Alternative Splicing Austria Base Sequence Case-Control Studies Connexins Exons Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans Mass Screening Polymorphism, Genetic || Alterations within a novel putative Exon 1a within the gap junction beta 2 (GJB2) gene may play a role in the development of genetic hearing impairment in Austria. Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of hereditary sensorineural deafness. Genome-wide screening for alternative transcriptional start sites in the human genome has revealed the presence of an additional GJB2 exon (E1a). This study tested the hypothesis of whether alternative GJB2 transcription involving E1a may play a role in the development of congenital sensorineural deafness in Austria. GJB2 E1a and flanking regions were sequenced in randomized normal hearing control subjects and three different patient groups with non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI), and bioinformatic analysis was performed. Statistical analysis of disease association was carried out using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. A single change 2410 bp proximal to the translational start site (c.-2410T > C, rs7994748, NM_004004.5:c.-23 + 792T > C) was found to be significantly associated with the common c.35delG GJB2 mutation (p = .009). c.35delG in combination with c.-2410CC occurred at a 6.9-fold increased frequency compared to the control group. Additionally, one patient with idiopathic congenital hearing loss was found to be homozygous c.-2410CC.	4
Early-onset diffuse gastric cancer associated with a de novo large genomic deletion of CDH1 gene. || Adult Anastomosis, Roux-en-Y Antigens, CD Cadherins Carcinoma, Signet Ring Cell Gastrectomy Gene Deletion Humans Male Mutation Stomach Neoplasms || A 41-year-old man with no familial history of gastric cancer was diagnosed as with intramucosal early gastric cancer. Two months after the first endoscopic submucosal dissection for signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC), the appearance of previously unrecognized multiple erosions of SRCC was noticed. Pathological examination after a total gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction with D2 lymph node dissection were performed. Postoperative pathological examination revealed 90 and more lesions, which tempted the attending pathologist to refer to genetic tests for the predisposition though the patient had no familial history of gastric cancer. There were no mutations in all the exons of CDH1 with conventional DNA sequencing, but multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses disclosed a large genomic deletion (c.1566-?_1711+?del), leading to the mRNA with loss of the exon 11. Among family members, his son was found to be a carrier of this change, while his parents were negative for the familial CDH1 mutation, implying that this change is a de novo event in the proband. The present report is the first description of a de novo large genomic deletion of CDH1 gene associated with early-onset diffuse gastric cancer. When the clinician finds a relatively-young patient who has multiple SRCCs, CDH1 germline mutation should be considered, even for patients with no familial history.	4
Splicing of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) exon 11 is vulnerable: molecular pathology of mutations in PAH exon 11. || Alternative Splicing Animals Base Sequence Cell Line Chromatography, Affinity Entropy Exons Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutagenesis Mutation Nuclear Proteins Pathology, Molecular Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias RNA Precursors RNA Splice Sites RNA-Binding Proteins Reproducibility of Results Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors Transfection || In about 20-30% of phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, phenylalanine (Phe) levels can be controlled by cofactor 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) administration. The phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotype has a predictive value concerning BH(4)-response and therefore a correct assessment of the mutation molecular pathology is important. Mutations that disturb the splicing of exons (e.g. interplay between splice site strength and regulatory sequences like exon splicing enhancers (ESEs)/exon splicing silencers (ESSs)) may cause different severity of PKU. In this study, we identified PAH exon 11 as a vulnerable exon and used patient derived lymphoblast cell lines and PAH minigenes to study the molecular defect that impacted pre-mRNA processing. We showed that the c.1144T>C and c.1066-3C>T mutations cause exon 11 skipping, while the c.1139C>T mutation is neutral or slightly beneficial. The c.1144T>C mutation resides in a putative splicing enhancer motif and binding by splicing factors SF2/ASF, SRp20 and SRp40 is disturbed. Additional mutations in potential splicing factor binding sites contributed to elucidate the pathogenesis of mutations in PAH exon 11. We suggest that PAH exon 11 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site and that this makes exon 11 inclusion dependent on an ESE spanning position c.1144. Importantly, this implies that other mutations in exon 11 may affect splicing, since splicing is often determined by a fine balance between several positive and negative splicing regulatory elements distributed throughout the exon. Finally, we identified a pseudoexon in intron 11, which would have pathogenic consequences if activated by mutations or improved splicing conditions. Exonic mutations that disrupt splicing are unlikely to facilitate response to BH(4) and may lead to inconsistent genotype-phenotype correlations. Therefore, recognizing such mutations enhances our ability to predict the BH(4)-response.	0
Glycogen Reduction in Myotubes of Late-Onset Pompe Disease Patients Using Antisense Technology. || Alleles Cell Line Exons Gene Order Genetic Vectors Glycogen Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Muscle Fibers, Skeletal Mutation Oligonucleotides, Antisense Protein Binding RNA Splicing RNA Splicing Factors Silencer Elements, Transcriptional Targeted Gene Repair alpha-Glucosidases || Glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) is a lysosomal disorder caused by the deficient activity of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme, leading to the accumulation of glycogen within the lysosomes. The disease has been classified in infantile and late-onset forms. Most late-onset patients share a splicing mutation c.-32-13T > G in intron 1 of the GAA gene that prevents efficient recognition of exon 2 by the spliceosome. In this study, we have mapped the splicing silencers of GAA exon 2 and developed antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs) to inhibit those regions and rescue normal splicing in the presence of the c.-32-13T > G mutation. Using a minigene approach and patient fibroblasts, we successfully increased inclusion of exon 2 in the mRNA and GAA enzyme production by targeting a specific silencer with a combination of AMOs. Most importantly, the use of these AMOs in patient myotubes results in a decreased accumulation of glycogen. To our knowledge, this is the only therapeutic approach resulting in a decrease of glycogen accumulation in patient tissues beside enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and TFEB overexpression. As a result, it may represent a highly novel and promising therapeutic line for GSDII.	1
Ribosomal proteins and human diseases: pathogenesis, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic implications. || Cell Nucleolus Disease Humans Mitochondria Ribosomal Proteins Ribosomes Stress, Physiological || Ribosomes are essential components of the protein synthesis machinery. The process of ribosome biogenesis is well organized and tightly regulated. Recent studies have shown that ribosomal proteins (RPs) have extraribosomal functions that are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and other cellular processes. The dysfunction of RPs has been linked to the development and progression of hematological, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Perturbation of ribosome biogenesis results in ribosomal stress, which triggers activation of the p53 signaling pathway through RPs-MDM2 interactions, resulting in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RPs also regulate cellular functions through p53-independent mechanisms. We herein review the recent advances in several forefronts of RP research, including the understanding of their biological features and roles in regulating cellular functions, maintaining cell homeostasis, and their involvement in the pathogenesis of human diseases. We also highlight the translational potential of this research for the identification of molecular biomarkers, and in the discovery and development of novel treatments for human diseases.	0
Searching for E-cadherin gene mutations in early onset diffuse gastric cancer and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer in Korean patients. || Adenocarcinoma Adult Antigens, CD Cadherins Female Follow-Up Studies Gene Deletion Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Immunoenzyme Techniques Male Mutation Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Republic of Korea Stomach Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The impact of CDH1 gene mutations and large deletions on hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) and early onset diffuse gastric cancer (EODGC) has not been determined in Asians. We investigated the mutation status of the CDH1 gene in 25 Korean EODGC patients younger than 50 years and 23 HDGC patients who met the clinical criteria for HDGC. Polymerase chain reaction-direct sequencing was performed, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to evaluate the patients with negative sequencing results. We determined that 2 of 25 (8 %) EODGC patients had CDH1 germline mutations. One was a nonsense mutation (c.1003C>T, p.Arg335*, exon 7) in a 41-year-old female with no family history of cancer. The other was a missense mutation (c.715G>A, p.Gly239Arg, exon 6) in a 28-year-old male with no family history of cancer. One of 23 (4.3 %) HDGC patients had a CDH1 germline mutation (c.1003C>T). The patient's brother and sister died of stomach cancer. The MLPA results revealed no deletion or duplication in any patient. More research is needed to determine additional genetic targets that trigger HDGC. More comprehensive methods such as next-generation sequencing might be a good approach that can be used to identify the genetic causes of pathogenetically unexplained disorders.	4
Age-Related Hearing Impairment (ARHI) associated with GJB2 single mutation IVS1+1G>A in the Yakut population isolate in Eastern Siberia. || Age Factors Asian Continental Ancestry Group Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Founder Effect Hearing Loss Humans Mutation Siberia || Age-Related Hearing Impairment (ARHI) is one of the frequent sensory disorders registered in 50% of individuals over 80 years. ARHI is a multifactorial disorder due to environmental and poor-known genetic components. In this study, we present the data on age-related hearing impairment of 48 heterozygous carriers of mutation IVS1+1G>A (GJB2 gene) and 97 subjects with GJB2 genotype wt/wt in the Republic of Sakha/Yakutia (Eastern Siberia, Russia). This subarctic territory was found as the region with the most extensive accumulation of mutation IVS1+1G>A in the world as a result of founder effect in the unique Yakut population isolate. The GJB2 gene resequencing and detailed audiological analysis in the frequency range 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 kHz were performed in all examined subjects that allowed to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations between the presence of single mutation IVS1+1G>A and hearing of subjects from examined groups. We revealed the linear correlation between increase of average hearing thresholds at speech frequencies (PTA0.5,1.0,2.0,4.0 kHz) and age of individuals with GJB2 genotype IVS1+1G>A/wt (rs = 0.499, p = 0.006860 for males and rs = 0.427, p = 0.000277 for females). Moreover, the average hearing thresholds on high frequency (8.0 kHz) in individuals with genotype IVS1+1G>A/wt (both sexes) were significantly worse than in individuals with genotype wt/wt (p<0.05). Age of hearing loss manifestation in individuals with genotype IVS1+1G>A/wt was estimated to be ∼40 years (rs = 0.504, p = 0.003). These findings demonstrate that the single IVS1+1G>A mutation (GJB2) is associated with age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) of the IVS1+1G>A carriers in the Yakuts.	4
PP2A-B56α controls oncogene-induced senescence in normal and tumor human melanocytic cells. || Cell Line, Tumor Cellular Senescence Genes, myc Humans Melanocytes Melanoma Protein Phosphatase 2 Protein Stability Up-Regulation || Oncoprotein C-MYC is overexpressed in human metastatic melanomas and melanoma-derived cells where it is required for the suppression of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). The genetic events that maintain high levels of C-MYC in melanoma cells and their role in OIS are unknown. Here we report that C-MYC in cells from several randomly chosen melanoma lines was upregulated at the protein level, and largely because of the increased protein stability. Of all known regulators of C-MYC stability, levels of B56α subunit of the PP2A tumor suppressor complex were substantially suppressed in all human melanoma cells compared with normal melanocytes. Accordingly, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the lowest and the highest amounts of PP2A-B56α were predominantly detected in metastatic melanoma tissues and in primary melanomas from patients with good clinical outcome, respectively. Importantly, PP2A-B56α overexpression suppressed C-MYC in melanoma cells and induced OIS, whereas depletion of PP2A-B56α in normal human melanocytes upregulated C-MYC protein levels and suppressed BRAF(V600E)- and, less efficiently, NRAS(Q61R)-induced senescence. Our data reveal a mechanism of C-MYC overexpression in melanoma cells and identify a functional role for PP2A-B56α in OIS of melanocytic cells.	0
Troponin T and beta-myosin mutations have distinct cardiac functional effects in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients without hypertrophy. || Adenosine Triphosphate Adult Animals Calcium Signaling Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Echocardiography, Doppler Female Genotype Heart Ventricles Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle Strength Mutation Myocardial Contraction Myocardium Myosin Heavy Chains Phenotype Troponin T Ventricular Function, Left || The validity of genotype:phenotype correlation studies in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has recently been questioned, yet animal models and in vitro studies suggest distinct effects for different mutations. The aims of this study were to investigate whether distinct HCM-mutations have different consequences for cardiac structure and function in the absence of the confounding effects of hypertrophy. Individuals aged 20-65 belonging to 21 R92W(TNNT2), R403W(MYH7), or A797T(MYH7) mutation-bearing families were investigated with 2D, M-mode, and Doppler echocardiography. Cardiac structural and functional parameters were compared between prehypertrophic mutation-carriers and their non-carrier family members, with concomitant adjustment for appropriate covariates. Findings were evaluated against existing animal and in vitro functional data. The distinct functional effect of the R92W(TNNT) mutation was a relative increase in systolic functional parameters, that of the A797T(MYH7) mutation was reduced diastolic function, while the R403W(MYH7) mutation reduced both systolic and diastolic function. The observed early effects of the R92W(TNNT2) mutation mechanistically fit with prolonged force-transients precipitated by increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of the thin filament, and that of the MYH7 mutations with local ATP depletion. Evaluation of the impact of the mutations on cardiac structure and function in prehypertrophic mutation-carriers, relative to the baseline norm provided by their non-carrier family members, best recapitulated existing animal and in vitro functional data, while inclusion of mutation-carriers with hypertrophy obscured such findings. The results prompt speculation that timely treatment aimed at ameliorating Ca(2+) sensitivity for R92W(TNNT2)-carriers, and energy depletion for MYH7 mutation-carriers, may offer a plausible approach for preventing progression from a preclinical into a decompensated state.	4
Mutant p53-R273H gains new function in sustained activation of EGFR signaling via suppressing miR-27a expression. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic ErbB Receptors Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mice MicroRNAs Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3 Mutation Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || p53 is a major tumor suppressor whose function is pivotal for protection against cancer. In over half of human cancers, p53 is inactivated due to either point mutation or loss of p53 gene. It has been well established that in addition to abrogating the tumor-suppressive function of wild-type p53, mutant p53 gains new functions and actively contributes to various stages of tumor progression. However, little is known about whether microRNA (miRNA) is involved in the gain-of-function of mutant p53. Here we report miR-27a as a novel downstream transcriptional target of mutant p53-273H. Mutant p53 binds to the miR-27a promoter region and suppresses its expression. We also identify epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a direct target of miR-27a. Via the miR-27a/EGFR axis, mutant p53-273H promotes a sustained EGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation, thereby facilitating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Collectively, this work reveals a direct link between the gain-of-function of mutant p53 and miRNA and uncovers a novel mutant p53-273H/miR-27a/EGFR pathway that has an important role in promoting tumor development.	0
Burst-Like Transcription of Mutant and Wildtype MYH7-Alleles as Possible Origin of Cell-to-Cell Contractile Imbalance in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. ||  || Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been related to many different mutations in more than 20 different, mostly sarcomeric proteins. While development of the HCM-phenotype is thought to be triggered by the different mutations, a common mechanism remains elusive. Studying missense-mutations in the ventricular beta-myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC, MYH7) we hypothesized that significant contractile heterogeneity exists among individual cardiomyocytes of HCM-patients that results from cell-to-cell variation in relative expression of mutated vs. wildtype β-MyHC. To test this hypothesis, we measured force-calcium-relationships of cardiomyocytes isolated from myocardium of heterozygous HCM-patients with either β-MyHC-mutation Arg723Gly or Arg200Val, and from healthy controls. From the myocardial samples of the HCM-patients we also obtained cryo-sections, and laser-microdissected single cardiomyocytes for quantification of mutated vs. wildtypeMYH7-mRNA using a single cell RT-qPCR and restriction digest approach. We characterized gene transcription by visualizing active transcription sites by fluorescencein situ hybridization of intronic and exonic sequences ofMYH7-pre-mRNA. For both mutations, cardiomyocytes showed large cell-to-cell variation in Ca++-sensitivity. Interestingly, some cardiomyocytes were essentially indistinguishable from controls what might indicate that they had no mutant β-MyHC while others had highly reduced Ca++-sensitivity suggesting substantial fractions of mutant β-MyHC. Single-cellMYH7-mRNA-quantification in cardiomyocytes of the same patients revealed high cell-to-cell variability of mutated vs. wildtype mRNA, ranging from essentially pure mutant to essentially pure wildtypeMYH7-mRNA. We found 27% of nuclei without active transcription sites which is inconsistent with continuous gene transcription but suggests burst-like transcription ofMYH7. Model simulations indicated that burst-like, stochastic on/off-switching ofMYH7 transcription, which is independent for mutant and wildtype alleles, could generate the observed cell-to-cell variation in the fraction of mutant vs. wildtypeMYH7-mRNA, a similar variation in β-MyHC-protein, and highly heterogeneous Ca++-sensitivity of individual cardiomyocytes. In the long run, such contractile imbalance in the myocardium may well induce progressive structural distortions like cellular and myofibrillar disarray and interstitial fibrosis, as they are typically observed in HCM.	4
The germline mutational landscape of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Brazil. ||  || The detection of germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is essential to the formulation of clinical management strategies, and in Brazil, there is limited access to these services, mainly due to the costs/availability of genetic testing. Aiming at the identification of recurrent mutations that could be included in a low-cost mutation panel, used as a first screening approach, we compiled the testing reports of 649 probands with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants referred to 28 public and private health care centers distributed across 11 Brazilian States. Overall, 126 and 103 distinct mutations were identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. Twenty-six novel variants were reported from both genes, and BRCA2 showed higher mutational heterogeneity. Some recurrent mutations were reported exclusively in certain geographic regions, suggesting a founder effect. Our findings confirm that there is significant molecular heterogeneity in these genes among Brazilian carriers, while also suggesting that this heterogeneity precludes the use of screening protocols that include recurrent mutation testing only. This is the first study to show that profiles of recurrent mutations may be unique to different Brazilian regions. These data should be explored in larger regional cohorts to determine if screening with a panel of recurrent mutations would be effective.	4
A Pathway to Personalizing Therapy for Metastases Using Liver-on-a-Chip Platforms. || Animals Hepatocytes Humans Lab-On-A-Chip Devices Liver Liver Neoplasms Neoplasm Metastasis Precision Medicine || Metastasis accounts for most cancer-related deaths. The majority of solid cancers, including those of the breast, colorectum, prostate and skin, metastasize at significant levels to the liver due to its hemodynamic as well as tumor permissive microenvironmental properties. As this occurs prior to detection and treatment of the primary tumor, we need to target liver metastases to improve patients' outcomes. Animal models, while proven to be useful in mechanistic studies, do not represent the heterogeneity of human population especially in drug metabolism lack proper human cell-cell interactions, and this gap between animals and humans results in costly and inefficient drug discovery. This underscores the need to accurately model the human liver for disease studies and drug development. Further, the occurrence of liver metastases is influenced by the primary tumor type, sex and race; thus, modeling these specific settings will facilitate the development of personalized/targeted medicine for each specific group. We have adapted such all-human 3D ex vivo hepatic microphysiological system (MPS) (a.k.a. liver-on-a-chip) to investigate human micrometastases. This review focuses on the sources of liver resident cells, especially the iPS cell-derived hepatocytes, and examines some of the advantages and disadvantages of these sources. In addition, this review also examines other potential challenges and limitations in modeling human liver.	0
Mosaic NRAS Q61R mutation in a child with giant congenital melanocytic naevus, epidermal naevus syndrome and hypophosphataemic rickets. || Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Male Membrane Proteins Mosaicism Mutation Nevus Nevus, Pigmented Rickets, Hypophosphatemic Skin Skin Neoplasms || The association of hypophosphataemic rickets with verrucous epidermal naevus (EN) and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 levels is known as cutaneous-skeletal hypophosphataemia syndrome (CSHS), and can be caused by somatic activating mutations in RAS genes. We report a unique patient with CSHS associated with giant congenital melanocytic naevus (CMN), neurocutaneous melanosis and EN syndrome, manifesting as facial linear sebaceous naevus, developmental delay and ocular dermoids. An activating mutation Q61R in the NRAS gene was found in affected skin and ocular tissue but not blood, implying that the disparate manifestations are due to a multilineage activating mutation (mosaic RASopathy). We speculate on the apparently rare association of CSHS with CMN compared with EN. We also report the favourable outcome of this patient at the age of 8 years after extensive neonatal curettage of the giant CMN and use of vitamin D and phosphate supplementation.	4
The interaction of p53 with replication protein A mediates suppression of homologous recombination. || Base Sequence Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival DNA Primers DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Mutation Protein Binding Recombination, Genetic Replication Protein A Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The tumor suppressor protein p53 is emerging as a central regulator of homologous recombination (HR) processes and DNA replication. P53 may downregulate HR through multiple mechanisms including the reported associations with the Rad51 and Rad54 recombinases, and the BLM and WRN helicases. Here, we investigated whether the interaction of p53 with human replication protein A (RPA) is necessary for the regulation of HR. By employing a plasmid-based HR assay in p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells, we studied the HR-suppressing properties of a panel of p53 mutants, which varied in their ability to interact with RPA. Both wild-type p53 and a transactivation-deficient p53 mutant (L22Q/W23S) suppressed HR and prevented RPA binding to ssDNA in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, p53 mutations that specifically disrupt the RPA-binding domain, while not compromising p53 transactivation function (D48H/D49H and W53S/F54S), did not affect HR. Suppression of HR was also not seen with missense mutations in the p53 core domain (His175 and His273), which retained the ability to interact with RPA, suggesting that the disruption of additional binding interactions of p53, for example, with Rad51 or recombination intermediates, also impacts on HR. We hypothesize that sequestration of RPA by p53 at the sites of recombination is one means by which p53 can inhibit HR processes. Our data support and extend the previously formulated 'dual model' of p53's role as guardian of the genome.	0

Four hundred (43.72%, 400/915) newborn were detected to carry at least one mutation allele in GJB2. 3 (0.33%, 3/915) newborn had pathogenic mutations (c. 94C>T, c. 380G>T, c. 344T>G); 62 (6.76%, 62/915) newborn carried 14 undefined variant, 36 newborn had c. 109G>A (58.06%, 36/62),13 newborn had c. 368C>A (20.97%,13/62), six (c. 268C>G, c. 282C>T, c. 294G>C, 456C>T, c. 501G>A, c. 587T>C) are novel; 335 (36.61%, 335/915) newborn were polymorphism. The probability of hereditary hearing loss is 7.09% in newborn with GJB2 heterozygous mutation in Beijing. It is noteworthy that c. 109G>A, c. 368C>A occupy a high proportion.	4
A novel BRCA2 mutation in prostate cancer sensitive to combined radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy. ||  || Genetic factors contribute to more than 40% of prostate cancer risk, and mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are well-established risk factors. By using target capture-based deep sequencing to identify potential pathogenic germline mutations, followed by Sanger sequencing to determine the loci of the mutations, we identified a novel pathogenic BRCA2 mutation caused by a cytosine-to-guanine base substitution at position 4211, resulting in protein truncation (p.Ser1404Ter), which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Analysis of peripheral blood also identified benign polymorphisms in BRCA2 (c.7397T>C, p.Val2466Ala) and SRD5A2 (c.87G>C, p.Lys29Asn). Analysis of tumor tissues revealed seven somatic mutations in prostate tumor tissue and nine somatic mutations in esophageal squamous carcinoma tissue (single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions). Five-year follow-up results indicate that ADT combined with radiotherapy successfully treated the prostate cancer. To our knowledge, we are the first to report the germline BRCA2 mutation c.4211C>G (p.Ser1404Ter) in prostate cancer. Combined ADT and radiotherapy may be effective in treating other patients with prostate cancer caused by this or similar mutations.	4
Targeted next generation sequencing in Chinese colorectal cancer patients guided anti-EGFR treatment and facilitated precision cancer medicine. ||  || Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with both RAS andBRAF wild-type tumors determined by non-next generation sequencing (NGS) testing may still not respond due to the presence of additional mutated genes such asPIK3CA orPTEN. In this study, a broad, hybrid capture-based NGS assay was used to identifyRAS, BRAF and additional targetable genetic alterations from Chinese CRC tissues. Fifty-seven cases of CRC were enrolled, and all the patients signed the informed consent. In total, 7708 exons of 508 tumor-related genes and 78 introns of 19 frequently rearranged genes were assessed for base substitutions, INDELs, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. The study found that 50.9% (29/57) of the tumors harbored KRAS mutations, 3.5% (2/57) harboredNRAS mutations and 3.5% (2/57) harboredBRAF mutations. More specifically, 89.7% (26/29) ofRAS mutations were located in codon 12. Except forRAS andRAF, anti-EGFR therapy response genetic mutations inPTEN (n=2) andPIK3CA (n=1) were found in 4.7% (3/64) of the samples. Actionable alterations were found inHER2 (n = 7),CCND2 (n = 2),NF1 (n = 1), andBRCA1 (n = 1). Our results illustrated that 82.5% (47/57) of the samples harbored at least one actionable genetic alteration identified by NGS. HER2 amplifications or mutations, which were identified in 12.3% of the tissues, defined a unique molecular subtype of CRC. The study suggests that high-throughput NGS testing in CRC tissues is a comprehensive and efficient genomic profiling assay to guide personalized therapy.	4
[Analysis of RFLP haplotypes and point mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus in PKU families from north China]. ||  || A study of DNA polymorphisms at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus was performed using 28 classical phenylketonuria (PKU) families from North China. In the families analyzed, haplotype 4 accounted for 77% of normal chromosomes and 79% of PKU gene bearing chromosomes. Two new haplotypes, haplotypes 49 and 50, were found. On the basis of haplotype analysis, only 37%-40% of PKU carriers in North China were heterozygous and therefore informative for linkage studies. Exon 3 (Arg111----stop) and exon 6 (Tyr204----Cys204) mutations of the PAH gene were studied using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization in 42 PKU families from North China. These accounted for 3.6% and 9.5% of PKU mutations in North China, respectively.	3
PKU in Slovakia: mutation screening and haplotype analysis. || Haplotypes Humans Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Slovakia || The restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes and seven common mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene were analysed in 49 unrelated Slovak phenylketonuria (PKU) families of Caucasian origin. The predominant mutation in this population sample is R408W, with a frequency of 45.9%. In addition, four other mutations have been identified at relatively high frequencies: IVS12nt1, 10.2%; R158Q, 7.1%; R261Q, 7.1%; R252W, 2.0%. The mutation-haplotype associations correspond to those described in other European populations. The high proportion of mutations (72.4%) amenable to simple rapid detection based on the polymerase chain reaction provides a good basis for direct DNA-diagnosis of PKU in the Slovak population.	1 3
Human diseases associated with connexin mutations. || Connexins Genetic Diseases, Inborn Humans || Gap junctions and hemichannels comprised of connexins impact many cellular processes. Significant advances in our understanding of the functional role of these channels have been made by the identification of a host of genetic diseases caused by connexin mutations. Prominent features of connexin disorders are the inability of other connexins expressed in the same cell type to compensate for the mutated one, and the ability of connexin mutants to dominantly influence the activity of other wild-type connexins. Functional studies have begun to identify some of the underlying mechanisms whereby connexin channel mutation contributes to the disease state. Detailed mechanistic understanding of these functional differences will help to facilitate new pathophysiology driven therapies for the diverse array of connexin genetic disorders.

p120Ras-GAP binds the DLC1 Rho-GAP tumor suppressor protein and inhibits its RhoA GTPase and growth-suppressing activities. || Catalytic Domain Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation GTPase-Activating Proteins Humans Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Proteins p120 GTPase Activating Protein rhoA GTP-Binding Protein src Homology Domains || DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), which encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (Rho-GAP), is a potent tumor suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated in several human cancers. DLC1 is a multidomain protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the tensin gene family. Here we show that p120Ras-GAP (Ras-GAP; also known as RASA1) interacts and extensively colocalizes with DLC1 in focal adhesions. The binding was mapped to the SH3 domain located in the N terminus of Ras-GAP and to the Rho-GAP catalytic domain located in the C terminus of the DLC1. In vitro analyses with purified proteins determined that the isolated Ras-GAP SH3 domain inhibits DLC1 Rho-GAP activity, suggesting that Ras-GAP is a negative regulator of DLC1 Rho-GAP activity. Consistent with this possibility, we found that ectopic overexpression of Ras-GAP in a Ras-GAP-insensitive tumor line impaired the growth-suppressing activity of DLC1 and increased RhoA activity in vivo. Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate DLC1 function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and Rho GTPases.1R01CA129610	0
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Arrhythmias, Cardiac Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Diastole Disease Progression Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Muscle Cells Mutation Phenotype Risk Factors Sarcomeres || Important insights into the molecular basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related diseases have been gained by studying families with inherited cardiac hypertrophy. Integrated clinical and genetic investigations have demonstrated that different genetic defects can give rise to the common phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy. Diverse pathways have been identified, implicating perturbations in force generation, force transmission, intracellular calcium homeostasis, myocardial energetics, and cardiac metabolism in causing disease. Although not fully elucidated, the fundamental mechanisms linking gene mutations to clinical disease are being characterized. Further advances will allow a better understanding of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, not just of relatively rare inherited cardiomyopathies, but potentially also of relevance to more common acquired forms of hypertrophic remodeling.	4
Minimal incidence of neonatal/infancy onset diabetes in Italy is 1:90,000 live births. || Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 Female Humans Incidence Infant Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases Italy Live Birth Male Mutation || Until early 2000, permanent and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), defined as diabetes with onset within 6 weeks from birth that requires insulin therapy for at least 2 weeks, were considered exceedingly rare conditions, with a global incidence of 1:500,000-1:400,000 live births. The new definition of NDM recently adopted, that includes patients with diabetes onset within 6 months of age, has prompted studies that have set the incidence of the permanent form alone between 1:210,000 and 1:260,000 live births. Aim of the present work was to ascertain the incidence of NDM (i.e. permanent + transient form) in Italy for years 2005-2010. Patients referred to the Italian reference laboratory for NDM between years 2005 and 2010 and screened for mutations in common NDM genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS) and for uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (UDP6) were reviewed. A questionnaire aimed at identifying NDM cases investigated in other laboratories was sent to 54 Italian reference centers for pediatric diabetes. Twenty-seven patients with NDM born between 2005 and 2010 were referred to the reference laboratory. In this group, a mutation of either KCNJ11, ABCC8 or INS was found in 18 patients, and a case with UDP6 was identified. Questionnaires revealed 4 additional cases with transient neonatal diabetes due to UDP6. Incidence of NDM was calculated at 1:90,000 (CI: 1:63,000-1:132,000) live births. Thus, with the definition currently in use, about 6 new cases with NDM are expected to be born in Italy each year.	4
Associations between GJB2, mitochondrial 12S rRNA, SLC26A4 mutations, and hearing loss among three ethnicities. || Adolescent Adult Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Ethnic Groups Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation RNA, Ribosomal Sulfate Transporters || The epidemiological researches show that the mutations of GJB2, mitochondrial 12S rRNA, and SLC26A4 genes have played an important role in the hearing loss. This study aims to investigate the mutation spectrum of GJB2, mitochondrial 12S rRNA, and SLC26A4 genes of Han Chinese, Hui people, and Uyghur ethnicities in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients in northwest of China. Mutational analyses in the three genes were brought by direct sequencing and each fragment was analyzed using an ABI 3730 DNA Sequencer. The mutation frequencies for the three HL causative genes were 34.05% in Han Chinese participants, 27.47% in Hui people, and 14.44% in Uyghur participants, respectively. The prevalence of GJB2 mutations was 13.7%, 11.4%, and 11.4% in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Uyghur participants (χ(2) = 10.2, P < 0.05), respectively. The prevalence of mtDNA 12S rRNA A1555G homozygous mutations was 6.05%, 3.27%, and 1.44% in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Uyghur participants (χ(2) = 13.9, P < 0.05), respectively. The prevalence of SLC26A4 mutations was 14.3%, 12.8%, and 1.6% in Han Chinese, Hui people, and Uyghur participants, respectively. In summary, we find that Uyghur and Hui SNHL individuals vary significantly from Han Chinese patients in three causative HL genes' mutational spectrum, especially for Uyghur.	4
Clonal hematopoiesis and blood-cancer risk inferred from blood DNA sequence. || Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Blood Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Clone Cells DNA Mutational Analysis Exome Hematologic Neoplasms Hematopoiesis Hematopoietic Stem Cells Humans Middle Aged Mutation Risk Factors Young Adult || Cancers arise from multiple acquired mutations, which presumably occur over many years. Early stages in cancer development might be present years before cancers become clinically apparent. We analyzed data from whole-exome sequencing of DNA in peripheral-blood cells from 12,380 persons, unselected for cancer or hematologic phenotypes. We identified somatic mutations on the basis of unusual allelic fractions. We used data from Swedish national patient registers to follow health outcomes for 2 to 7 years after DNA sampling. Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations was observed in 10% of persons older than 65 years of age but in only 1% of those younger than 50 years of age. Detectable clonal expansions most frequently involved somatic mutations in three genes (DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2) that have previously been implicated in hematologic cancers. Clonal hematopoiesis was a strong risk factor for subsequent hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 12.9; 95% confidence interval, 5.8 to 28.7). Approximately 42% of hematologic cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had clonality at the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before a first diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens obtained from two patients at the time of diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia revealed that their cancers arose from the earlier clones. Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations is readily detected by means of DNA sequencing, is increasingly common as people age, and is associated with increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of the genes that are mutated in patients with myeloid cancers is frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these mutations may represent characteristic early events in the development of hematologic cancers.

Inhibition of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 activity and induction of p53 degradation by the natural phenolic compound curcumin. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cells, Cultured Curcumin Humans Mice Mutation, Missense NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone) Neoplasms Thymus Gland Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin || NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) regulates the stability of the tumor suppressor WT p53. NQO1 binds and stabilizes WT p53, whereas NQO1 inhibitors including dicoumarol and various other coumarins and flavones induce ubiquitin-independent proteasomal p53 degradation and thus inhibit p53-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that curcumin, a natural phenolic compound found in the spice turmeric, induced ubiquitin-independent degradation of WT p53 and inhibited p53-induced apoptosis in normal thymocytes and myeloid leukemic cells. Like dicoumarol, curcumin inhibited the activity of recombinant NQO1 in vitro, inhibited the activity of endogenous cellular NQO1 in vivo, and dissociated NQO1-WT p53 complexes. Neither dicoumarol nor curcumin dissociated the complexes of NQO1 and the human cancer hot-spot p53 R273H mutant and therefore did not induce degradation of this mutant. NQO1 knockdown by small-interfering RNA induced degradation of both WT p53 and the p53 R273H mutant. The results indicate that curcumin induces p53 degradation and inhibits p53-induced apoptosis by an NQO1-dependent pathway.	0
Elevated expression of ribosomal protein genes L37, RPP-1, and S2 in the presence of mutant p53. || Animals Blotting, Northern Blotting, Western Colonic Neoplasms DNA, Complementary Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Humans In Situ Hybridization Mice Peptide Fragments Point Mutation Ribosomal Proteins Sensitivity and Specificity Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The wild-type p53 protein is a DNA-binding transcription factor that activates genes such as p21, MDM2, GADD45, and Bax that are required for the regulation of cell cycle progression or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Mutant forms of p53, which are transforming oncogenes and are expressed at high levels in tumor cells, generally have a reduced binding affinity for the consensus DNA sequence. Interestingly, some p53 mutants that are no longer effective at binding to the consensus DNA sequence and transactivating promoters containing this target site have acquired the ability to transform cells in culture, in part through their ability to transactivate promoters of a number of genes that are not targets of the wild-type protein. Certain p53 mutants are therefore considered to be gain-of-function mutants and appear to be promoting proliferation or transforming cells through their ability to alter the expression of novel sets of genes. Our goal is to identify genes that have altered expression in the presence of a specific mutant p53 (Arg to Trp mutation at codon 248) protein. Through examining differential gene expression in cells devoid of p53 expression and in cells that express high levels of mutant p53 protein, we have identified three ribosomal protein genes that have elevated expression in response to mutant p53. Consistent with these findings, the overexpression of a number of ribosomal protein genes in human tumors and evidence for their contribution to oncogenic transformation have been reported previously, although the mechanism leading to this overexpression has remained elusive. We show results that indicate that expression of these specific ribosomal protein genes is increased in the presence of the R248W p53 mutant, which provides a mechanism for their overexpression in human tumors.	0
Conversion of fibroblasts to neural cells by p53 depletion. || Animals Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors Cell Line Fibroblasts Humans Mice Neural Stem Cells Neurogenesis Neurons Neuropeptides Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Conversion from fibroblasts to neurons has recently been successfully induced. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we find that depletion of p53 alone converts fibroblasts into all three major neural lineages. The induced neuronal cells express multiple neuron-specific proteins and generate action potentials and transmitter-receptor-mediated currents. Surprisingly, depletion does not affect the well-known tumorigenic p53 target, p21. Instead, knockdown of p53 upregulates neurogenic transcription factors, which in turn boosts fibroblast-neuron conversion. p53 binds the promoter of the neurogenic transcription factor Neurod2 and regulates its expression during fibroblast-neuron conversion. Furthermore, our method provides a high efficiency of conversion in late-passage fibroblasts. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that the p53-deficiency-induced neurons exhibit an expression profile different from parental fibroblasts and similar to control-induced neurons. The results may help to understand and improve neural conversion mechanisms to develop robust neuron-replacement therapy strategies.	0
Integrative genomic and transcriptomic characterization of papillary carcinomas of the breast. || Breast Neoplasms Carcinoma, Papillary Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genomics Humans Immunohistochemistry In Vitro Techniques Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide || Papillary carcinoma (PC) is a rare type of breast cancer, which comprises three histologic subtypes: encapsulated PC (EPC), solid PC (SPC) and invasive PC (IPC). Microarray-based gene expression and Affymetrix SNP 6.0 gene copy number profiling, and RNA-sequencing revealed that PCs are luminal breast cancers that display transcriptomic profiles distinct from those of grade- and estrogen receptor (ER)-matched invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC-NSTs), and that the papillary histologic pattern is unlikely to be underpinned by a highly recurrent expressed fusion gene or a highly recurrent expressed mutation. Despite displaying similar patterns of gene copy number alterations, significant differences in the transcriptomic profiles of EPCs, SPCs and IPCs were found, and may account for their different histologic features.	4
Genomic Evolution of Breast Cancer Metastasis and Relapse. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone Evolution, Molecular Female Humans Janus Kinase 2 Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasm Recurrence, Local STAT3 Transcription Factor Transcription Factors || Patterns of genomic evolution between primary and metastatic breast cancer have not been studied in large numbers, despite patients with metastatic breast cancer having dismal survival. We sequenced whole genomes or a panel of 365 genes on 299 samples from 170 patients with locally relapsed or metastatic breast cancer. Several lines of analysis indicate that clones seeding metastasis or relapse disseminate late from primary tumors, but continue to acquire mutations, mostly accessing the same mutational processes active in the primary tumor. Most distant metastases acquired driver mutations not seen in the primary tumor, drawing from a wider repertoire of cancer genes than early drivers. These include a number of clinically actionable alterations and mutations inactivating SWI-SNF and JAK2-STAT3 pathways.	4
Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA-Binding Proteins Female Gene Fusion Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Nuclear Proteins Paraganglioma Pheochromocytoma Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret RNA-Binding Proteins Transcription Factors || We report a comprehensive molecular characterization of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PCCs/PGLs), a rare tumor type. Multi-platform integration revealed that PCCs/PGLs are driven by diverse alterations affecting multiple genes and pathways. Pathogenic germline mutations occurred in eight PCC/PGL susceptibility genes. We identified CSDE1 as a somatically mutated driver gene, complementing four known drivers (HRAS, RET, EPAS1, and NF1). We also discovered fusion genes in PCCs/PGLs, involving MAML3, BRAF, NGFR, and NF1. Integrated analysis classified PCCs/PGLs into four molecularly defined groups: a kinase signaling subtype, a pseudohypoxia subtype, a Wnt-altered subtype, driven by MAML3 and CSDE1, and a cortical admixture subtype. Correlates of metastatic PCCs/PGLs included the MAML3 fusion gene. This integrated molecular characterization provides a comprehensive foundation for developing PCC/PGL precision medicine.	4
Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica is caused by a postzygotic HRAS mutation in a multipotent progenitor cell. || Adult Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Female Humans Mosaicism Multipotent Stem Cells Nevus, Pigmented Nevus, Sebaceous of Jadassohn Oncogene Protein p21(ras) Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Skin Neoplasms || Phacomatosis pigmentokeratotica (PPK) is a rare epidermal nevus syndrome characterized by the co-occurrence of a sebaceous nevus and a speckled lentiginous nevus. The coexistence of an epidermal and a melanocytic nevus has been explained by two homozygous recessive mutations, according to the twin spot hypothesis, of which PPK has become a putative paradigm in humans. However, the underlying gene mutations remained unknown. Multiple tissues of six patients with PPK were analyzed for the presence of RAS, FGFR3, PIK3CA, and BRAF mutations using SNaPshot assays and Sanger sequencing. We identified a heterozygous HRAS c.37G>C (p.Gly13Arg) mutation in four patients and a heterozygous HRAS c.182A>G (p.Gln61Arg) mutation in two patients. In each case, the mutations were present in both the sebaceous and the melanocytic nevus. In the latter lesion, melanocytes were identified to carry the HRAS mutation. Analysis of various nonlesional tissues showed a wild-type sequence of HRAS, consistent with mosaicism. Our data provide no genetic evidence for the previously proposed twin spot hypothesis. In contrast, PPK is best explained by a postzygotic-activating HRAS mutation in a multipotent progenitor cell that gives rise to both a sebaceous and a melanocytic nevus. Therefore, PPK is a mosaic RASopathy.	4
[ Spectrum of oncogene mutations is different in melanoma subtypes]. || BRAF DNA sequencing KIT KRAS NRAS PDGFRA acral melanoma amelanotic melanoma cutaneous melanoma melanoma mucosal melanoma mutations nevoid nodal melanoma oncogenes || Melanoma is the most lethal malignancy of skin, which is comprised of clinically relevant molecular subsets defined by specific "driver" mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT genes. Recently, the better results in melanoma treatment were obtained with the mutation-specific inhibitors that have been developed for clinical use and target only patients with particular tumor genotypes. The aim of the study was to characterize the spectrum of "driver" mutations in melanoma subtypes from 137 patients with skin melanoma and 14 patients with mucosal melanoma. In total 151 melanoma cases, the frequency of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS mutations was 55.0, 10.6, 4.0, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively. BRAF mutations were found in 69% of cutaneous melanoma without UV exposure and in 43% of cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (p=0.045), rarely in acral and mucosal melanomas. Most of melanomas containing BRAF mutations, V600E (92%) and V600K (6.0%) were potentially sensitive to inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib. NRAS mutations were more common in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (26.0%), in acral and mucosal melanomas; the dominant mutations being Q61R/K/L (87.5%). KIT mutations were found in cutaneous melanoma with chronic UV exposure (8.7%) and mucosal one (28.6%), but not in acral melanoma. Most of KIT mutations were identified in exon 11; these tumors being sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This is the first monitoring of BRAF, NRAS, KIT, PDGFRA, and KRAS hotspot mutations in different subtypes of melanoma for Russian population. On the base of data obtained, one can suppose that at the molecular level melanomas are heterogeneous tumors that should be tested for "driver" mutations in the each case for evaluation of the potential sensitivity to target therapy. The obtained results were used for treatment of melanoma patients.	4
Intermittent hypoxia selects for genotypes and phenotypes that increase survival, invasion, and therapy resistance. || Animals Biomarkers Cadherins Cell Hypoxia Cell Line, Tumor Disease Models, Animal Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Genetic Association Studies Genotype Glucose Transporter Type 1 Humans Hypoxia Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit Mice Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasms Phenotype Tumor Stem Cell Assay Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Hypoxia in tumors correlates with greater risk of metastases, increased invasiveness, and resistance to systemic and radiation therapy. The evolutionary dynamics that links specific adaptations to hypoxia with these observed tumor properties have not been well investigated. While some tumor populations may experience fixed hypoxia, cyclical and stochastic transitions from normoxia to hypoxia are commonly observed in vivo. Although some phenotypic adaptations to this cyclic hypoxia are likely reversible, we hypothesize that some adaptations may become fixed through mutations promoted by hypoxia-induced genomic instability. Here we seek to identify genetic alterations and corresponding stable phenotypes that emerge following cyclic hypoxia. Although these changes may originate as adaptations to this specific environmental stress, their fixation in the tumor genome may result in their observation in tumors from regions of normoxia, a condition known as pseudohypoxia. We exposed several epithelial cell lines to 50 cycles of hypoxia-normoxia, followed by culture in normoxia over a period of several months. Molecular analyses demonstrated permanent changes in expression of several oncogenes and tumor-suppressors, including p53, E-cadherin, and Hif-1α. These changes were associated with increased resistance to multiple cytotoxins, increased survival in hypoxia and increased anchorage-independent growth. These results suggest cycles of hypoxia encountered in early cancers can select for specific and stable genotypic and phenotypic properties that persist even in normoxic conditions, which may promote tumor progression and resistance to therapy.	0
Cancer3D 2.0: interactive analysis of 3D patterns of cancer mutations in cancer subsets. ||  || Our knowledge of cancer genomics exploded in last several years, providing us with detailed knowledge of genetic alterations in almost all cancer types. Analysis of this data gave us new insights into molecular aspects of cancer, most important being the amazing diversity of molecular abnormalities in individual cancers. The most important question in cancer research today is how to classify this diversity to identify subtypes that are most relevant for treatment and outcome prediction for individual patients. The Cancer3D database at http://www.cancer3d.org gives an open and user-friendly way to analyze cancer missense mutations in the context of structures of proteins they are found in and in relation to patients' clinical data. This approach allows users to find novel candidate driver regions for specific subgroups, that often cannot be found when similar analyses are done on the whole gene level and for large, diverse cohorts. Interactive interface allows user to visualize the distribution of mutations in subgroups defined by cancer type and stage, gender and age brackets, patient's ethnicity or vice versa find dominant cancer type, gender or age groups for specific three-dimensional mutation patterns.	4
High prevalence of TP53 mutations is associated with poor survival and an EMT signature in gliosarcoma patients. || Biomarkers, Tumor Brain Neoplasms Calcium Signaling Cell Line, Tumor Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Female Gliosarcoma Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Middle Aged Mutation Tight Junctions Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Gliosarcoma (GS) is a rare variant (2%) of glioblastoma (GBM) that poses clinical genomic challenges because of its poor prognosis and limited genomic information. To gain a comprehensive view of the genomic alterations in GS and to understand the molecular etiology of GS, we applied whole-exome sequencing analyses for 28 GS cases (6 blood-matched fresh-frozen tissues for the discovery set, 22 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues for the validation set) and copy-number variation microarrays for 5 blood-matched fresh-frozen tissues. TP53 mutations were more prevalent in the GS cases (20/28, 70%) compared to the GBM cases (29/90, 32%), and the GS patients with TP53 mutations showed a significantly shorter survival (multivariate Cox analysis, hazard ratio=23.9, 95% confidence interval, 2.87-199.63, P=0.003). A pathway analysis showed recurrent alterations in MAPK signaling (EGFR, RASGRF2 and TP53), phosphatidylinositol/calcium signaling (CACNA1s, PLCs and ITPRs) and focal adhesion/tight junction (PTEN and PAK3) pathways. Genomic profiling of the matched recurrent GS cases detected the occurrence of TP53 mutations in two recurrent GS cases, which suggests that TP53 mutations play a role in treatment resistance. Functionally, we found that TP53 mutations are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of sarcomatous components of GS. We provide the first comprehensive genome-wide genetic alternation profiling of GS, which suggests novel prognostic subgroups in GS patients based on their TP53 mutation status and provides new insight in the pathogenesis and targeted treatment of GS.	4
Relationship Between Patients with Clinical Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder and Mutations in Gjb2 Gene. ||  || The auditory neuropathy is a condition which there is a dyssynchrony in the nerve conduction of the auditory nerve fibers. There is no evidence about the relationship between patients with clinical auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder and mutations in GJB2 gene. There are only two studies about this topic in the medical literature. Connexin 26 (GJB2 gene) mutations are common causes of genetic deafness in many populations and we also being reported in subjects with auditory neuropathy. To analyze the pattern of clinical relationship between patients with clinical diagnosis with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder and GJB2 gene. Study Design - Retrospective analysis and genetic evaluation. Setting - Tertiary referral center. Subjects - 40 patients with Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder. Intervention - Clinical information and genetic evaluation (GJB2 gene) were analyzed. Biallelic mutations that accounted for hearing loss (HL) were found in three patients, both with c.35delG mutation in homozygous state. The splice site mutation IVS1+1G>A was detected in heterozygous state in one individual. However, since the second mutant allele was not identified, it was not possible to establish its correlation with the phenotype. Mutations in GJB2 gene mutations were found in 7.5% of the patients with ANSD. We found no relationship between patients with clinical auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder and mutations in GJB2 gene (p>0.05).	4
Phenylketonuria mutations in Europe. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is heterogeneous. More than 400 different mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene have been identified. In a systematic review of the molecular genetics of PKU in Europe we identified 29 mutations that may be regarded as prevalent in European populations. Comprehensive regional data for these mutations were collated from all available studies. The spectrum of mutations found in individual regions results from a combination of factors including founder effect, range expansion and migration, genetic drift, and probably heterozygote advantage. Common mutations include R408W on a haplotype 2 background in Eastern Europe, IVS10-11G>A in the Mediterranean, IVS12+1G>A in Denmark and England, Y414C in Scandinavia, I65T in Western Europe, and R408W on haplotype 1 in the British Isles. Molecular data from mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) patients are available from a number of countries, but it is currently not possible to calculate relative allele frequencies. The available data on PAH mutations are useful for the understanding of both the clinical features and the population genetics of PAH deficiency in Europe.	1 3
Evidence for a spontaneous C1840-T mutation in the RYR1 gene after DNA fingerprinting in a malignant hyperthermia susceptible family. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Cytosine DNA Fingerprinting Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Male Malignant Hyperthermia Middle Aged Pedigree Point Mutation Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel Thymine || Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially lethal inherited pharmacogenetic syndrome due to a dysfunction of the intracellular calcium regulation of skeletal muscle following administration of volatile anaesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. The ryanodine receptor of skeletal muscle (RYR1), which is an intracellular calcium release channel, has been proposed to be a candidate structure for the MH defect. In some families with a history of MH a C1840-T nucleotide exchange has been found in the RYR1 gene which cosegregates with the MH susceptible phenotype. Sixteen individuals (5 males and 11 females; age 8-68 years, 7 MH susceptible, 9 MH non-susceptible) of a family with a history of MH were screened for the C1840-T mutation in the RYR1 gene using standard methods. DNA fingerprinting was performed in order to verify the kinship. MH susceptibility was determined using the standard in vitro contracture test with halothane and caffeine. The present article describes a German MH pedigree carrying a spontaneous C1840-T mutation. The mutation was detected in one individual of the third generation. This person was classified as MH susceptible according to the in vitro contracture test protocol. None of the other family members (6 MH susceptible and 9 MH non-susceptible persons), including the parents of the child carrying the mutation, presented the C to T nucleotide exchange at position 1840.This novel observation clearly demonstrates that only the detection of the C1840-T mutation may lead to the diagnosis of MH susceptibility, but missing the mutation does not justify diagnosing a patient as non-susceptible within a single pedigree.	4
NVP-LDE225, a potent and selective SMOOTHENED antagonist reduces melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Biphenyl Compounds Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival Disease Models, Animal Female G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Hedgehog Proteins Humans Indoles Melanoma Mice Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Pyridines Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled Signal Transduction Smoothened Receptor Sulfonamides Transcription Factors Tumor Burden Vemurafenib Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays Zinc Finger Protein GLI1 || Melanoma is one of the most aggressive cancers and its incidence is increasing worldwide. So far there are no curable therapies especially after metastasis. Due to frequent mutations in members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, this pathway is constitutively active in melanoma. It has been shown that the SONIC HEDGEHOG (SHH)-GLI and MAPK signaling pathway regulate cell growth in many tumors including melanoma and interact with each other in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Here we show that the SHH-GLI pathway is active in human melanoma cell lines as they express downstream target of this pathway GLI1. Expression of GLI1 was significantly higher in human primary melanoma tissues harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation than those with wild type BRAF. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF(V600E) in human melanoma cell lines resulted in decreased expression of GLI1 thus demonstrating interaction of SHH-GLI and MAPK pathways. Inhibition of SHH-GLI pathway by the novel small molecule inhibitor of smoothened NVP-LDE225 was followed by inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in human melanoma cell lines, interestingly with both BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(Wild Type) status. NVP-LDE225 was potent in reducing cell proliferation and inducing tumor growth arrest in vitro and in vivo, respectively and these effects were superior to the natural compound cyclopamine. Finally, we conclude that inhibition of SHH-GLI signaling pathway in human melanoma by the specific smoothened inhibitor NVP-LDE225 could have potential therapeutic application in human melanoma even in the absence of BRAF(V600E) mutation and warrants further investigations.	0
Genetic diversity within the R408W phenylketonuria mutation lineages in Europe. ||  || The R408W phenylketonuria mutation in Europe has arisen by recurrent mutation in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus and is associated with two major PAH haplotypes. R408W-2.3 exhibits a west-to-east cline of relative frequency reaching its maximum in the Balto-Slavic region, while R408W-1.8 exhibits an east-to-west cline peaking in Connacht, the most westerly province of Ireland. Spatial autocorrelation analysis has demonstrated that the R408W-2.3 cline, like that of R408W-1.8, is consistent with a pattern likely to have been established by human dispersal. Genetic diversity within wild-type and R408W chromosomes in Europe was assessed through variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) nucleotide sequence variation and tetranucleotide short tandem repeat (STR) allelic associations. Wild-type VNTR-8 chromosomes exhibited two major cassette sequence organizations: (a1)5-b3-b2-c1 and (a1)5-b5-b2-c1. R408W-1.8 was predominantly associated with (a1)5-B5-B2-C1. Both wild-type vntr-3 and r408w-2.3 chromosomes exhibited a single invariant cassette sequence organization, a2-b2-c1. STR allele distributions associated with the cassette variants were consistent with greater diversity in the wild-type VNTR-8 lineage and were suggestive of different levels of diversity between R408W-1.8 and R408W-2.3. The finding of greater genetic diversity within the wild-type VNTR-8 lineage compared to VNTR-3 suggests that VNTR-8 may be older within the European population. However, in the absence of a more extensive STR data-set, no such conclusions are possible for the respective R408W mutant lineages.	3
The molecular basis of phenylketonuria in Lithuania. ||  || We report the spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) residing in Lithuania. A total of 184 independent chromosomes was investigated. R408W mutation was first analysed through restriction enzyme digestion of exon 12. The remaining uncharacterised PKU chromosomes were analysed by scanning the whole coding sequence of PAH gene by multiplex 'broad range' denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Mutations were identified by fluorescent automated sequencing or by restriction enzyme digestion analysis if an abnormal DGGE pattern was recognised. 21 different mutations were identified for 175 PKU chromosomes, with a mutation detection rate of 95%. The most common ones were R408W (73.5% chromosomes) and R158Q (7.0% chromosomes) whereas the remaining mutations appeared to be rare (relative frequencies 0.5%-2%). The high mutation detection rate obtained is an evidence of the efficiency of PAH genetic testing achieved in Lithuania. Moreover, the definition of the PKU mutation profile in the Lithuanian population will allow to perform a genotype-phenotype correlation study thus making feasible genotyped-based prediction of the biochemical phenotype in newborns with hyperphenylalaninemia. This may be useful for refining diagnosis and anticipating dietary requirements.	1 3
Contribution of connexin 26 mutations to nonsyndromic deafness in Ashkenazi patients and the variable phenotypic effect of the mutation 167delT. || Alleles Child Connexin 26 Connexins DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Family Health Gene Frequency Genetic Variation Genotype Humans Jews Mutation Phenotype Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Sequence Deletion || Twenty-seven unrelated Jewish Ashkenazi patients with nonsyndromic prelingual deafness (NSD) were analyzed for mutations in the coding sequence of the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene. Biallelic mutations were identified in 19 of the 27 patients (70.4%); 12 were homozygous for the mutation 167delT, 2 were homozygous for the mutation 35delG, and 5 were compound 167delT/35delG heterozygotes. In addition three patients were heterozygous with no second identified mutation in the Cx26 gene. Biallelic mutations in the Cx26 gene account for 83% of familial cases and 44% of the sporadic cases. Among 268 unselected Ashkenazi individuals, 20 were 167delT/N heterozygotes, giving an estimate of 7.5% carrier frequency. Based on the 167delT carrier frequency in three studies (including the present one), it is expected that 167delT/167delT homozygotes account for 70% of all patients with NSD (1 in 1300). The hearing capacity of 30 patients (probands and their sibs) with biallelic Cx26 mutations and at least one allele with 167delT demonstrated inter- and intrafamilial variability from profound to mild hearing impairment.	4
The molecular basis of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in Croatia. ||  || We present the results of a comprehensive analysis of mutations, polymorphisms and haplotypes in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in 39 Croatian families with phenylketonuria (PKU). A total of 21 disease-causing mutations was identified on 78 out of 79 independent chromosomes. The commonest mutation, R408W on haplotype 2 was found with a relative frequency of 37 %. P281L accounted for 11 %, R261Q and E390G each for 9 % of mutant chromosomes. There were three novel mutations: L249P (c.746T>C) in exon 7, IVS8+2T>C (c.912T>C) in intron 8, and F402L (c.1206T>G) in exon 12 of the PAH gene. Two known PKU mutations were found in cis on the same chromosome in one family, highlighting the need to perform full mutation scanning in recessive disease genes for molecular diagnosis even if two known mutations have been identified in a patient. This is the first comprehensive report on PKU mutations in southeastern Europe, adding to the growing bulk of molecular data for population genetic investigations.	3
Diagnostic outcomes of exome sequencing in patients with syndromic or non-syndromic hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Female Genotype Hearing Loss Humans Male Phenotype Syndrome Whole Exome Sequencing Young Adult || Hereditary hearing loss (HL) is a common sensory disorder, with an incidence of 1-2 per 1000 newborns, and has a genetic etiology in over 50% of cases. It occurs either as part of a syndrome or in isolation and is genetically very heterogeneous which poses a challenge for clinical and molecular diagnosis. We used exome sequencing to seek a genetic cause in a group of 56 subjects (49 probands) with HL: 32 with non-syndromic non-GJB2 HL and 17 with syndromic HL. Following clinical examination and clinical exome sequencing, an etiological diagnosis was established in 15 probands (15/49; 30%); eight (8/17;47%) from the syndromic group and seven (7/32; 21%) from the non-syndromic non-GJB2 subgroup. Fourteen different (half of them novel) non-GJB2 variants causing HL were found in 10 genes (CHD7, HDAC8, MITF, NEFL, OTOF, SF3B4, SLC26A4, TECTA, TMPRSS3, USH2A) among 13 probands, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of hereditary HL. Different genetic causes for HL were found in a single family while three probands with apparent syndromic HL were found to have HL as a separate clinical feature, distinct from the complex phenotype. Clinical exome sequencing proved to be an effective tool used to comprehensively address the genetic heterogeneity of HL, to detect clinically unrecognized HL syndromes, and to decipher complex phenotypes in which HL is a separate feature and not part of a syndrome.	4
The molecular basis of phenylketonuria in Latvia. ||  || Characterization of the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in Latvia has been accomplished through the analysis of 96 unrelated chromosomes from 50 Latvian PKU patients. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations have been analyzed through a combined approach in which R158Q, R252W, R261Q, G272X, IVS10-11G>A and R408W mutations were first screened for by PCR or restriction generating PCR amplification of PAH gene exons 5, 7, 11 and 12 followed by digestion with the appropriate diagnostic enzyme. Subsequently 'broad range' denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the 13 PAH gene exons has been used to study uncharacterized PKU chromosomes. A mutation detection rate of 98% was achieved. 12 different mutations were found, with the most frequent mutation, R408W, accounting for 76% of Latvian PKU alleles. Six mutations (R408W, E280K, R158Q, A104D, R261Q and P281L) represent 92% of PKU chromosomes. PAH VNTR and STR alleles have been also identified and minihaplotype associations with PKU mutations were also determined.	1 3
Genetic screening of Russian Usher syndrome patients toward selection for gene therapy. || MYO7A Russian cohort USH2A Usher syndrome gene therapy || Usher syndrome (USH) is heterogeneous in nature and requires genetic test for diagnosis and management. Mutations in USH associated genes are reported in some populations except Russians. Here, we first time represented the mutation spectrum of a Russian USH cohort. Twenty-eight patients with USH were selected from 3214 patients from Deaf-Blind Support Foundation "Con-nection" during 2014-2016 following the observational study NCT03319524. Complete ophthalmologic, ENT, and vestibular medical tests were done for clinical characterization. NGS, MLPA, and Sanger sequencing were considered for genetic analysis. Around 53.57% and 39.28% patients had USH1 and USH2, respectively; 17.85% cases (n = 5/28) had no known mutation. Eleven (73.33%) subjects showed variations in USH1 associated genes MYO7A (72.72%), CDH23 (9.09%), PCDH15 (9.09%), and USH1C (9.09%). Eleven mutations are detected in MYO7A where 54.54% are novel. MYO7A: p.Q18* was most frequent (27.27%) mutation and is associated with early manifestation and most severe clinical picture. Two novel mutations (p.E1301* and c.158-?_318+?del) are detected in PCDH15 gene. Around 90.90% patients suspected to be USH2 are confirmed by genetic testing. Eleven mutations detected in the USH2A gene, where 27.27% were novel. Most common USH2A mutation is p.W3955* (50%) followed by p.E767fs, p.R1653*, and c.8682-9A> G (20% each). The Russian USH cohort shows both novel and known USH mutations. Clinically the prevalence of USH2 is low (39.28%) and the frequency of MYO7A mutations responsible for USH1B is very high (63.63%, N = 7/11) compared to other cohorts. These seven patients carrying MYO7A mutations are preliminarily eligible for the UshStat® gene therapy.	4
CpG hotspot causes second mutation in codon 408 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. || Codon Dinucleoside Phosphates Humans Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid || A new mutation has been identified in exon 12 of the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase at codon 408. The single base change from guanine to adenine changes the amino acid arginine to glutamine; thus, the mutation is defined as R408Q. This codon is the site of a mutation known to causes phenylketonuria. Both these mutations are located at the same CpG site.	3
Loss of p53 enhances the function of the endoplasmic reticulum through activation of the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor DNA-Binding Proteins Endoplasmic Reticulum Endoribonucleases HCT116 Cells Heterografts Humans Male Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Nude Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors Signal Transduction Sulfonamides Thiophenes Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases X-Box Binding Protein 1 || Altered regulation of ER stress response has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, such as cancer and metabolic diseases. Excessive ER function contributes to malignant phenotypes, such as chemoresistance and metastasis. Here we report that the tumor suppressor p53 regulates ER function in response to stress. We found that loss of p53 function activates the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway to enhance protein folding and secretion through upregulation of IRE1α and subsequent activation of its target XBP1. We also show that wild-type p53 interacts with synoviolin (SYVN1)/HRD1/DER3, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase localized to ER during ER stress and removes unfolded proteins by reversing transport to the cytosol from the ER, and its interaction stimulates IRE1α degradation. Moreover, IRE1α inhibitor suppressed protein secretion, induced cell death in p53-deficient cells, and strongly suppressed the formation of tumors by p53-deficient human tumor cells in vivo compared with those that expressed wild-type p53. Therefore, our data imply that the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway serves as a target for therapy of chemoresistant tumors that express mutant p53.	0
R248Q mutation--Beyond p53-DNA binding. || Arginine DNA Humans Hydrogen Bonding Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Models, Molecular Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Protein Conformation Protein Domains Thermodynamics Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || R248 in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 interacts directly with the minor groove of DNA. Earlier nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicated that the R248Q mutation resulted in conformation changes in parts of DBD far from the mutation site. However, how information propagates from the mutation site to the rest of the DBD is still not well understood. We performed a series of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to dissect sterics and charge effects of R248 on p53-DBD conformation: (i) wild-type p53 DBD; (ii) p53 DBD with an electrically neutral arginine side-chain; (iii) p53 DBD with R248A; (iv) p53 DBD with R248W; and (v) p53 DBD with R248Q. Our results agree well with experimental observations of global conformational changes induced by the R248Q mutation. Our simulations suggest that both charge- and sterics are important in the dynamics of the loop (L3) where the mutation resides. We show that helix 2 (H2) dynamics is altered as a result of a change in the hydrogen bonding partner of D281. In turn, neighboring L1 dynamics is altered: in mutants, L1 predominantly adopts the recessed conformation and is unable to interact with the major groove of DNA. We focused our attention the R248Q mutant that is commonly found in a wide range of cancer and observed changes at the zinc-binding pocket that might account for the dominant negative effects of R248Q. Furthermore, in our simulations, the S6/S7 turn was more frequently solvent exposed in R248Q, suggesting that there is a greater tendency of R248Q to partially unfold and possibly lead to an increased aggregation propensity. Finally, based on the observations made in our simulations, we propose strategies for the rescue of R248Q mutants.	0
Low frequency of Fabry disease in patients with common heart disease. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Comorbidity DNA Fabry Disease Female Heart Diseases Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Trihexosylceramides alpha-Galactosidase || To test the hypothesis that undiagnosed patients with Fabry disease exist among patients affected by common heart disease. Globotriaosylceramide in random whole urine using tandem mass spectroscopy, α-galactosidase A activity in dried blood spots, and next-generation sequencing of pooled or individual genomic DNA samples supplemented by Sanger sequencing. We tested 2,256 consecutive patients: 852 women (median age 65 years (19-95)) and 1,404 men (median age 65 years (21-92)). The primary diagnoses were coronary artery disease (n = 994), arrhythmia (n = 607), cardiomyopathy (n = 138), and valvular disease (n = 568). Urinary globotriaosylceramide was elevated in 15% of patients and 15 males had low α-galactosidase A activity. GLA variants found included R118C (n = 2), D83N, and D313Y (n = 7); IVS6-22 C>T, IVS4-16 A>G, IVS2+990C>A, 5'UTR-10 C>T (n = 4), IVS1-581 C>T, IVS1-1238 G>A, 5'UTR-30 G>A, IVS2+590C>T, IVS0-12 G>A, IVS4+68A>G, IVS0-10 C>T, IVS2-81-77delCAGCC, IVS2-77delC. Although the pathogenicity of several of these missense mutations and complex intronic haplotypes has been controversial, none of the patients screened in this study were diagnosed definitively with Fabry disease. This population of patients with common heart disease did not contain a substantial number of patients with undiagnosed Fabry disease. GLA gene sequencing is superior to urinary globotriaosylceramide or α-galactosidase A activity in the screening for Fabry disease.	4
A recurrent truncating germline mutation in the BRIP1/FANCJ gene and susceptibility to prostate cancer. || Age of Onset Aged Case-Control Studies DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome-Wide Association Study Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Prognosis Prostatic Neoplasms RNA Helicases || Although prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the most common cancers in men in Western countries, little is known about the inherited factors that influence PrCa risk. On the basis of the fact that BRIP1/FANCJ interacts with BRCA1 and functions as a regulator of DNA double-strand break repair pathways, and that germline mutations within the BRIP1/FANCJ gene predispose to breast cancer, we chose this gene as a candidate for mutation screening in familial and young-onset PrCa cases. We identified a truncating mutation, R798X, in the BRIP1/FANCJ gene in 4 out of 2714 UK PrCa cases enriched for familial (2 out of 641; 0.3%) and young-onset cases (2 out of 2073; 0.1%). On screening 2045 controls from the UK population, we found one R798X sequence alteration (0.05%; odds ratio 2.4 (95% CI 0.25-23.4)). In addition, using our data from a genome-wide association study, we analysed 25 SNPs in the genomic region of the BRIP1/FANCJ gene. Two SNPs showed evidence of association with familial and young-onset PrCa (rs6504074; P(trend)=0.04 and rs8076727; P(trend)=0.01). These results suggest that truncating mutations in BRIP1/FANCJ might confer an increased risk of PrCa and common SNPs might also contribute to the alteration of risk, but larger case-control series will be required to confirm or refute this association.	4
Subacute onset leukodystrophy and visual-spatial disorders revealing phenylketonuria combined with homocysteinmia in adulthood: A case report. || Folic Acid Humans Hyperhomocysteinemia Leukoencephalopathies Male Mutation Phenylketonurias Vision Disorders Vitamin B 12 Vitamin B 6 Vitamin B Complex Young Adult || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder, which manifests a progressive irreversible neurological impairment during infancy and childhood. Hyperhomocysteinemia also showed that it might be involved in pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. The late-onset clinical manifestations of these 2 diseases have not been reported elsewhere. We speculated that the late-onset PKU is caused by 2 kinds of metabolic dysfunction synergistically, especially a short period of irregular diet directly caused clinical symptoms. A 21-year old Asian male patient demonstrated subacute leukodystrophy and visual-spatial disorders of late onset in adulthood. Phenylketonuria combined with homocysteinmia, who presented with heterozygous mutations in gene encoding PAH p.G247R (c.739G>C) and p.Y204C (c.611A>G), along with homozygous mutation of gene encoding MTHFR c.677C>T. The patient was treated with cobalamine (500 μg/day), vitamin B6 (30 mg/day), folate (5 mg/day) and encouraged to follow a protein-restricted diet. Visual disorientation and cognitive function showed improvement. Head MR showed similar resolution with the original lesion. Serum homocysteine and folate analysis were normal with decreased phenylalanine level. This case suggests that neurological involvement of progressive nervous system dysfunction could be caused by more than one kind of inherited metabolic disturbances, and each one can induce or deteriorate the manifestations of another metabolic disorders.	1 3
Personalized oncology through integrative high-throughput sequencing: a pilot study. || Animals Base Sequence Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Mice Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Neoplasms Pilot Projects Precision Medicine || Individual cancers harbor a set of genetic aberrations that can be informative for identifying rational therapies currently available or in clinical trials. We implemented a pilot study to explore the practical challenges of applying high-throughput sequencing in clinical oncology. We enrolled patients with advanced or refractory cancer who were eligible for clinical trials. For each patient, we performed whole-genome sequencing of the tumor, targeted whole-exome sequencing of tumor and normal DNA, and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the tumor to identify potentially informative mutations in a clinically relevant time frame of 3 to 4 weeks. With this approach, we detected several classes of cancer mutations including structural rearrangements, copy number alterations, point mutations, and gene expression alterations. A multidisciplinary Sequencing Tumor Board (STB) deliberated on the clinical interpretation of the sequencing results obtained. We tested our sequencing strategy on human prostate cancer xenografts. Next, we enrolled two patients into the clinical protocol and were able to review the results at our STB within 24 days of biopsy. The first patient had metastatic colorectal cancer in which we identified somatic point mutations in NRAS, TP53, AURKA, FAS, and MYH11, plus amplification and overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8). The second patient had malignant melanoma, in which we identified a somatic point mutation in HRAS and a structural rearrangement affecting CDKN2C. The STB identified the CDK8 amplification and Ras mutation as providing a rationale for clinical trials with CDK inhibitors or MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibitors, respectively. Integrative high-throughput sequencing of patients with advanced cancer generates a comprehensive, individual mutational landscape to facilitate biomarker-driven clinical trials in oncology.	4
Comparative sequencing analysis reveals high genomic concordance between matched primary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Alcohol Oxidoreductases Colorectal Neoplasms Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genome, Human HEK293 Cells High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Neoplasm Metastasis Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Sequence Analysis, DNA ras Proteins || Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with over 50,000 deaths estimated in 2014. Molecular profiling for somatic mutations that predict absence of response to anti-EGFR therapy has become standard practice in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer; however, the quantity and type of tissue available for testing is frequently limited. Further, the degree to which the primary tumor is a faithful representation of metastatic disease has been questioned. As next-generation sequencing technology becomes more widely available for clinical use and additional molecularly targeted agents are considered as treatment options in colorectal cancer, it is important to characterize the extent of tumor heterogeneity between primary and metastatic tumors. We performed deep coverage, targeted next-generation sequencing of 230 key cancer-associated genes for 69 matched primary and metastatic tumors and normal tissue. Mutation profiles were 100% concordant for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF, and were highly concordant for recurrent alterations in colorectal cancer. Additionally, whole genome sequencing of four patient trios did not reveal any additional site-specific targetable alterations. Colorectal cancer primary tumors and metastases exhibit high genomic concordance. As current clinical practices in colorectal cancer revolve around KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutation status, diagnostic sequencing of either primary or metastatic tissue as available is acceptable for most patients. Additionally, consistency between targeted sequencing and whole genome sequencing results suggests that targeted sequencing may be a suitable strategy for clinical diagnostic applications.	4
Impact of consanguineous marriages in GJB2-related hearing loss in the Iranian population: a report of a novel variant. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group Connexin 26 Connexins Consanguinity Female Gene Frequency Genes, Recessive Genetic Variation Hearing Loss Humans Iran Male Mutation || Mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 genes are the main causes of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in many populations. Here, we investigated GJB2 and GJB6 mutations in 114 patients from 77 affected ARNSHL families including 54 consanguineous marriages and 23 nonrelative marriages in the Iranian population. Clinical studies and genetic counseling were performed for all families. GJB2 and GJB6 genes were directly sequenced. Three known GJB6 large deletions [del(GJB6-D13S1830), del(GJB6-D13S1854), and a 920 kb deletion] were also checked by quantification of a common deleted region within the GJB6 gene. The frequency of consanguinity was 70.13% among the studied families. Biallelic GJB2 mutations were 16.67% in consanguineous marriages and 4.35% in nonrelative marriages. Mutations found were 35delG, delE120, R127H, M163V, W24X, V37I, G12D, V84A, 313-326del14, and E110K. The latter was a novel variant. Neither point mutation nor a large deletion in the GJB6 gene was found in the population. Mean frequency of GJB2 mutations was 17.92%. GJB2 mutations (and not GJB6 mutations) are the major causes of hearing loss in Iran. The role of consanguineous marriages is also highlighted in occurrence of GJB2-related hearing loss. We suggest that other genes may be involved in the population.	4
Validating predicted biological effects of Alzheimer's disease associated SNPs using CSF biomarker levels. ||  || Recent large-scale genetic studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have identified risk variants in CALHM1, GAB2, and SORL1. The mechanisms by which these genes might modulate risk are not definitively known. CALHM1 and SORL1 may alter amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and GAB2 may influence phosphorylation of the tau protein. In this study we have analyzed disease associated genetic variants in each of these genes for association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ or tau levels in 602 samples from two independent CSF series. We failed to detect association between CSF Aβ42 levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms in SORL1 despite substantial statistical power to detect association. While we also failed to detect association between variants in GAB2 and CSF tau levels, power to detect this association was limited. Finally, our data suggest that the minor allele of rs2986017, in CALHM1, is marginally associated with CSF Aβ42 levels. This association is consistent with previous reports that this non-synonymous coding substitution results in increased Aβ levels in vitro and provides support for an Aβ-related mechanism for modulating risk for Alzheimer's disease.	4
High prevalences of carriers of the 35delG mutation of connexin 26 in the Mediterranean area. || Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Genetic Carrier Screening Genomics Genotype Humans Mediterranean Region Point Mutation Prevalence || Mutation 35delG in the connexin 26 gene is the main cause of recessive deafness in Europe. The prevalence of carriers varies, with a mean value proportion of 1/31 in Mediterranean countries. The aim of this study is to determinate the percentage of carriers in seven populations of the Mediterranean area and to compare prevalence of the mutation in seventeen other published populations in the same area. This study has been carried out on the genomic DNAs out of a total of 886 healthy subjects, originating from Sevilla (Spain), Genoa, Sicily (Italy), Alexandria (Egypt), Libya, Algier (Algeria) and Tangier (Morocco), genotyped by Taqman assay. The approximate proportions of the 35delG mutation are <1/149 in Sevilla, 1/129 in Genoa, 1/34 in Sicily, 1/54 in Alexandria, 1/41 in Libya, 1/141 in Algier and 1/123 in Tangier. When compared to other Mediterranean populations, the mean prevalence of the mutation is 1/49. One of the most elevated values of 35delG prevalence corresponds to Greece (1/28); the pattern of various 35delG prevalences is interpretated in the present meta-analysis as the result of Ancient Greek colonizations of the "Magna Grecia" in historical times.	4
microRNA-34a promotes DNA damage and mitotic catastrophe. || Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor DNA Damage Down-Regulation Humans MicroRNAs Mitosis Mutation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Efficient and error-free DNA repair is critical for safeguarding genome integrity, yet it is also linked to radio- and chemoresistance of malignant tumors. miR-34a, a potent tumor suppressor, influences a large set of p53-regulated genes and contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis. However, the effects of miR-34a on the processes of DNA damage and repair are not entirely understood. We explored tet-inducible miR-34a-expressing human p53 wild-type and R273H p53 mutant GBM cell lines, and found that miR-34a influences the broad spectrum of 53BP1-mediated DNA damage response. It escalates both post-irradiation and endogenous DNA damage, abrogates radiation-induced G 2/M arrest and drastically increases the number of irradiated cells undergoing mitotic catastrophe. Furthermore, miR-34a downregulates 53BP1 and inhibits its recruitment to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks. We conclude that whereas miR-34a counteracts DNA repair, it also contributes to the p53-independent elimination of distressed cells, thus preventing the rise of genomic instability in tumor cell populations. These properties of miR-34a can potentially be exploited for DNA damage-effecting therapies of malignancies.	0
Fetal-juvenile origins of point mutations in the adult human tracheal-bronchial epithelium: absence of detectable effects of age, gender or smoking status. || Adolescent Adult Aged Bronchi Cell Line Female Fetus Genes, p53 Genes, ras Humans Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase Male Middle Aged Point Mutation Respiratory Mucosa Smoking Trachea || Allele-specific mismatch amplification mutation assays (MAMA) of anatomically distinct sectors of the upper bronchial tracts of nine nonsmokers revealed many numerically dispersed clusters of the point mutations C742T, G746T, G747T of the TP53 gene, G35T of the KRAS gene and G508A of the HPRT1 gene. Assays of these five mutations in six smokers have yielded quantitatively similar results. One hundred and eighty four micro-anatomical sectors of 0.5-6x10(6) tracheal-bronchial epithelial cells represented en toto the equivalent of approximately 1.7 human smokers' bronchial trees to the fifth bifurcation. Statistically significant mutant copy numbers above the 95% upper confidence limits of historical background controls were found in 198 of 425 sector assays. No significant differences (P=0.1) for negative sector fractions, mutant fractions, distributions of mutant cluster size or anatomical positions were observed for smoking status, gender or age (38-76 year). Based on the modal cluster size of mitochondrial point mutants, the size of the adult bronchial epithelial maintenance turnover unit was estimated to be about 32 cells. When data from all 15 lungs were combined the log2 of nuclear mutant cluster size plotted against log2 of the number of clusters of a given cluster size displayed a slope of approximately 1.1 over a range of cluster sizes from approximately 2(6) to 2(15) mutant copies. A parsimonious interpretation of these nuclear and previously reported data for lung epithelial mitochondrial point mutant clusters is that they arose from mutations in stem cells at a high but constant rate per stem cell doubling during at least ten stem cell doublings of the later fetal-juvenile period. The upper and lower decile range of summed point mutant fractions among lungs was about 7.5-fold, suggesting an important source of stratification in the population with regard to risk of tumor initiation.	4
Cellular interplay via cytokine hierarchy causes pathological cardiac hypertrophy in RAF1-mutant Noonan syndrome. || Alleles Animals Coculture Techniques Cytokines Disease Models, Animal Fibroblasts Fibrosis Gene Knock-In Techniques Humans Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular Interleukin-6 MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Mice Mice, Transgenic Mutation Myocardium Myocytes, Cardiac Noonan Syndrome Primary Cell Culture Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha || Noonan syndrome (NS) is caused by mutations in RAS/ERK pathway genes, and is characterized by craniofacial, growth, cognitive and cardiac defects. NS patients with kinase-activating RAF1 alleles typically develop pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is reproduced in Raf1L613V/+ knock-in mice. Here, using inducible Raf1L613V expression, we show that LVH results from the interplay of cardiac cell types. Cardiomyocyte Raf1L613V enhances Ca2+ sensitivity and cardiac contractility without causing hypertrophy. Raf1L613V expression in cardiomyocytes or activated fibroblasts exacerbates pressure overload-evoked fibrosis. Endothelial/endocardial (EC) Raf1L613V causes cardiac hypertrophy without affecting contractility. Co-culture and neutralizing antibody experiments reveal a cytokine (TNF/IL6) hierarchy in Raf1L613V-expressing ECs that drives cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Furthermore, postnatal TNF inhibition normalizes the increased wall thickness and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo. We conclude that NS-cardiomyopathy involves cardiomyocytes, ECs and fibroblasts, TNF/IL6 signalling components represent potential therapeutic targets, and abnormal EC signalling might contribute to other forms of LVH.	0
Misdiagnosis of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome in a Patient With Clonal Hematopoiesis and a Somatic TP53 Mutation. ||  || Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare genetic disorder that confers a high risk of developing certain malignancies at a young age. It is caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene and is typically diagnosed by sequencing this gene in blood cells. The presence of a mutation in approximately half of the DNA reads (allelic fraction of 50%) is an indicator of a germline mutation, such as that in LFS. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an expansion of a hematopoietic clone containing a somatic driver mutation with a low allelic fraction, usually not more than 10% to 20%. This report presents a patient with fallopian tube carcinoma who underwent multigene panel testing for cancer predisposition and was found to have a mutation in theTP53 gene, c.733G>T (p.Gly245Cys). Since theTP53 mutation had an allelic fraction of approximately 50%, it was interpreted as being germline, and the patient was diagnosed as having LFS. A year later, she developed acute myelogenous leukemia. Subsequent mutational analysis showed that theTP53 mutation was absent in her benign tissue sample but present in leukemic cells. Furthermore, sequencing of the fallopian tube tumor tissue revealed a differentTP53 gene mutation, c.818G>T (p.Arg273Leu). These observations confirmed that the previously identified mutation in her blood was somatic rather than germline and that she had CH at the time of genetic testing. CH can occasionally lead to a misdiagnosis of a germline mutation and a cancer predisposition syndrome that has significant implications for patients and their families. Therefore, the abnormal result of genetic testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility should be carefully interpreted when the clinical presentation is atypical, when the patient is older, when the gene in question is known to have potential germline and somatic mutations such as theTP53 gene, and when the allelic fraction is approximately 50%.	4
Association of TMTC2 With Human Nonsyndromic Sensorineural Hearing Loss. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carrier Proteins Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 Disease Progression European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genes, Dominant Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Hearing Loss, Bilateral Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Prospective Studies Young Adult || Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is commonly caused by conditions that affect cochlear structures or the auditory nerve, and the genes identified as causing SNHL to date only explain a fraction of the overall genetic risk for this debilitating disorder. It is likely that other genes and mutations also cause SNHL. To identify a candidate gene that causes bilateral, symmetric, progressive SNHL in a large multigeneration family of Northern European descent. In this prospective genotype and phenotype study performed from January 1, 2006, through April 1, 2016, a 6-generation family of Northern European descent with 19 individuals having reported early-onset hearing loss suggestive of an autosomal dominant inheritance were studied at a tertiary academic medical center. In addition, 179 unrelated adult individuals with SNHL and 186 adult individuals reporting nondeafness were examined. Sensorineural hearing loss. Nine family members (5 women [55.6%]) provided clinical audiometric and medical records that documented hearing loss. The hearing loss is characterized as bilateral, symmetric, progressive SNHL that reached severe to profound loss in childhood. Audiometric configurations demonstrated a characteristic dip at 1000 to 2000 Hz. All affected family members wear hearing aids or have undergone cochlear implantation. Exome sequencing and linkage and association analyses identified a fully penetrant sequence variant (rs35725509) on chromosome 12q21 (logarithm of odds, 3.3) in the TMTC2 gene region that segregates with SNHL in this family. This gene explains the SNHL occurrence in this family. The variant is also associated with SNHL in a cohort of 363 unrelated individuals (179 patients with confirmed SNHL and 184 controls, P = 7 × 10-4). A previously uncharacterized gene, TMTC2, has been identified as a candidate for causing progressive SNHL in humans. This finding identifies a novel locus that causes autosomal dominant SNHL and therefore a more detailed understanding of the genetic basis of SNHL. Because TMTC2 has not been previously reported to regulate auditory function, the discovery reveals a potentially new, uncharacterized mechanism of hearing loss.	4
TERTp mutation is associated with a shorter progression free survival in patients with aggressive histology subtypes of follicular-cell derived thyroid carcinoma. || Adenocarcinoma, Follicular Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Disease Progression Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis Progression-Free Survival Promoter Regions, Genetic Telomerase Thyroid Neoplasms Time Factors Young Adult || Evaluate the impact of TERTp mutation on the outcomes after initial treatment of 45 patients with thyroid carcinomas derived from follicular cells (TCDFC) with aggressive histology, in which the role of this mutation is not yet well defined. Analysis of the presence of TERTp (-124C > T and -146C > T), BRAF (V600E), and NRAS (Q 61R) mutations by Sanger sequencing and analysis of their correlation with the patient's outcomes. Forty-five patients with aggressive histopathologic variants were included in the study. Of these, 68.9% had aggressive variants of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 22.2% had poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC)/insular carcinoma, and 8.9% had invasive follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) with Hurthle cell features (Hurthle cell carcinoma). Lymph node metastases were present in 46.7% and distant metastases in 54.6%. The response to the initial therapy was excellent in 45.5% and structurally incomplete in 50%. During the follow-up period (median of 56 months; 5-360 months), 47.7% presented with disease progression and 17.8% experienced disease-related death. In 53.3% of the cases at least one molecular alteration (TERTp in 33.4%, BRAF in 24.5%, RAS in 8.9%) was detected. In the multivariate analysis, TERTp mutation was the factor associated with the highest risk (6 times) of having structural disease after initial therapy (p = 0.01), followed by vascular invasion (p = 0.02), gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) (p = 0.02) and distant metastasis (p = 0.04). Regarding mutational status, only TERTp mutation was associated with disease progression, and diminished disease progression-free survival (PFS). The presence of distant metastasis, vascular invasion and gross ETE were significantly associated with the risk of disease progression. TERTp mutation appears be an indicator of both persistence and progression of structural disease after initial therapy in aggressive variants of TCDFC, and associates with a shorter progression free survival regardless of the therapy employed.	4
Tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin and its role in normal and malignant cells. ||  || E-cadherin tumor suppressor genes are particularly active area of research in development and tumorigenesis. The calcium-dependent interactions among E-cadherin molecules are critical for the formation and maintenance of adherent junctions in areas of epithelial cell-cell contact. Loss of E-cadherin-mediated-adhesion characterises the transition from benign lesions to invasive, metastatic cancer. Nevertheless, there is evidence that E-cadherins may also play a role in the wnt signal transduction pathway, together with other key molecules involved in it, such as beta-catenins and adenomatous poliposis coli gene products.The structure and function of E-cadherin, gene and protein, in normal as well as in tumor cells are reviewed in this paper.	0
Mutation-Specific Phenotypes in hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Carrying Either Myosin-Binding Protein C Or α-Tropomyosin Mutation for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. ||  || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic cardiac disease, which affects the structure of heart muscle tissue. The clinical symptoms include arrhythmias, progressive heart failure, and even sudden cardiac death but the mutation carrier can also be totally asymptomatic. To date, over 1400 mutations have been linked to HCM, mostly in genes encoding for sarcomeric proteins. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease are still largely unknown. Two founder mutations for HCM in Finland are located in myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3-Gln1061X) and α-tropomyosin (TPM1-Asp175Asn) genes. We studied the properties of HCM cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying either MYBPC3-Gln1061X or TPM1-Asp175Asn mutation. Both types of HCM-CMs displayed pathological phenotype of HCM but, more importantly, we found differences between CMs carrying either MYBPC3-Gln1061X or TPM1-Asp175Asn gene mutation in their cellular size, Ca(2+) handling, and electrophysiological properties, as well as their gene expression profiles. These findings suggest that even though the clinical phenotypes of the patients carrying either MYBPC3-Gln1061X or TPM1-Asp175Asn gene mutation are similar, the genetic background as well as the functional properties on the cellular level might be different, indicating that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the two mutations would be divergent as well.	4
[Phenotype of patients showing hearing impairment based on the 35delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene]. || Acoustic Impedance Tests Adolescent Adult Aged Audiometry, Pure-Tone Child Child, Preschool Chromosome Deletion Codon, Terminator Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Disease Progression Female Frameshift Mutation Genetic Carrier Screening Guanine Homozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Phenotype || Hereditary hearing impairment constitutes a heterogeneous class of disorders showing different patterns of inheritance and involving multiple genes. Mutations in the GJB2 gene, especially the 35delG mutation, have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic nonsyndromic hearing impairment in different populations. We analyzed 14 northeast Hungarian families and 69 sporadic cases with nonsyndromic hearing impairment for the 35delG mutation. Sixty-five patients showing a homozygous 35delG mutation were examined regarding their audiologic phenotype. In general, these patients (70%) showed a prelingual, sensorineural, bilateral, symmetric hearing impairment without progression. The audiograms demonstrated sloping as well as flat patterns. The severity of hearing impairment varied in 30% of all analyzed patients, making genetic counseling difficult.	4
Dual blockade of PKA and NF-κB inhibits H2 relaxin-mediated castrate-resistant growth of prostate cancer sublines and induces apoptosis. || Apoptosis Castration Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Separation Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Flow Cytometry Humans Immunoblotting Immunohistochemistry Male NF-kappa B Prostatic Neoplasms RNA, Small Interfering Relaxin Signal Transduction Tissue Array Analysis Transfection || We previously demonstrated that H2 relaxin (RLN2) facilitates castrate-resistant (CR) growth of prostate cancer (CaP) cells through PI3K/Akt/β-catenin-mediated activation of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway. As inhibition of this pathway caused only ~50% reduction in CR growth, the goal of the current study was to identify additional RLN2-activated pathways that contribute to CR growth. Next-generation sequencing-based transcriptome and gene ontology analyses comparing LNCaP stably transfected with RLN2 versus LNCaP-vector identified differential expression of genes associated with cell proliferation (12.7% of differentially expressed genes), including genes associated with the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathways. Subsequent molecular analyses confirmed that the cAMP/PKA and NF-κB pathways play a role in facilitating H2 relaxin-mediated CR growth of CaP cells. Inhibition of PKA-attenuated RLN2-mediated AR activity inhibited proliferation and caused a small but significant increase in apoptosis. Combined inhibition of the PKA and NF-κB signaling pathways via inhibition of PKA and Akt induced significant apoptosis and dramatically reduced clonogenic potential, outperforming docetaxel, the standard of care treatment for CR CaP. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays in combination with multispectral quantitative imaging comparing RLN2 levels in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and CaP determined that RLN2 is significantly upregulated in CaP vs BPH (p = 0.002). The combined data indicate RLN2 overexpression is frequent in CaP patients and provides a growth advantage to CaP cells. A near-complete inhibition of RLN2-induced CR growth can be achieved by simultaneous blockade of both pathways.	0
[Analysis of the deafness gene screening results from newborns in Shijiazhuang]. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Deafness Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation Neonatal Screening Polymerase Chain Reaction RNA, Ribosomal || To build information repository of the carrying rate of neonatal deafness gene in Shijiazhuang. Blood samples were collected from the heel in 3-days neonates. Mutations of the deafness related genes were detected by the method of fluorescent PCR. Neonates received the detection of 6 mutation sites from 3 genes, including GJB2 (235delC, 299-300delAT), SLC26A4 (IVS7-2A> G, 2168A> G), mitochondrial DNA12S rRNA(1494C>T,1555A>G). There were 384 neonates who carried mutations among 421 subjects and the carrying rate was 4.08%, 158 (1.68%) newborns carried heterozygous mutations and 1 (0.01%) case carried homogeneous mutation of GJB2 (235 delC), 55 (0.58%) neonates carried heterozygous mutations of GJB2 (299-300delAT); 133 (1.41%) neonates carried heterozygous mutations and 1 (0.01%) homogeneous of SLC26A4(IVS7-2A>G),19 (0.20%) newborns carried heterozygous mutations of SLC26A4 (2168A>G). The numbers of neonates who carried homogeneous and heterogeneous mutation of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene were 14 and 3 with carring rates of 0.15% and 0.03%. Two newborns were found to carry more than one mutation. One carried 235delC, IVS7-2A>G and 1555A>G and another carried 235delC and IVS7-2A>G. The main mutational patterns were 235delC from GJB2 gene and IVS7-2A>G from SLC26A4 gene in Shijiazhuang newborns. The carrying rate information repository of neonatal deafness gene has been built preliminarily.	4
Loss of functional E-cadherin renders cells more resistant to the apoptotic agent taxol in vitro. || Animals Apoptosis Blotting, Western CHO Cells Cadherins Cell Line Cell Survival Cricetinae Cricetulus Down-Regulation Flow Cytometry Formazans Mutation Paclitaxel Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Tetrazolium Salts Transfection || Experimental evidence supports a role for E-cadherin in suppressing invasion, metastasis, and proliferation. Germline mutations of the E-cadherin represent the genetic cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). In this type of tumor, isolated cancer cells permeate the basal membrane and paradoxically survive in the gastric wall in the absence of contact with neighbor epithelial cells or with the extracellular matrix. This suggests that upon E-cadherin deregulation, cells acquired resistance to apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, CHO cells stably expressing either wild-type E-cadherin or the HDGC-related germline mutations T340A and V832M were seeded either on a thin layer of collagen type I or on plastic and then subjected to the apoptotic agent taxol. We found that in vitro functional E-cadherin renders cells more sensitive to the effect of taxol. Our results also indicate that this effect is associated to decreased level of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein.	0
Screening of the ryanodine receptor gene in 105 malignant hyperthermia families: novel mutations and concordance with the in vitro contracture test. || Adult Amino Acid Substitution Child Codon DNA Mutational Analysis Fatal Outcome Female Gene Frequency Genetic Linkage Genetic Testing Genotype Germany Humans Male Malignant Hyperthermia Muscle Contraction Muscle Proteins Myopathy, Central Core Pedigree Phenotype Point Mutation Protein Structure, Tertiary Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel Sensitivity and Specificity || Malignant hyperthermia (MH) in man is an autosomal dominant disorder of skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-regulation. During anesthesia in predisposed individuals, it is triggered by volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. In >50% of the families, MH susceptibility is linked to the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1), the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, on chromosome 19q12-13.2. To date, 21 RYR1 mutations have been identified in a number of pedigrees. Four of them are also associated with central core disease (CCD), a congenital myopathy. Screening for these 21 mutations in 105 MH families including 10 CCD families phenotyped by the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) according to the European protocol revealed the following approximate distribution: 9% Arg-614-Cys, 1% Arg-614-Leu, 1% Arg-2163-Cys, 1% Val-2168-Met, 3% Thr-2206-Met and 7% Gly-2434-Arg. In one CCD family, the disease was caused by a recently reported MH mutation, Arg-2454-His. Two novel mutations, Thr-2206-Arg and Arg-2454-Cys were detected, each in a single pedigree. In the 109 individuals of the 25 families with RYR1 mutations cosegregation between genetic result and IVCT was almost perfect, only three genotypes were discordant with the IVCT phenotypes, suggesting a true sensitivity of 98.5% and a specificity of minimally 81.8% for this test. Screening of the transmembraneous region of RYR1 did not yield a new mutation confirming the cytosolic portion of the protein to be of main functional importance for disease pathogenesis.	4
Expression signature based on TP53 target genes doesn't predict response to TP53-MDM2 inhibitor in wild type TP53 tumors. || Antineoplastic Agents Cell Line Gene Expression Profiling Humans Neoplasms Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Regulon Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || A number of TP53-MDM2 inhibitors are currently under investigation as therapeutic agents in a variety of clinical trials in patients with TP53 wild type tumors. Not all wild type TP53 tumors are sensitive to such inhibitors. In an attempt to improve selection of patients with TP53 wild type tumors, an mRNA expression signature based on 13 TP53 transcriptional target genes was recently developed (Jeay et al. 2015). Careful reanalysis of TP53 status in the study validation data set of cancer cell lines considered to be TP53 wild type detected TP53 inactivating alterations in 23% of cell lines. The subsequent reanalysis of the remaining TP53 wild type cell lines clearly demonstrated that unfortunately the 13-gene signature cannot predict response to TP53-MDM2 inhibitor in TP53 wild type tumors.	0
Genetic causes of moderate to severe hearing loss point to modifiers. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Exome Female Genes, Recessive Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Hearing Loss, Sensorineural High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || The genetic underpinnings of recessively inherited moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss are not well understood, despite its higher prevalence in comparison to profound deafness. We recruited 92 consanguineous families segregating stable or progressive, recessively inherited moderate or severe hearing loss. We utilized homozygosity mapping, Sanger sequencing, targeted capture of known deafness genes with massively parallel sequencing and whole exome sequencing to identify the molecular basis of hearing loss in these families. Variants of the known deafness genes were found in 69% of the participating families with the SLC26A4, GJB2, MYO15A, TMC1, TMPRSS3, OTOF, MYO7A and CLDN14 genes together accounting for hearing loss in 54% of the families. We identified 20 reported and 21 novel variants in 21 known deafness genes; 16 of the 20 reported variants, previously associated with stable, profound deafness were associated with moderate to severe or progressive hearing loss in our families. These data point to a prominent role for genetic background, environmental factors or both as modifiers of human hearing loss severity.	4
Novel mutations and their genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with Noonan syndrome, using next-generation sequencing. || Genetic Association Studies High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Iran Models, Molecular Mutation Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 || Noonan Syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with many variable and heterogeneous conditions. The genetic basis for 20-30% of cases is still unknown. This study evaluates Iranian Noonan patients both clinically and genetically for the first time. Mutational analysis of PTPN11 gene was performed in 15 Iranian patients, using PCR and Sanger sequencing at phase one. Then, as phase two, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in the form of targeted resequencing was utilized for analysis of exons from other related genes. Homology modelling for the novel founded mutations was performed as well. The genotype, phenotype correlation was done according to the molecular findings and clinical features. Previously reported mutation (p.N308D) in some patients and a novel mutation (p.D155N) in one of the patients were identified in phase one. After applying NGS methods, known and new variants were found in four patients in other genes, including: CBL (p. V904I), KRAS (p. L53W), SOS1 (p. I1302V), and SOS1 (p. R552G). Structural studies of two deduced novel mutations in related genes revealed deficiencies in the mutated proteins. Following genotype, phenotype correlation, a new pattern of the presence of intellectual disability in two patients was registered. NS shows strong variable expressivity along the high genetic heterogeneity especially in distinct populations and ethnic groups. Also possibly unknown other causative genes may be exist. Obviously, more comprehensive and new technologies like NGS methods are the best choice for detection of molecular defects in patients for genotype, phenotype correlation and disease management.	4
AKAP-scaffolding proteins and regulation of cardiac physiology. || A Kinase Anchor Proteins Animals Dimerization Heart Humans Mice Mice, Knockout Myocardium || A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) compose a growing list of diverse but functionally related proteins defined by their ability to bind to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. AKAPs perform an integral role in the spatiotemporal modulation of a multitude of cellular signaling pathways. This review highlights the extensive role of AKAPs in cardiac excitation/contraction coupling and cardiac physiology. The literature shows that particular AKAPs are involved in cardiac Ca(2+) influx, release, reuptake, and myocyte repolarization. Studies have also suggested roles for AKAPs in cardiac remodeling. Transgenic studies show functional effects of AKAPs, not only in the cardiovascular system but in other organ systems as well.	0
Cardiovascular abnormalities in late-onset Pompe disease and response to enzyme replacement therapy. || Adult Age of Onset Cardiovascular Abnormalities Double-Blind Method Echocardiography Electrocardiography Enzyme Replacement Therapy Female Follow-Up Studies Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged Treatment Outcome alpha-Glucosidases || We evaluated the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities and the efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapy in patients with late-onset Pompe disease. Ninety patients were randomized 2:1 to enzyme replacement therapy or placebo in a double-blinded protocol. Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and scheduled intervals during the 78-week study period. Baseline cardiovascular abnormalities, and efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapy were described. Three pediatric patients were excluded. Eighty-seven patients were included. Median age was 44 years; 51% were men. At baseline, a short PR interval was present in 10%, 7% had decreased left ventricular systolic function, and 5% had elevated left ventricular mass on echocardiogram (all in mild range). There was no change in cardiovascular status associated with enzyme replacement therapy. No significant safety concerns related to enzyme replacement therapy were identified. Although some patients with late-onset Pompe disease had abnormalities on baseline electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, those classically seen in infantile Pompe disease, such as significant ventricular hypertrophy, were not noted. Cardiovascular parameters were not impacted by enzyme replacement therapy, and there were no cardiovascular safety concerns. The cardiovascular abnormalities identified may be related to Pompe disease or other comorbid conditions.	1
Targeting the Prion-like Aggregation of Mutant p53 to Combat Cancer. || Humans Hydrogen Bonding Molecular Dynamics Simulation Molecular Structure Mutation Neoplasms Protein Aggregates Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Prion-like behavior of several amyloidogenic proteins has been demonstrated in recent years. Despite having functional roles in some cases, irregular aggregation can have devastating consequences. The most commonly known amyloid diseases are Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs). The pathophysiology of prion-like diseases involves the structural transformation of wild-type (wt) proteins to transmissible forms that can convert healthy proteins, generating aggregates. The mutant form of tumor suppressor protein, p53, has recently been shown to exhibit prion-like properties. Within the context of p53 aggregation and the search for ways to avert it, this review emphasizes discoveries, approaches, and research from our laboratory and others. Although its standard functions are strongly connected to tumor suppression, p53 mutants and aggregates are involved in cancer progression. p53 aggregates are heterogeneous assemblies composed of amorphous aggregates, oligomers, and amyloid-like fibrils. Evidence of these structures in tumor tissues, the in vitro capability for p53 mutants to coaggregate with wt protein, and the detection of cell-to-cell transmission indicate that cancer has the basic characteristics of prion and prion-like diseases. Various approaches aim to restore p53 functions in cancer. Methods include the use of small-molecule and peptide stabilizers of mutant p53, zinc administration, gene therapy, alkylating and DNA intercalators, and blockage of p53-MDM2 interaction. A primary challenge in developing small-molecule inhibitors of p53 aggregation is the large number of p53 mutations. Another issue is the inability to recover p53 function by dissociating mature fibrils. Consequently, efforts have emerged to target the intermediate species of the aggregation reaction. Φ-value analysis has been used to characterize the kinetics of the early phases of p53 aggregation. Our experiments using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and chemical denaturants have helped to clarify excited conformers of p53 that are prone to aggregation. Molecular dynamics (MD) and phasor analysis of single Trp fluorescence signals point toward the presence of preamyloidogenic conformations of p53, which are not observed for p63 or p73. Exploring the features of competent preamyloidogenic states of wt and different p53 mutants may provide a framework for designing personalized drugs for the restoration of p53 function. Protection of backbone hydrogen bonds (BHBs) has been shown to be an important factor for the stability of amyloidogenic proteins and was employed to identify and stabilize the structural defect resulting from the p53 Y220C mutation. Using MD simulations, we compared BHB protection factors between p53 family members to determine the donor-acceptor pairs in p53 that exhibit lower protection. The identification of structurally vulnerable sites in p53 should provide new insights into rational designs that can rapidly be screened using our experimental methodology. Through continued and combined efforts, the outlook is positive for the development of strategies for regulating p53 amyloid transformation.	0
p53 dominant-negative mutant R273H promotes invasion and migration of human endometrial cancer HHUA cells. || Base Sequence Cell Line, Tumor DNA Primers Endometrial Neoplasms Female Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Polymerase Chain Reaction Transcription, Genetic Transfection || Dominant negative (DN) mutations of tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) are clinically associated with cancer progression and metastasis of endometrial malignancy. To investigate the DN effect on tumor migration and invasion, we generated cells that stably co-expressed wild-type (wt) and R273H DN mutant TP53 (273H cells), and wt and R213Q recessive mutant TP53 (213Q cells), by transfection in endometrial cancer cells HHUA that expressed wt p53. R273H, but not R213Q, repressed wt p53-stimulated transcription of p21, Bax, and MDM2. 273H cells also showed markedly increased in vitro invasion and migration potentials, and displayed reduced Maspin, PAI-1, and KAI1 mRNA expressions as compared with 213Q and wt cells. The induction of wt p53 function by use of Adriamycin resulted in the inhibition of the invasion/migration capacity in association with the up-regulation of p53 target genes to a far greater degree in 213Q and wt cells than in 273H cells. R273H expression in p53-null cancer cell SK-OV-3 and Saos-2 did not significantly affect cell invasion and migration activities. Taken together, these results suggest that transdominance of R273H mutant over wt p53 rather than a gain-of-function promotes tumor metastasis by increasing invasion and migration in HHUA cells.	0
Identification of the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3 as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Azepines Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Colorectal Neoplasms DEAD-box RNA Helicases Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells HT29 Cells Humans Imidazoles Immunoblotting Immunohistochemistry Male Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation RNA Interference Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Transcription Factor 4 Transcription Factors Wnt Signaling Pathway beta Catenin || Identifying druggable targets in the Wnt-signaling pathway can optimize colorectal cancer treatment. Recent studies have identified a member of the RNA helicase family DDX3 (DDX3X) as a multilevel activator of Wnt signaling in cells without activating mutations in the Wnt-signaling pathway. In this study, we evaluated whether DDX3 plays a role in the constitutively active Wnt pathway that drives colorectal cancer. We determined DDX3 expression levels in 303 colorectal cancers by immunohistochemistry. 39% of tumors overexpressed DDX3. High cytoplasmic DDX3 expression correlated with nuclear β-catenin expression, a marker of activated Wnt signaling. Functionally, we validated this finding in vitro and found that inhibition of DDX3 with siRNA resulted in reduced TCF4-reporter activity and lowered the mRNA expression levels of downstream TCF4-regulated genes. In addition, DDX3 knockdown in colorectal cancer cell lines reduced proliferation and caused a G1 arrest, supporting a potential oncogenic role of DDX3 in colorectal cancer. RK-33 is a small molecule inhibitor designed to bind to the ATP-binding site of DDX3. Treatment of colorectal cancer cell lines and patient-derived 3D cultures with RK-33 inhibited growth and promoted cell death with IC50 values ranging from 2.5 to 8 μM. The highest RK-33 sensitivity was observed in tumors with wild-type APC-status and a mutation in CTNNB1. Based on these results, we conclude that DDX3 has an oncogenic role in colorectal cancer. Inhibition of DDX3 with the small molecule inhibitor RK-33 causes inhibition of Wnt signaling and may therefore be a promising future treatment strategy for a subset of colorectal cancers.	0
Prevalence of deleterious mutations among patients with breast cancer referred for multigene panel testing in a Romanian population. ||  || Multigene panel testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) using next generation sequencing is becoming more common in medical care.We report our experience regarding deleterious mutations of high and moderate-risk breast cancer genes (BRCA1/2, TP53, STK11, CDH1, PTEN, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM), as well as more recently identified cancer genes, many of which have increased risk but less well-defined penetrance. Genetic testing was performed in 130 consecutive cases with breast cancer referred to our clinic for surgical evaluation and who met the 2016 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for genetic testing. 82 patients had pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations and VUS mutations, and 48 were negative; 36 of the pathogenic mutations were in the high-risk genes and 16 were in the moderate risk genes and only 5 cases in the intermediary risk group.From the VUS mutation group 21 cases were in the intermediary risk group, 9 cases were in the moderate risk group and only 7 cases in high risk group.The most frequent BRCA1 variant was c.3607C>T (7 cases) followed by c.5266dupC and c.4035delA (each in 4 cases). Regarding BRCA-2 mutations we identified c.9371A>T and c.8755-1G>A in 6 cases and we diagnosed VUS mutations in 3 cases. Our study identified 2 mutations in the BRCA1 gene that are less common in the Romanian population, c.3607C>T and c.4035delA. Both variants had particular molecular phenotypes, c.3607C>T variant respecting the triple negative pattern of BRCA1 breast cancer while c.4035delA were Luminal B HER positive.	4
Identification of ANKRD11 as a p53 coactivator. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor DNA Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Silencing Genes, p53 HeLa Cells Humans Models, Biological Mutation Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Structure, Tertiary Repressor Proteins Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The ability of p53 to act as a transcription factor is critical for its function as a tumor suppressor. Ankyrin repeat domain 11, ANKRD11 (also known as ANR11 or ANCO1), was found to be a novel p53-interacting protein that enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53. ANKRD11 expression was shown to be downregulated in breast cancer cell lines. Restoration of ANKRD11 expression in MCF-7 (wild-type p53) and MDA-MB-468 (p53(R273H) mutant) cells suppressed their proliferative and clonogenic properties through enhancement of CDKN1A (p21(waf1)/CIP1) expression. ShRNA-mediated silencing of ANKRD11 expression reduced the ability of p53 to activate CDKN1A expression. ANKRD11 was shown to associate with the p53 acetyltransferases and cofactors, P/CAF and hADA3. Exogenous ANKRD11 expression enhanced the levels of acetylated p53 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. ANKRD11 enhanced the DNA-binding properties of mutant p53(R273H) to the CDKN1A promoter, suggesting that ANKRD11 can mediate the restoration of normal p53 function in some cancer-related p53 mutations. In addition, ANKRD11 itself was found to be a novel p53 target gene. These findings demonstrate a role for ANKRD11 as a p53 coactivator and suggest the involvement of ANKRD11 in a regulatory feedback loop with p53.	0
A comprehensive focus on global spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in breast cancer. || BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Female Founder Effect Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genetics, Population Humans Mutagenesis, Insertional Mutant Proteins Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Sequence Deletion || Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer of women all over the world. BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations comprise the most important genetic susceptibility of BC. Except for few common mutations, the spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is heterogeneous in diverse populations. 185AGdel and 5382insC are the most important BRCA1 and BRCA2 alterations which have been encountered in most of the populations. After those Ashkenazi founder mutations, 300T>G also demonstrated sparse frequency in African American and European populations. This review affords quick access to the most frequent alterations among various populations which could be helpful in BRCA screening programs.	4
Chaperones in autophagy. || Animals Autophagy Cytosol Endosomes Humans Lysosomes Molecular Chaperones Muscular Diseases Neurodegenerative Diseases Protein Folding Protein Transport Protein Unfolding || Cells continuously turn over proteins through cycles of synthesis and degradation in order to maintain a functional proteome and to exert a tight control in the levels of regulatory proteins. Selective degradation of proteins was initially thought to be an exclusive function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, however, over the years, the contribution of lysosomes to this selective degradation, through the process of autophagy, has become consolidated. In this context, molecular chaperones, classically associated with protein folding, unfolding and assembling have been revealed as important modulators of selectivity during the autophagic process. Here, we review this relatively new role of chaperones in mediating selective autophagy and comment on how alterations of this function can lead to human pathologies associated to proteotoxicity.	0
BAG3 mutation in a patient with atypical phenotypes of myofibrillar myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Adolescent Adult Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Child Child, Preschool Creatine Kinase Female Humans Infant Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Myopathies, Structural, Congenital Republic of Korea Whole Exome Sequencing Young Adult || Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) mutations have been reported to cause the myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) which shows progressive limb muscle weakness, respiratory failure, and cardiomyopathy. Myopathy patients with BAG3 mutation are very rare. We described a patient showing atypical phenotypes. We aimed to find the genetic cause of Korean patients with sensory motor polyneuropathy, myopathy and rigid spine. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) with 423 patients with sensory motor polyneuropathy. We found BAG3 mutation in one patient with neuropathy, myopathy and rigid spine syndrome, and performed electrophysiological study, whole body MRI and muscle biopsy on the patient. A de novo heterozygous p.Pro209Leu (c.626C>T) mutation in BAG3 was identified in a female myopathy. She first noticed a gait disturbance and spinal rigidity at the age of 11, and serum creatine kinase levels were elevated ninefolds than normal. She showed an axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), myopathy, rigid spine and respiratory dysfunction; however, she did not show any cardiomyopathy, which is a common symptom in BAG3 mutation. Lower limb MRI and whole spine MRI showed bilateral symmetric fatty atrophy of muscles at the lower limb and paraspinal muscles. When we track traceable MRI 1 year later, the muscle damage progressed slowly. As far as our knowledge, this is the first Korean patient with BAG3 mutation. We described a BAG3 mutation patient with atypical phenotype of CMT and myopathy, and those are expected to broaden the clinical spectrum of the disease and help to diagnose it.	4

Cardinal features include postnatally reduced growth, distinctive facial dysmorphism, congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, variable cognitive deficit and skeletal, ectodermal and hematologic anomalies. Noonan syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, and is genetically heterogeneous. So far, heterozygous mutations in nine genes (PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, NRAS, RAF1, BRAF, SHOC2, MEK1 and CBL) have been documented to underlie this disorder or clinically related phenotypes. Based on these recent discoveries, the diagnosis can now be confirmed molecularly in approximately 75% of affected individuals. Affected genes encode for proteins participating in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, which is implicated in several developmental processes controlling morphology determination, organogenesis, synaptic plasticity and growth. Here, we provide an overview of clinical aspects of this disorder and closely related conditions, the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, and major genotype-phenotype correlations.	4
Acute respiratory failure as presentation of late-onset Pompe disease complicating the diagnostic process as a labyrinth: a case report. ||  || Acute respiratory failure can be triggered by several causes, either of pulmonary or extra-pulmonary origin. Pompe disease, or type II glycogen storage disease, is a serious and often fatal disorder, due to a pathological accumulation of glycogen caused by a defective activiy of acid α-glucosidase (acid maltase), a lysosomal enzyme involved in glycogen degradation. The prevalence of the disease is estimated between 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 300,000 subjects. This case report describes a difficult diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in a 52 year old Caucasian woman with acute respiratory failure requiring orotracheal intubation and subsequent tracheostomy for long-term mechanical ventilation 24 h/day. Despite a complex diagnostic process including several blood tests, bronchoscopy with BAL, chest CT, brain NMR, electromyographies, only a muscle biopsy allowed to reach the correct diagnosis. The most frequent presentation of myopathies, including LOPD, is proximal limb muscle weakness. Respiratory related symptoms (dyspnea on effort, reduced physical capacity, recurrent infections, etc.) and respiratory failure are often evident in the later stages of the diseases, but they have been rarely described as the onset symptoms in LOPD. In our case, a third stage LOPD, the cooperation between pulmonologists and neurologists was crucial in reaching a correct diagnosis despite a very complex clinical scenario due to different confounding co-morbidities as potential causes of respiratory failure and an atypical presentation. In this patient, enzyme replacement therapy with infusion of alglucosidase alfa was associated with progressive reduction of ventilatory support to night hours, and recovery of autonomous walking.	1
Development and clinical application of an integrative genomic approach to personalized cancer therapy. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child DNA Copy Number Variations Exome Female Genetic Variation Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Precision Medicine Prognosis Young Adult || Personalized therapy provides the best outcome of cancer care and its implementation in the clinic has been greatly facilitated by recent convergence of enormous progress in basic cancer research, rapid advancement of new tumor profiling technologies, and an expanding compendium of targeted cancer therapeutics. We developed a personalized cancer therapy (PCT) program in a clinical setting, using an integrative genomics approach to fully characterize the complexity of each tumor. We carried out whole exome sequencing (WES) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray genotyping on DNA from tumor and patient-matched normal specimens, as well as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on available frozen specimens, to identify somatic (tumor-specific) mutations, copy number alterations (CNAs), gene expression changes, gene fusions, and also germline variants. To provide high sensitivity in known cancer mutation hotspots, Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (CHPv2) was also employed. We integrated the resulting data with cancer knowledge bases and developed a specific workflow for each cancer type to improve interpretation of genomic data. We returned genomics findings to 46 patients and their physicians describing somatic alterations and predicting drug response, toxicity, and prognosis. Mean 17.3 cancer-relevant somatic mutations per patient were identified, 13.3-fold, 6.9-fold, and 4.7-fold more than could have been detected using CHPv2, Oncomine Cancer Panel (OCP), and FoundationOne, respectively. Our approach delineated the underlying genetic drivers at the pathway level and provided meaningful predictions of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Actionable alterations were found in 91 % of patients (mean 4.9 per patient, including somatic mutations, copy number alterations, gene expression alterations, and germline variants), a 7.5-fold, 2.0-fold, and 1.9-fold increase over what could have been uncovered by CHPv2, OCP, and FoundationOne, respectively. The findings altered the course of treatment in four cases. These results show that a comprehensive, integrative genomic approach as outlined above significantly enhanced genomics-based PCT strategies.	4
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in inactivating mutant BRAF by geldanamycin derivatives. || Acetylcysteine Antibiotics, Antineoplastic Benzoquinones Cell Line, Tumor Enzyme Activation HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins Humans Lactams, Macrocyclic Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Mutation Oxidative Stress Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf || The geldanamycin derivatives 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) are promising chemotherapeutic drugs that inhibit heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) function. Previous studies have shown that 17-AAG/DMAG treatment induces the degradation of mutant BRAF (V600E) and inhibits the activation of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2). We have found, however, that HSP90 inhibition alone is not sufficient for efficient BRAF(V600E) degradation in some cells. HSP90 inhibitors structurally unrelated to geldanamycin, radicicol and novobiocin, while inducing the degradation of the HSP90 client protein RAF-1 fail to induce BRAF(V600E) degradation or inhibit MEK1/2 activation in HT29 human colon cancer cells. Moreover, after treatment with 17-DMAG, the kinase activity of residual, undegraded BRAF(V600E) was also lost. Incubation of cells with a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, partially restored kinase activity and also partially prevented BRAF(V600E) degradation due to 17-DMAG treatment. Conversely, treatment with the ROS producing drug menadione clearly inhibited MEK1/2 and reduced BRAF(V600E). These results suggest that in addition to direct inhibition of HSP90, the antitumor effect of geldanamycin and its derivatives is also mediated though the production of ROS, which may directly inactivate tumorigenic mutant BRAF(V600E).	0
Mito-nuclear co-evolution: the positive and negative sides of functional ancient mutations. ||  || Most cell functions are carried out by interacting factors, thus underlying the functional importance of genetic interactions between genes, termed epistasis. Epistasis could be under strong selective pressures especially in conditions where the mutation rate of one of the interacting partners notably differs from the other. Accordingly, the order of magnitude higher mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation rate as compared to the nuclear DNA (nDNA) of all tested animals, should influence systems involving mitochondrial-nuclear (mito-nuclear) interactions. Such is the case of the energy producing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial translational machineries which are comprised of factors encoded by both the mtDNA and the nDNA. Additionally, the mitochondrial RNA transcription and mtDNA replication systems are operated by nDNA-encoded proteins that bind mtDNA regulatory elements. As these systems are central to cell life there is strong selection toward mito-nuclear co-evolution to maintain their function. However, it is unclear whether (A) mito-nuclear co-evolution befalls only to retain mitochondrial functions during evolution or, also, (B) serves as an adaptive tool to adjust for the evolving energetic demands as species' complexity increases. As the first step to answer these questions we discuss evidence of both negative and adaptive (positive) selection acting on the mtDNA and nDNA-encoded genes and the effect of both types of selection on mito-nuclear interacting factors. Emphasis is given to the crucial role of recurrent ancient (nodal) mutations in such selective events. We apply this point-of-view to the three available types of mito-nuclear co-evolution: protein-protein (within the OXPHOS system), protein-RNA (mainly within the mitochondrial ribosome), and protein-DNA (at the mitochondrial replication and transcription machineries).	0
Transcriptome profiling identifies HMGA2 as a biomarker of melanoma progression and prognosis. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Line, Tumor Disease Progression Female HMGA2 Protein Humans Male Melanoma Middle Aged Prognosis Proportional Hazards Models Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Transcriptome Young Adult || The genetic alterations contributing to melanoma pathogenesis are incompletely defined, and few independent prognostic features have been identified beyond the clinicopathological characteristics of the primary tumor. We used transcriptome profiling of 46 primary melanomas, 12 melanoma metastases, and 16 normal skin (N) samples to find genes associated with melanoma development and progression. Results were confirmed using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR and replicated in an independent set of 330 melanomas using AQUA analysis of tissue microarray (TMA). Transcriptome profiling revealed that transcription factor HMGA2, previously unrecognized in melanoma pathogenesis, is significantly upregulated in primary melanoma and metastases (P-values=1.2 × 10(-7) and 9 × 10(-5)) compared with N. HMGA2 overexpression is associated with BRAF/NRAS mutations (P=0.0002). Cox proportional hazard regression model and log-rank test showed that HMGA2 is independently associated with disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR)=6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.8-22.3, P=0.004), overall survival (OS) (stratified log-rank P=0.008), and distant metastases-free survival (HR=6.4, 95% CI=1.4-29.7, P=0.018) after adjusting for American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and age at diagnosis. Survival analysis in an independent replication TMA of 330 melanomas confirmed the association of HMGA2 expression with OS (P=0.0211). Our study implicates HMGA2 in melanoma progression and demonstrates that HMGA2 overexpression can serve as an independent predictor of survival in melanoma.	4
Molecular alterations in partially-encapsulated or well-circumscribed follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. || Adult Aged Amino Acid Substitution Boston Carcinoma, Papillary, Follicular Cohort Studies Female Follow-Up Studies GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Association Studies Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Retrospective Studies Thyroid Gland Thyroid Neoplasms Tumor Burden Young Adult ras Proteins || Studies have described an encapsulated and an infiltrative form of the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC). Encapsulated FVPTCs have been reported to have virtually no recurrence risk or metastatic potential and to harbor RAS mutations but not BRAF mutations. In contrast, infiltrative tumors have significant metastatic potential, a risk of recurrence, and a BRAF mutation frequency of approximately 25%. In our experience, a substantial number of FVPTCs are neither fully encapsulated nor infiltrative, but instead are partially encapsulated (PE) or well circumscribed (WC). We have previously reported that PE/WC FVPTCs behave in an indolent fashion similar to encapsulated tumors. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the molecular alterations in PE/WC FVPTC. We identified 28 PE/WC FVPTCs resected consecutively at our institution. Targeted mutation analysis of 41 genes including members of the RAS and RAF families was performed on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks using single-base extension chemistry and mass spectrometry. Lymph node metastases were absent in all cases with sampled lymph nodes, and no patients developed tumor recurrences (median follow-up time, 72.8 months). Overall, 13 cases (46%) harbored RAS mutations, including seven (25%) with NRAS mutations (p.Gln61Arg) and six (21%) with HRAS mutations (five had p.Gln61Arg and one had a p.Gln61Lys substitution). No PE/WC FVPTCs had BRAF mutations. The results of this study confirm our previous finding that PE/WC FVPTCs pursue an indolent clinical course. Additionally, we found that PE/WC tumors have a similar molecular profile to that of encapsulated FVPTCs with frequent RAS mutations (46%) and no BRAF mutations. These molecular results provide further evidence that PE/WC and encapsulated FVPTCs are biologically similar and should be distinguished from more aggressive infiltrative FVPTCs.	4
Regulation of proliferation and cell cycle by protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma. ||  || Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1), a microtubule-associated protein, has emerged as a critical regulator of proliferation and apoptosis, acting predominantly in numerous tumors. However, its function in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is still unknown. To establish the roles of PRC1 in OSCC, 95 oral clinical samples (54 OSCC, 24 oral leukoplakia [OLK], and 17 normal oral mucosa) and seven oral cell lines (6 OSCC and 1 normal oral cell lines) were analyzed using a series of molecular and genomic assays both in vivo and in vitro were conducted in this study. Herein, we provide evidence demonstrating that expression of PRC1 closely correlates with the degree of epithelial dysplasia in OLK (n = 24) (p < 0.001), and the poor differentiation, large tumor volume, lymph node metastasis, and high-clinical stage in OSCC (n = 54) (p < 0.05), illustrating that PRC1 has a promotive influence on tumor progression in OSCC. Simultaneously, we observed that PRC1 knockdown in OSCC cell lines caused G2/M phase arrest (p < 0.05), inhibited cell proliferation in vitro (p < 0.05) and tumor growth in vivo (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the effects of PRC1 on the regulation of proliferation and cell cycle transition in OSCC samples were mediated by p53. The p53/PRC1/EGFR signaling pathway was found to be implicated in the tumor progression of OSCC. Based on our data, we demonstrate that PRC1 is a key factor in regulating proliferation and the cell cycle, pointing to the potential benefits of PRC1-targeted therapies for OSCC.	0
Diagnostic RAS mutation analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ||  || RAS mutation analysis is an important companion diagnostic test. Treatment of colorectal cancer with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) therapy requires demonstration of RAS mutation status (both KRAS and NRAS), and it is good practice to include BRAF. In Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma, assessment of RAS mutation status can be helpful in triaging patient samples for more extensive testing. This mini-review will discuss the role of PCR methods in providing rapid diagnostic information for cancer patients.	4
Structures of p53 cancer mutants and mechanism of rescue by second-site suppressor mutations. || Arginine Crystallography, X-Ray DNA Humans Mutation Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We have solved the crystal structures of three oncogenic mutants of the core domain of the human tumor suppressor p53. The mutations were introduced into a stabilized variant. The cancer hot spot mutation R273H simply removes an arginine involved in DNA binding without causing structural distortions in neighboring residues. In contrast, the "structural" oncogenic mutations H168R and R249S induce substantial structural perturbation around the mutation site in the L2 and L3 loops, respectively. H168R is a specific intragenic suppressor mutation for R249S. When both cancer mutations are combined in the same molecule, Arg(168) mimics the role of Arg(249) in wild type, and the wild type conformation is largely restored in both loops. Our structural and biophysical data provide compelling evidence for the mechanism of rescue of mutant p53 by intragenic suppressor mutations and reveal features by which proteins can adapt to deleterious mutations.	0
A rapid method for simultaneous screening of multi-gene mutations associated with hearing loss in the Korean population. || Adult Case-Control Studies Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness Female Genetic Testing Genotype Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Male Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Mutation RNA, Ribosomal Republic of Korea Sequence Analysis, DNA Sulfate Transporters || Hearing loss (HL) is a congenital disease with a high prevalence, and patients with hearing loss need early diagnosis for treatment and prevention. The GJB2, MT-RNR1, and SLC26A4 genes have been reported as common causative genes of hearing loss in the Korean population and some mutations of these genes are the most common mutations associated with hearing loss. Accordingly, we developed a method for the simultaneous detection of seven mutations (c.235delC of GJB2, c.439A>G, c.919-2A>G, c.1149+3A>G, c.1229C>T, c.2168A>G of SLC26A4, and m.1555A>G of the MT-RNR1 gene) using multiplex SNaPshot minisequencing to enable rapid diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss. This method was confirmed in patients with hearing loss and used for genetic diagnosis of controls with normal hearing and neonates. We found that 4.06% of individuals with normal hearing and 4.32% of neonates were heterozygous carriers. In addition, we detected that an individual is heterozygous for two different mutations of GJB2 and SLC26A4 gene, respectively and one normal hearing showing the heteroplasmy of m.1555A>G. These genotypes corresponded to those determined by direct sequencing. Overall, we successfully developed a robust and cost-effective diagnosis method that detects common causative mutations of hearing loss in the Korean population. This method will be possible to detect up to 40% causative mutations associated with prelingual HL in the Korean population and serve as a useful genetic technique for diagnosis of hearing loss for patients, carriers, neonates, and fetuses.	4
Targeted molecular profiling reveals genetic heterogeneity of poromas and porocarcinomas. || Aged Aged, 80 and over DNA Mutational Analysis Eccrine Porocarcinoma Female Gene Expression Profiling Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Male Middle Aged Poroma Sweat Gland Neoplasms Transcriptome Young Adult || The genetic landscape of rare benign tumours and their malignant counterparts is still largely unexplored. While recent work showed that mutant HRAS is present in subsets of poromas and porocarcinomas, a more comprehensive genetic view on these rare adnexal neoplasms is lacking. Using high-coverage next generation sequencing, we investigated the mutational profile of 50 cancer-related genes in 12 cases (six poromas and six porocarcinomas). Non-synonymous mutations were found in two-thirds of both poromas and porocarcinomas. Hotspot HRAS mutations were identified in two poromas (p.G13R and p.Q61R) and one porocarcinoma (p.G13C). While in poromas only few cases showed single mutated genes, porocarcinomas showed greater genetic heterogeneity with up to six mutated genes per case. Recurrent TP53 mutations were found in all porocarcinomas that harboured mutated genes. Non-recurrent mutations in porocarcinomas were found in several additional tumour suppressors (RB1, APC, CDKN2A, and PTEN), and genes implicated in PI3K-AKT and MAPK signalling pathways (ABL1, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, HRAS, and RET). UV-associated mutations were found in TP53, APC, CDKN2A, PTEN, and RET. In conclusion, our study confirms and extends the spectrum of genetic lesions in poromas and porocarcinomas. While poromas exhibited only few mutations, which did not involve TP53, the majority of porocarcinomas harboured UV-mediated mutations in TP53 with some of these cases showing considerable genetic heterogeneity that may be clinically exploitable.	4
Aberrant Cx26 hemichannels and keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome: insights into syndromic hearing loss. ||  || Mutation of the GJB2 gene, which encodes the connexin 26 (Cx26) gap junction (GJ) protein, is the most common cause of hereditary, sensorineural hearing loss. Cx26 is not expressed in hair cells, but is widely expressed throughout the non-sensory epithelial cells of the cochlea. Most GJB2 mutations produce non-syndromic deafness, but a subset produces syndromic deafness in which profound hearing loss is accompanied by a diverse array of infectious and neoplastic cutaneous disorders that can be fatal. Although GJ channels, which are assembled by the docking of two, so-called hemichannels (HCs), have been the main focus of deafness-associated disease models, it is now evident that the HCs themselves can function in the absence of docking and contribute to signaling across the cell membrane as a novel class of ion channel. A notable feature of syndromic deafness mutants is that the HCs exhibit aberrant behaviors providing a plausible basis for disease that is associated with excessive or altered contributions of Cx26 HCs that, in turn, lead to compromised cell integrity. Here we discuss some of the aberrant Cx26 HC properties that have been described for mutants associated with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, a particularly severe Cx26-associated syndrome, which shed light on genotype-phenotype relationships and causes underlying cochlear dysfunction.	0
Gain-of-Function (GOF) Mutant p53 as Actionable Therapeutic Target. ||  || p53 missense mutant alleles are present in nearly 40% of all human tumors. Such mutated alleles generate aberrant proteins that not only lose their tumor-suppressive functions but also frequently act as driver oncogenes, which promote malignant progression, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance, leading to reduced survival in patients and mice. Notably, these oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) missense mutant p53 proteins (mutp53) are constitutively and tumor-specific stabilised. This stabilisation is one key pre-requisite for their GOF and is largely due to mutp53 protection from the E3 ubiquitin ligases Mdm2 and CHIP by the HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery. Recent mouse models provide convincing evidence that tumors with highly stabilized GOF mutp53 proteins depend on them for growth, maintenance, and metastasis, thus creating exploitable tumor-specific vulnerabilities that markedly increase lifespan if intercepted.

This review discusses direct mutp53 protein-targeting drug strategies that are currently being developed at various preclinical levels.	0
Reactivating mutant p53 using small molecules as zinc metallochaperones: awakening a sleeping giant in cancer. || Animals Antineoplastic Agents Drug Design Humans Metallochaperones Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Protein Folding Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Zinc || Tumor protein p53 (TP53) is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. The majority of mutations are missense, and generate a defective protein that is druggable. Yet, for decades, the small-molecule restoration of wild-type (WT) p53 function in mutant p53 tumors (so-called p53 mutant 'reactivation') has been elusive to researchers. The p53 protein requires the binding of a single zinc ion for proper folding, and impairing zinc binding is a major mechanism for loss of function in missense mutant p53. Here, we describe recent work defining a new class of drugs termed zinc metallochaperones that restore WT p53 structure and function by restoring Zn(2+) to Zn(2+)-deficient mutant p53.	0
Cadherins and mechanotransduction by hair cells. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Animals Biological Evolution Cadherins Deafness Hair Cells, Auditory Humans Mechanotransduction, Cellular Molecular Motor Proteins Mutation Myosins Protein Structure, Tertiary Usher Syndromes || Mechanotransduction, the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal is crucial for our ability to hear and to maintain balance. Recent findings indicate that two members of the cadherin superfamily are components of the mechanotransduction machinery in sensory hair cells of the vertebrate inner ear. These studies show that cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) form several of the extracellular filaments that connect the stereocilia and kinocilium of a hair cell into a bundle. One of these filaments is the tip link that has been proposed to gate the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells. The extracellular domains of CDH23 and PCDH15 differ in their structure from classical cadherins and their cytoplasmic domains bind to distinct effectors, suggesting that evolutionary pressures have shaped the two cadherins for their function in mechanotransduction.	0
Novel and recurrent mutations of the LDL receptor gene in Korean patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. || Adolescent Adult Aged Animals CHO Cells Child Cricetinae DNA Mutational Analysis Female Fibroblasts Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Korea Male Middle Aged Mutation Receptors, LDL || We have identified 16 different mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene in 25 unrelated Korean patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), including five novel mutations, C83Y, 661del17, 1705insCTAG, C675X, and 941-1G>A. The 1705insCTAG mutation in which the four 3 cent -terminal nucleotides of exon 11 are duplicated was found to prevent splicing of exon 11 and would therefore generate a truncated polypeptide. The in-frame 36-bp deletion (1591del36) in exon 11, which had been reported only in one Korean FH patient, was also found. We showed that this change affects transport of the LDL receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. In addition, we found 8 mutations (-136C>T, E119K, E207K, E207X, F382L, R574Q, 1846-1G>A, and P664L) that had been described in other ethnic groups but not in Koreans, and 2 mutations (R94H and D200N) that had been described in Koreans as well as other ethnic groups. 5 mutations (1591del36, E119K, E207X, E207K, and P664L) were found more than once in the Korean FH samples. Identification of the novel and recurring LDLR mutations in Korean FH patients should facilitate prenatal and early diagnosis in families at high risk of FH.	4
p53 Deletion or Hotspot Mutations Enhance mTORC1 Activity by Altering Lysosomal Dynamics of TSC2 and Rheb. || Gene Deletion Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells Humans Lysosomes Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins Multiprotein Complexes Mutation Neuropeptides Nuclear Proteins Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain Protein TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || The activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is frequently enhanced in carcinomas, an effect thought to contribute to the malignant phenotype. Here, it is demonstrated that either deletion or mutation of TP53 in colon or lung carcinoma cells substantially enhances mTORC1 kinase activity by an effect downstream of and independent of AMPK. Mechanistically, it was determined that loss or mutation of p53 decreased expression of TSC2 and Sestrin2 (SESN2). Complementation of p53 null cells with TSC2 or Sestrin2 reduced mTORC1 activity to levels found in p53 wild-type (wt) cells, whereas their genetic depletion enhanced mTORC1 activity in p53 wt cells. However, the primary causal event in enhanced mTORC1 activity upon loss of p53 appeared to be a diminished distribution of TSC2 to lysosomal membranes containing mTOR. Subsequently, there was increased Rheb in the lysosomal compartment, and a higher mTOR association with Raptor. Transfection of TSC2 into p53 null cells replaced TSC2 and diminished Rheb at the lysosome, recapitulating cells with wt p53. In contrast, transfection of Sestrin2 decreased mTOR in lysosomes, but the lower levels of Sestrin2 in p53 null cells did not change lysosomal mTOR. In summary, loss of the transcriptional activity of p53, either by deletion or by key mutations in the DNA-binding domain, diminishes expression of TSC2 and Sestrin2, thus, shifting membrane-bound TSC2 out of lysosomal membranes, increasing lysosomal Rheb and increasing the kinase activity of mTORC1. This study establishes that loss of p53 function decreases lysosomal TSC2 and increases lysosomal Rheb resulting in hyperactive mTORC1, findings that are consistent with a more malignant phenotype.	0
Prevalence of DFNB1 mutations in Slovak patients with non-syndromic hearing loss. || Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Prevalence Slovakia || Non-syndromic hearing loss is one of the most common genetically determined diseases in human. The incidence is approximately 1:700 and most of the cases are caused by mutations in specific locus - DFNB1, which contains two genes -GJB2 and GJB6. For the GJB2 gene following mutations are most prevalent in specific populations - 35delG, 235delC, W24X and 167delT for Caucasians, Asians, Indians and Ashkenazi Jews, respectively. Large deletions are common in GJB6 gene. Many other mutations and polymorphisms were found in DFNB1 focused non-syndromic hearing loss studies thus the establishment of optimal screening protocol should be based on population specific mutation screening studies and is an objective in our study. In our study samples from 273 non-syndromic hearing loss patients were screened for mutations in coding and non-coding part of GJB2 gene and large deletion in GJB6 gene - del(GJB6-D13S1830). Causal mutation on both chromosomes was detected in 24.57% of patients, another 9.9% carried causal mutation on one chromosome. Totally 7 polymorphisms: V27I, M34T, F83L, 354 C→T, R127H, V153I, 684 C→A and 11 causal mutations: IVS1+1 G→A, 35delG, W24X, V37I, E47X, 167delT, V84M, L90P, 310del14, 333-334delAA, R184Q were detected. No patient carried the GJB6 deletion mutation (del(GJB6-D13S1830)). According to our results sequencing of GJB2 coding regions and IVS1+1G→A specific detection should explain approximately 25% of sporadic NSHL cases and these two tests are relevant for use as routine screening protocol for NSHL in Slovakia. The GJB6 del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutation was not detected in any of NSHL samples therefore it is not necessary to implement it in our routine screening protocol.	4
MYO7A and USH2A gene sequence variants in Italian patients with Usher syndrome. || Adolescent Adult Aged Amino Acid Substitution Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female Genetic Variation Humans Italy Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Myosins Pedigree Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Analysis, DNA Sequence Deletion Usher Syndromes Young Adult || To analyze the spectrum of sequence variants in the MYO7A and USH2A genes in a group of Italian patients affected by Usher syndrome (USH). Thirty-six Italian patients with a diagnosis of USH were recruited. They received a standard ophthalmologic examination, visual field testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan, and electrophysiological tests. Fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence imaging were performed in selected cases. All the patients underwent an audiologic examination for the 0.25-8,000 Hz frequencies. Vestibular function was evaluated with specific tests. DNA samples were analyzed for sequence variants of the MYO7A gene (for USH1) and the USH2A gene (for USH2) with direct sequencing techniques. A few patients were analyzed for both genes. In the MYO7A gene, ten missense variants were found; three patients were compound heterozygous, and two were homozygous. Thirty-four USH2A gene variants were detected, including eight missense variants, nine nonsense variants, six splicing variants, and 11 duplications/deletions; 19 patients were compound heterozygous, and three were homozygous. Four MYO7A and 17 USH2A variants have already been described in the literature. Among the novel mutations there are four USH2A large deletions, detected with multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. Two potentially pathogenic variants were found in 27 patients (75%). Affected patients showed variable clinical pictures without a clear genotype-phenotype correlation. Ten variants in the MYO7A gene and 34 variants in the USH2A gene were detected in Italian patients with USH at a high detection rate. A selective analysis of these genes may be valuable for molecular analysis, combining diagnostic efficiency with little time wastage and less resource consumption.	4
Low Energy Conformations for S100 Binding Peptide from the Negative Regulatory Domain of p53. || Humans Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular Peptides Protein Domains Protein Structure, Secondary S100 Proteins Software Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || We have computed the low energy conformations of the negative regulatory domain of p53, residues 374-388 using Empirical Conformational Energies of Peptides Program including solvation and computed the statistical weights of distinct conformational states. We find that there are two high probability conformations, one an α-helix from Lys 374-Lys 381, followed by another helical structure involving Lys 382-Glu 388 (statistical weight of 0.48) and an all-α-helix for the entire sequence (statistical weight of 0.23). Both structure are superimposable on the NMR structure of this sequence bound to the S100 protein. The global minimum structure (statistical weight of 0.014) is a beta structure from Gly 374-Arg 379 followed by an α-helix from His 380-Glu 388. Based on these results, we propose a possible strategy for enhancement of p53 anti-tumor activity in cancer cells. Since the structure of this sequence bound to the sirtuin protein, Sir2, is a β-sheet, we further propose that the global minimum may be an intermediate on the α-β structure transition.	0
Whole-exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in peritoneal metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma: A preliminary study. || Adenocarcinoma DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Peritoneal Neoplasms Stomach Neoplasms Whole Exome Sequencing || Peritoneal metastasis occurs in more than half of patients with unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer and is associated with the worst prognosis. The associated genomic events and pathogenesis remain ambiguous. The aim of the present study was to characterize the mutation spectrum of gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis and provide a basis for the identification of new biomarkers and treatment targets. Matched pairs of normal gastric mucosa and peritoneal tissue and matched pairs of primary tumor and peritoneal metastasis were collected from one patient for whole-exome sequencing (WES); Sanger sequencing was employed to confirm the somatic mutations. G>A and C>T mutations were the two most frequent transversions among the somatic mutations. We confirmed 48somatic mutations in the primary site and 49 in the peritoneal site. Additionally, 25 non-synonymous somatic variations (single-nucleotide variants, SNVs) and 2 somatic insertions/deletions (INDELs) were confirmed in the primary tumor, and 30 SNVs and 5 INDELs were verified in the peritoneal metastasis. Approximately 59% of the somatic mutations were shared between the primary and metastatic site. Five genes (TP53, BAI1, THSD1, ARID2, and KIAA2022) verified in our study were also mutated at a frequency greater than 5%in the COSMIC database. We also identified 9genes (ERBB4, ZNF721, NT5E, PDE10A, CA1, NUMB, NBN, ZFYVE16, and NCAM1) that were only mutated in metastasis and are expected to become treatment targets. In conclusion, we observed that the majority of the somatic mutations in the primary site persisted in metastasis, whereas several single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurred de novo at the second site.	4
High expression of the p53 isoform γ is associated with reduced progression-free survival in uterine serous carcinoma. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous Female Humans Middle Aged Mutation Progression-Free Survival Protein Isoforms RNA, Messenger Retrospective Studies Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Uterine Neoplasms || Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is a rare but aggressive subtype of endometrial carcinoma. Large-scale comprehensive efforts have resulted in an improved molecular understanding of its pathogenesis, and the p53 pathway has been proposed as a key player and is potentially targetable. Here we attempt to further portray the p53 pathway in USC by assessing p53 isoform expression. We applied quantitative Real-Time PCRs (RT-qPCR) for expression analyses of total p53 mRNA as well as quantitative distinction of p53β, p53γ, and the total mRNA of amino-terminal truncated Δ40p53 and Δ133p53 in a retrospective cohort of 37 patients with USC. TP53 mutation status was assessed by targeted massive parallel sequencing. Findings were correlated with clinical data. The p53 isoform expression landscape in USCs was heterogeneous and dominated by total Δ133p53, while the distinct p53β and p53γ variants were found at much lower levels. The isoform expression profiles varied between samples, while their expression was independent of TP53 mutation status. We found high relative p53γ expression to be associated with reduced progression-free survival (PFS). This is the first indication that elevated p53γ expression is associated with reduced PFS in USC. This single-center study may offer some insight in the landscape of p53 isoform expression in USC, but further validation studies are crucial to understand the context-dependent and tissue-specific role of the p53 isoform network in gynecological cancer.	4
The tetrahydrobiopterin loading test in 36 patients with hyperphenylalaninaemia: evaluation of response and subsequent treatment. ||  || The response to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, EC 1.14.16.1) deficiency (OMIM 261600) has been widely reported. Here we report results of the BH4 loading test (20 mg/kg per day) in a group of 36 patients with PAH deficiency and phenotype of mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA), mild phenylketonuria (PKU) or classic PKU. The patients ranged from neonates aged 7-15 days, detected in the Newborn Screening Programme for PKU in the population of Galicia (NW Spain), to adults aged up to 32 years who had been receiving a low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet for a period of years. Ten of the 36 patients showed a reduction of more than 30% in plasma Phe levels within 24 h of BH4 loading (ranging from 33.7% to 90.2%, mean 59.2%, SD 19.8%). All the patients with mild HPA (100%) showed a positive response; 57% of patients with mild PKU (4 of 7) showed a positive response. Of particular interest were positive responses in two patients with classic PKU, and in one patient with mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene that have not to date been reported to be BH4-responsive (p.S303A and p.G46S). BH4 treatment (5-8 mg/kg per day) was commenced in 9 of the 10 BH4-responsive patients. The observed responses to treatment argue for application of the BH4 loading test in all patients with HPA or PKU, independently of genotype, phenotype or age.	1 3
A simplified method for detection of the mutations predominantly causing cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria in Polish families. ||  || Genomic DNA was isolated from dried blood specimens and subsequently used as a template in simplified PCR-based detection assays of delta F508 mutation of CFTR gene and of R408W mutation of PAH gene in families with cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria, respectively. Products of amplification of CFTR gene were analyzed in NuSieve agarose gel. The amplification-created restriction site with TaqI digestion was used for detection of the PAH gene mutation.	3
Suppression of inhibitor of differentiation 2, a target of mutant p53, is required for gain-of-function mutations. || Adenocarcinoma Blotting, Northern Cell Proliferation Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Colonic Neoplasms Colony-Forming Units Assay Fluorescent Antibody Technique Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2 Luciferases Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA, Messenger RNA, Small Interfering Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Overexpression of mutant p53 is a common theme in human tumors, suggesting a tumor-promoting gain-of-function for mutant p53. To elucidate whether and how mutant p53 acquires its gain-of-function, mutant p53 is inducibly knocked down in the SW480 colon cancer cell line, which contains mutant p53(R273H/P309S), and the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line, which contains mutant p53(R248W). We found that knockdown of mutant p53 markedly inhibits cell proliferation. In addition, knockdown of mutant p53 sensitizes tumor cells to growth suppression by various chemotherapeutic drugs. To determine whether a gene involved in cell growth and survival is regulated by mutant p53, gene expression profiling analysis was performed and showed that the expression level of Id2, a member of the inhibitor of differentiation (Id) family, was markedly increased upon knockdown of mutant p53. To confirm this, Northern blot analysis was performed and showed that the expression level of Id2 was regulated by various mutant p53s in multiple cell lines. In addition, we found that the Id2 promoter is responsive to mutant but not wild-type p53, and mutant p53 binds to the Id2 promoter. Consistent with these observations, expression of endogenous Id2 was found to be inhibited by exogenous mutant p53 in p53-null HCT116 cells. Finally, we showed that knockdown of Id2 can restore the proliferative potential of tumor cells inhibited by withdrawal of mutant p53. Together, these findings suggest that one mechanism by which mutant p53 acquires its gain-of-function is through the inhibition of Id2 expression.	0
Muscle dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: what is needed to move to translation? || Animals Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Humans Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular Myocardium || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in sarcomere genes. As such, HCM provides remarkable opportunities to study how changes to the heart's molecular motor apparatus may influence cardiac structure and function. Although the genetic basis of HCM is well-described, there is much more limited understanding of the precise consequences of sarcomere mutations--how they remodel the heart, and how these changes lead to the dramatic clinical consequences associated with HCM. More precise characterization of the mechanisms leading from sarcomere mutation to altered cardiac muscle function is critical to gain insight into fundamental disease biology and phenotypic evolution. Such knowledge will help foster development of novel treatment strategies aimed at correcting and preventing disease development in HCM.	4
The rebel angel: mutant p53 as the driving oncogene in breast cancer. || Breast Neoplasms Female Genes, p53 Humans Mutation Oncogenes || Breast cancer is the most frequent invasive tumor diagnosed in women, causing over 400 000 deaths yearly worldwide. Like other tumors, it is a disease with a complex, heterogeneous genetic and biochemical background. No single genomic or metabolic condition can be regarded as decisive for its formation and progression. However, a few key players can be pointed out and among them is the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, commonly mutated in breast cancer. In particular, TP53 mutations are exceptionally frequent and apparently among the key driving factors in triple negative breast cancer -the most aggressive breast cancer subgroup-whose management still represents a clinical challenge. The majority of TP53 mutations result in the substitution of single aminoacids in the central region of the p53 protein, generating a spectrum of variants ('mutant p53s', for short). These mutants lose the normal p53 oncosuppressive functions to various extents but can also acquire oncogenic properties by gain-of-function mechanisms. This review discusses the molecular processes translating gene mutations to the pathologic consequences of mutant p53 tumorigenic activity, reconciling cell and animal models with clinical outcomes in breast cancer. Existing and speculative therapeutic methods targeting mutant p53 are also discussed, taking into account the overlap of mutant and wild-type p53 regulatory mechanisms and the crosstalk between mutant p53 and other oncogenic pathways in breast cancer. The studies described here concern breast cancer models and patients-unless it is indicated otherwise and justified by the importance of data obtained in other models.	0
Effect of mutations in the PCSK9 gene on the cell surface LDL receptors. || Amino Acid Substitution Catalysis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Membrane Humans Hypercholesterolemia Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Receptors, LDL Serine Endopeptidases Transfection || The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (LDLR). Mutations in the PCSK9 gene have been associated with both hypocholesterolemia and hypercholesterolemia through 'loss-of-function' and 'gain-of-function' mechanisms, respectively. We have studied the effect of the four loss-of-function mutations R46L, G106R, N157K and R237W and the two gain-of-function mutations S127R and D374Y on the autocatalytic activity of PCSK9, as well as on the amount of the cell surface LDLR and internalization of LDL in transiently transfected HepG2 cells. The two groups of mutations did not differ with respect to autocatalytic activity of PCSK9, but they did differ with respect to the amount of cell surface LDLR and internalization of LDL. The four loss-of-function mutations had a 16% increased level of cell surface LDLR and a 35% increased level of internalization of LDL as compared with WT-PCSK9. The two gain-of-function mutations had a 23% decreased level of cell surface LDLR and a 38% decreased level of internalization of LDL as compared with WT-PCSK9. Our studies have also shown that transfer of media from transiently transfected HepG2 cells to untransfected HepG2 cells, reduces the amount of cell surface LDLR and internalization of LDL in the untransfected cells within 20 min of media transfer. Thus, PCSK9 or a factor acted upon by PCSK9, is secreted from the transfected cells and degrades LDLR both in transfected and untransfected cells.	0
MotorPlex provides accurate variant detection across large muscle genes both in single myopathic patients and in pools of DNA samples. || Computer Simulation Female Genetic Variation Humans Male Muscle, Skeletal Muscular Diseases Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA || Mutations in ~100 genes cause muscle diseases with complex and often unexplained genotype/phenotype correlations. Next-generation sequencing studies identify a greater-than-expected number of genetic variations in the human genome. This suggests that existing clinical monogenic testing systematically miss very relevant information.We have created a core panel of genes that cause all known forms of nonsyndromic muscle disorders (MotorPlex). It comprises 93 loci, among which are the largest and most complex human genes, such as TTN, RYR1, NEB and DMD. MotorPlex captures at least 99.2% of 2,544 exons with a very accurate and uniform coverage. This quality is highlighted by the discovery of 20-30% more variations in comparison with whole exome sequencing. The coverage homogeneity has also made feasible to apply a cost-effective pooled sequencing strategy while maintaining optimal sensitivity and specificity.We studied 177 unresolved cases of myopathies for which the best candidate genes were previously excluded. We have identified known pathogenic variants in 52 patients and potential causative ones in further 56 patients. We have also discovered 23 patients showing multiple true disease-associated variants suggesting complex inheritance. Moreover, we frequently detected other nonsynonymous variants of unknown significance in the largest muscle genes. Cost-effective combinatorial pools of DNA samples were similarly accurate (97-99%). MotorPlex is a very robust platform that overcomes for power, costs, speed, sensitivity and specificity the gene-by-gene strategy. The applicability of pooling makes this tool affordable for the screening of genetic variability of muscle genes also in a larger population. We consider that our strategy can have much broader applications.	4
Identification and genotype/phenotype correlation of mutations in a large German cohort with hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genotype Germany Hearing Loss Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Prevalence Young Adult || The prevalence of hearing impairment is estimated as approximately 1 on 1,000 newborn children. To assess a higher mutation detection rate in individuals with hearing loss a three-step mutation screening program consisting of GJB2 in first line, then GJB1, GJB3 and GJB6 (second step) and if tested negative or heterozygote, testing of GJA1, GJB4, SLC26A4 and PJVK (third) was performed. Audiograms were derived from all patients to characterize audiological features of GJB2 mutations especially. In 59 patients (31.3%) of the 188 probands, the hearing impairment was due to GJB2 mutations, 45 (23.9%) of these being homozygous for 35delG mutation and 14 (7.4%) compound heterozygous for GJB2 mutations in the coding region of exon 2 whereas no significant sequence variation was found in exon 1. In 22 (11.7%) additional patients a single recessive mutation in GJB2, GJB3, GJB6 and SLC26A4 without a second mutation on the other allele was identified, making genetic counseling difficult. Our study showed significant difference in hearing loss degree in the patients with GJB2-mutations. Forty-five (45.5%) GJB2-cases were identified in 99 individuals diagnosed with severe to profound hearing loss, 14 (17.7%) GJB2-cases were identified in 79 individuals with moderate deafness whereas no clear GJB2 mutation was found in 10 patients with mild hearing loss (p < 0.001). Revealing a high variability of hearing levels in identical genotypes (even intrafamilial), a significant genotype-phenotype correlation could not be established. Based on the identified mutations spectrum and frequencies, speaking mostly of GJB2, a step by step screening for mutations can be devised and in addition may lead to a better stratification of patients for specific therapeutical approaches.	4
Improving the management of Inherited Retinal Dystrophies by targeted sequencing of a population-specific gene panel. || Alleles Computer Simulation DNA Copy Number Variations DNA Mutational Analysis Eye Proteins Gene Library Genetic Association Studies Genetic Heterogeneity Genetic Therapy High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Phenotype Retinal Dystrophies || Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has overcome important limitations to the molecular diagnosis of Inherited Retinal Dystrophies (IRD) such as the high clinical and genetic heterogeneity and the overlapping phenotypes. The purpose of this study was the identification of the genetic defect in 32 Spanish families with different forms of IRD. With that aim, we implemented a custom NGS panel comprising 64 IRD-associated genes in our population, and three disease-associated intronic regions. A total of 37 pathogenic mutations (14 novels) were found in 73% of IRD patients ranging from 50% for autosomal dominant cases, 75% for syndromic cases, 83% for autosomal recessive cases, and 100% for X-linked cases. Additionally, unexpected phenotype-genotype correlations were found in 6 probands, which led to the refinement of their clinical diagnoses. Furthermore, intra- and interfamilial phenotypic variability was observed in two cases. Moreover, two cases unsuccessfully analysed by exome sequencing were resolved by applying this panel. Our results demonstrate that this hypothesis-free approach based on frequently mutated, population-specific loci is highly cost-efficient for the routine diagnosis of this heterogeneous condition and allows the unbiased analysis of a miscellaneous cohort. The molecular information found here has aid clinical diagnosis and has improved genetic counselling and patient management.	4
INDELseek: detection of complex insertions and deletions from next-generation sequencing data. || Algorithms Computational Biology Genomics Germ-Line Mutation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans INDEL Mutation Neoplasms Reproducibility of Results Sequence Analysis, DNA Software || Complex insertions and deletions (indels) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data were prone to escape detection by currently available variant callers as shown by large-scale human genomics studies. Somatic and germline complex indels in key disease driver genes could be missed in NGS-based genomics studies. INDELseek is an open-source complex indel caller designed for NGS data of random fragments and PCR amplicons. The key differentiating factor of INDELseek is that each NGS read alignment was examined as a whole instead of "pileup" of each reference position across multiple alignments. In benchmarking against the reference material NA12878 genome (n = 160 derived from high-confidence variant calls), GATK, SAMtools and INDELseek showed complex indel detection sensitivities of 0%, 0% and 100%, respectively. INDELseek also detected all known germline (BRCA1 and BRCA2) and somatic (CALR and JAK2) complex indels in human clinical samples (n = 8). Further experiments validated all 10 detected KIT complex indels in a discovery cohort of clinical samples. In silico semi-simulation showed sensitivities of 93.7-96.2% based on 8671 unique complex indels in >5000 genes from dbSNP and COSMIC. We also demonstrated the importance of complex indel detection in accurately annotating BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 mutations with gained or rescued protein-truncating effects. INDELseek is an accurate and versatile tool for complex indel detection in NGS data. It complements other variant callers in NGS-based genomics studies targeting a wide spectrum of genetic variations.	4
Prevalence and Phenotypic Expression of Mutations in the MYH7, MYBPC3 and TNNT2 Genes in Families with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in the South of Brazil: A Cross-Sectional Study. || Adult Brazil Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Carrier Proteins Cross-Sectional Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Death, Sudden, Cardiac Female Genetic Association Studies Humans Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Phenotype Sarcomeres Severity of Illness Index Statistics, Nonparametric Troponin T Young Adult || Mutations in sarcomeric genes are found in 60-70% of individuals with familial forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, this estimate refers to northern hemisphere populations. The molecular-genetic profile of HCM has been subject of few investigations in Brazil, particularly in the south of the country. To investigate mutations in the sarcomeric genes MYH7, MYBPC3 and TNNT2 in a cohort of HCM patients living in the extreme south of Brazil, and to evaluate genotype-phenotype associations. Direct DNA sequencing of all encoding regions of three sarcomeric genes was conducted in 43 consecutive individuals of ten unrelated families. Mutations for CMH have been found in 25 (58%) patients of seven (70%) of the ten study families. Fourteen (56%) individuals were phenotype-positive. All mutations were missense, four (66%) in MYH7 and two (33%) in MYBPC3. We have not found mutations in the TNNT2 gene. Mutations in MYH7 were identified in 20 (47%) patients of six (60%) families. Two of them had not been previously described. Mutations in MYBPC3 were found in seven (16%) members of two (20%) families. Two (5%) patients showed double heterozygosis for both genes. The mutations affected different domains of encoded proteins and led to variable phenotypic expression. A family history of HCM was identified in all genotype-positive individuals. In this first genetic-molecular analysis carried out in the south of Brazil, we found mutations in the sarcomeric genes MYH7 and MYBPC3 in 58% of individuals. MYH7-related disease was identified in the majority of cases with mutation.

Sequenciamento direto do DNA de todas as regiões codificantes dos três genes sarcoméricos foi realizada em 43 indivíduos consecutivos de dez famílias não-relacionadas. Mutações para CMH foram encontradas em 25 (58%) indivíduos de sete (70%) das dez famílias estudadas, sendo 14 (56%) deles fenótipo-positivos. Todas as mutações eram missense, quatro (66%) no gene MYH7 e duas (33%) no gene MYBPC3. Não foram encontradas mutações no gene TNNT2. Mutações em MYH7 foram identificadas em 20 (47%) indivíduos de seis (60%) famílias. Duas delas não haviam sido previamente relatadas. Mutações de MYBPC3 foram detectadas em sete (16%) membros de duas (20%) famílias. Dois (5%) indivíduos apresentaram dupla heterozigose com mutações em ambos os genes. As mutações acometeram distintos domínios das proteínas codificadas e produziram expressão fenotípica variável. História familiar de CMH foi identificada em todos os indivíduos genótipo-positivos. Nessa primeira análise genético-molecular da CMH realizada no sul do Brasil, foram encontradas mutações nos genes sarcoméricos MYH7 e MYBPC3 em 58% dos indivíduos. Doença relacionada ao gene MYH7 foi identificada na maioria dos casos com mutação.	4
NAT10 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and enhances mutant p53 activity. || Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Liver Neoplasms Middle Aged Mutation N-Terminal Acetyltransferase E Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) is a histone acetyltransferase which is involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Recent evidences indicate that NAT10 is involved in the development of human cancers. Previous study showed that NAT10 acetylates the tumor suppressor p53 and regulates p53 activation. As Tp53 gene is frequently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associates with the occurrence and development of HCC, the relationship between NAT10 and HCC was investigated in this study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis were performed to evaluate the NAT10 expression in HCC. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to verify the interaction of NAT10 with mutant p53 and Mdm2. RNA interference and Western blot were applied to determine the effect of NAT10 on mutant p53. Cell growth curve was used to examine the effect of NAT10 on HCC cell proliferation. NAT10 was upregulated in HCC and increased NAT10 expression was correlated with poor overall survival of the patients. NAT10 protein levels were significantly correlated with p53 levels in human HCC tissues. Furthermore, NAT10 increased mutant p53 levels by counteracting Mdm2 action in HCC cells and promoted proliferation in cells carrying p53 mutation. Increased NAT10 expression levels are associated with shortened patient survival and correlated with mutant p53 levels. NAT10 upregulates mutant p53 level and might enhance its tumorigenic activity. Hence, we propose that NAT10 is a potential prognostic and therapeutic candidate for p53-mutated HCC.	0
Epigenetic and genetic features of 24 colon cancer cell lines. ||  || Cell lines are invaluable biomedical research tools, and recent literature has emphasized the importance of genotype authentication and characterization. In the present study, 24 out of 27 cell line identities were confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling. The molecular phenotypes of the 24 colon cancer cell lines were examined, and microsatellite instability (MSI) and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) were determined, using the Bethesda panel mononucleotide repeat loci and two epimarker panels, respectively. Furthermore, the BRAF, KRAS and PIK3CA oncogenes were analyzed for mutations in known hotspots, while the entire coding sequences of the PTEN and TP53 tumor suppressors were investigated. Nine cell lines showed MSI. Thirteen and nine cell lines were found to be CIMP positive, using the Issa panel and the Weisenberger et al. panel, respectively. The latter was found to be superior for CIMP classification of colon cancer cell lines. Seventeen cell lines harbored disrupting TP53 mutations. Altogether, 20/24 cell lines had the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activating mutually exclusive KRAS or BRAF mutations. PIK3CA and PTEN mutations leading to hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway were observed in 13/24 cell lines. Interestingly, in four cell lines there were no mutations in neither BRAF, KRAS, PIK3CA nor in PTEN. In conclusion, this study presents molecular features of a large number of colon cancer cell lines to aid the selection of suitable in vitro models for descriptive and functional research.	0
Fibrillar aggregates of the tumor suppressor p53 core domain. || Animals Cell Line Hot Temperature Humans Macrophages Mice Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Electron Oxidation-Reduction Pressure Protein Denaturation Protein Folding Protein Structure, Secondary Protein Structure, Tertiary Tetrazolium Salts Thiazoles Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cystic fibrosis, prion diseases, and many types of cancer are considered to be protein conformation diseases. Most of them are also known as amyloidogenic diseases due to the occurrence of pathological accumulation of insoluble aggregates with fibrillar conformation. Some neuroblastomas, carcinomas, and myelomas show an abnormal accumulation of the wild-type tumor suppressor protein p53 either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of the cell. Here we show that the wild-type p53 core domain (p53C) can form fibrillar aggregates after mild perturbation. Gentle denaturation of p53C by pressure induces fibrillar aggregates, as shown by electron and atomic force microscopies, by binding of thioflavin T, and by circular dichroism. On the other hand, heat denaturation produced granular-shaped aggregates. Annular aggregates similar to those found in the early aggregation stages of alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta were also observed by atomic force microscopy immediately after pressure treatment. Annular and fibrillar aggregates of p53C were toxic to cells, as shown by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] reduction assay. Interestingly, the hot-spot mutant R248Q underwent similar aggregation behavior when perturbed by pressure or high temperature. Fibrillar aggregates of p53C contribute to the loss of function of p53 and seed the accumulation of conformationally altered protein in some cancerous cells.	0
Mendelian diseases among Roman Jews: implications for the origins of disease alleles. || Alleles Connexin 26 Connexins Cystic Fibrosis Gaucher Disease Gene Frequency Genetic Diseases, Inborn Humans Jews Mutation Rome || The Roman Jewish community has been historically continuous in Rome since pre-Christian times and may have been progenitor to the Ashkenazi Jewish community. Despite a history of endogamy over the past 2000 yr, the historical record suggests that there was admixture with Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews during the Middle Ages. To determine whether Roman and Ashkenazi Jews shared common signature mutations, we tested a group of 107 Roman Jews, representing 176 haploid sets of chromosomes. No mutations were found for Bloom syndrome, BRCA1, BRCA2, Canavan disease, Fanconi anemia complementation group C, or Tay-Sachs disease. Two unrelated individuals were positive for the 3849 + 10C->T cystic fibrosis mutation; one carried the N370S Gaucher disease mutation, and one carried the connexin 26 167delT mutation. Each of these was shown to be associated with the same haplotype of tightly linked microsatellite markers as that found among Ashkenazi Jews. In addition, 14 individuals had mutations in the familial Mediterranean fever gene and three unrelated individuals carried the factor XI type III mutation previously observed exclusively among Ashkenazi Jews. These findings suggest that the Gaucher, connexin 26, and familial Mediterranean fever mutations are over 2000 yr old, that the cystic fibrosis 3849 + 10kb C->T and factor XI type III mutations had a common origin in Ashkenazi and Roman Jews, and that other mutations prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews are of more recent origin.	4
A low renal threshold for glucose in diabetic patients with a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene. ||  || One form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, Type 3 (MODY3), results from mutations in the gene coding for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), a transcription factor first described in the liver. MODY3 is characterized by a defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Earlier observations of glycosuria with normal blood glucose levels in some MODY families suggest an additional renal manifestation of the respective genetic defect. We measured the renal threshold for glucose in five diabetic carriers of a missense mutation (Arg 272 His) in HNF-1alpha and, for comparison, in eight Type 1 diabetic patients, applying a non-invasive protocol of frequent parallel blood and urine sampling during a slow shift in blood glucose levels. We found that the mean renal threshold for glucose was lowered in the HNF-1alpha diabetic patients compared to those with Type 1 diabetes (6.5 +/- 0.9 mmol l(-1) vs 10.7 +/- 0.5 mmol l(-1); p < 0.01). This lowered glucose threshold might be an indication of an extra-pancreatic effect of HNF-1alpha gene mutations in humans. Defects in HNF-1alpha may lead to an altered tubular glucose reabsorption, possibly due to decreased expression of the renal glucose transporter proteins involved in reabsorption of glucose from the urine.	4
Genomic characterization of patient-derived xenograft models established from fine needle aspirate biopsies of a primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and from patient-matched metastatic sites. || Animals Biopsy, Fine-Needle Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal Humans Male Mice Mice, Inbred NOD Neoplasm Metastasis Pancreatic Neoplasms Precision Medicine Proof of Concept Study Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || N-of-1 trials target actionable mutations, yet such approaches do not test genomically-informed therapies in patient tumor models prior to patient treatment. To address this, we developed patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies (FNA-PDX) obtained from primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at the time of diagnosis. Here, we characterize PDX models established from one primary and two metastatic sites of one patient. We identified an activating KRAS G12R mutation among other mutations in these models. In explant cells derived from these PDX tumor models with a KRAS G12R mutation, treatment with inhibitors of CDKs (including CDK9) reduced phosphorylation of a marker of CDK9 activity (phospho-RNAPII CTD Ser2/5) and reduced viability/growth of explant cells derived from PDAC PDX models. Similarly, a CDK inhibitor reduced phospho-RNAPII CTD Ser2/5, increased apoptosis, and inhibited tumor growth in FNA-PDX and patient-matched metastatic-PDX models. In summary, PDX models can be constructed from FNA biopsies of PDAC which in turn can enable genomic characterization and identification of potential therapies.	0
PIK3CA mutations in advanced cancers: characteristics and outcomes. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival Exons Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Logistic Models Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Molecular Targeted Therapy Multivariate Analysis Mutation Neoplasms Odds Ratio Phenotype Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Polymerase Chain Reaction Precision Medicine Proportional Hazards Models Protein Kinase Inhibitors Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Retrospective Studies Risk Factors TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases Time Factors Treatment Outcome Young Adult ras Proteins || PIK3CA mutations are frequently diagnosed in diverse cancers and may predict response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors. It remains unclear whether they are associated with other characteristics. We analyzed characteristics and outcome of 90 consecutive patients with diverse advanced tumors and PIK3CA mutations and 180 wild-type PIK3CA controls matched by tumor type, gender, and age referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy. PIK3CA and MAPK mutations (KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing. The most frequent PIK3CA mutations were E545K (31/90, 34%), E542K (16/90, 18%) in exon 9, and H1047R (20/90, 22%) in exon 20. PIK3CA mutations compared to wild-type PIK3CA were associated with simultaneous KRAS (p=0.047) and MAPK mutations (p=0.03), but only MAPK mutations were confirmed as having an independent association in multivariate analysis. Rates of lung, bone, liver and brain metastases were similar in PIK3CA-mutant and wild-type patients. Patients with PIK3CA mutations treated on trials with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors had a higher partial/complete response (PR/CR) rate than wild-type PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy (10/56, 18% vs. 12/152, 8%; p=0.045), but not a prolonged progression-free survival. Patients with H1047R PIK3CA mutations had higher PR/CR rate with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors compared to wild-type PIK3CA patients treated with their best phase I therapy (6/16, 38% vs. 12/152, 8%; p=0.003). In conclusion, PIK3CA mutations in diverse cancers were not associated with clinical characteristics, but were correlated with MAPK mutations. PIK3CA mutations, especially, H1047R, were associated with attaining a PR/CR to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitors.	4
Cowden Syndrome with a Novel Germline PTEN Mutation and an Unusual Clinical Course. ||  || Here, we report a case of Cowden syndrome with an unusual clinical course of late-onset oral papillomatosis and a novel germline PTEN mutation. Cowden syndrome is the most common phosphatase and tensin homolog hamartomatous tumor syndrome. It is characterized by multiple hamartomas in the gastrointestinal tract and mucocutaneous lesions such as trichilemmomas, oral papillomatosis, facial papules, and acral keratoses. Patients with Cowden syndrome have a higher risk of malignancies, especially breast, colon, and thyroid cancers. A 53-year-old female presented with cobblestone-like papillomatous papules on the lower gums that developed 1 year earlier. She had no other mucocutaneous lesions besides oral papillomatosis. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed multiple hamartomas in the stomach and colon. The patient had a history of breast cancer and multinodular goiter diagnosed 4 and 5 years ago, respectively. She was diagnosed with Cowden syndrome and a novel PTEN mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing.	3
BAG2 promotes tumorigenesis through enhancing mutant p53 protein levels and function. || Animals Carcinogenesis Cell Line, Tumor Humans Mice, Nude Molecular Chaperones Mutant Proteins Protein Processing, Post-Translational Proteolysis Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitination || Tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in tumors. Many mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins promote tumorigenesis through the gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism. Mutp53 proteins often accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF. Its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we found that BAG2, a protein of Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family, promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors. Mechanistically, BAG2 binds to mutp53 and translocates to the nucleus to inhibit the MDM2-mutp53 interaction, and MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53. Thus, BAG2 promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in tumors. BAG2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients and mutp53 accumulation in tumors. These findings revealed a novel and important mechanism for mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors, and also uncovered an important role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis through promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOF.	0
Metabolic rewiring in melanoma. || Antineoplastic Agents Epigenesis, Genetic GTP Phosphohydrolases Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glutamine Glycolysis Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Skin Neoplasms Tumor Microenvironment || Oncogene-driven metabolic rewiring is an adaptation to low nutrient and oxygen conditions in the tumor microenvironment that enables cancer cells of diverse origin to hyperproliferate. Aerobic glycolysis and enhanced reliance on glutamine utilization are prime examples of such rewiring. However, tissue of origin as well as specific genetic and epigenetic changes determines gene expression profiles underlying these metabolic alterations in specific cancers. In melanoma, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway driven by mutant BRAF or NRAS is a primary cause of malignant transformation. Activity of the MAPK pathway, as well as other factors, such as HIF1α, Myc and MITF, are among those that control the balance between non-oxidative and oxidative branches of central carbon metabolism. Here, we discuss the nature of metabolic alterations that underlie melanoma development and affect its response to therapy.	0
Prospective study of a molecular selection profile for RAS wild type colorectal cancer patients receiving irinotecan-cetuximab. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols Biomarkers, Tumor Camptothecin Cetuximab Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Disease-Free Survival ErbB Receptors Exons Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Irinotecan Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Prospective Studies Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Receptor, ErbB-3 Treatment Outcome || The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a panel of biomarkers, prospectively analysed might be able to predict patients' clinical outcome more accurately than RAS status alone. K-RAS (exons 2, 3, 4) wild type colorectal cancer patients, candidates to second/third-line cetuximab with chemotherapy were prospectively allocated into 2 groups on the basis of their profile: favourable (BRAF and PIK3CA exon 20 wild type, EGFR GCN ≥ 2.6, HER-3 Rajkumar score ≤ 8, IGF-1 immunostaining < 2) or unfavourable (any of the previous markers altered or mutated). After the introduction of N-RAS status (exons 2, 3, 4) only RAS wild type patients were considered eligible. Primary aim was response rate (RR). To detect a difference in terms of RR among patients with an unfavourable profile (estimated around 25%) and patients with a favourable profile (estimated around 60%), with a probability alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.05, required sample size was 46 patients. Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Forty-six patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients (37%) were allocated to the favourable and 29 patients (63%) to the unfavourable profile. RR in the favourable and unfavourable group was 11/17 (65%) and 2/29 (7%) (p = 0.007) respectively. The favourable group also showed an improved PFS (8 months vs. 3 months, p < 0.0001) and OS (15 months vs. 6 months, p < 0.0001). Our results suggest that prospective selection of optimal candidates for cetuximab treatment is feasible and may be able to improve clinical outcome.	4
Distinct requirement for an intact dimer interface in wild-type, V600E and kinase-dead B-Raf signalling. || Benzenesulfonates Caco-2 Cells HCT116 Cells HT29 Cells Humans Indoles MAP Kinase Signaling System Niacinamide Phenylurea Compounds Protein Kinase Inhibitors Protein Multimerization Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Pyridines Sorafenib Sulfonamides || The dimerisation of Raf kinases involves a central cluster within the kinase domain, the dimer interface (DIF). Yet, the importance of the DIF for the signalling potential of wild-type B-Raf (B-Raf(wt)) and its oncogenic counterparts remains unknown. Here, we show that the DIF plays a pivotal role for the activity of B-Raf(wt) and several of its gain-of-function (g-o-f) mutants. In contrast, the B-Raf(V600E), B-Raf(insT) and B-Raf(G469A) oncoproteins are remarkably resistant to mutations in the DIF. However, compared with B-Raf(wt), B-Raf(V600E) displays extended protomer contacts, increased homodimerisation and incorporation into larger protein complexes. In contrast, B-Raf(wt) and Raf-1(wt) mediated signalling triggered by oncogenic Ras as well as the paradoxical activation of Raf-1 by kinase-inactivated B-Raf require an intact DIF. Surprisingly, the B-Raf DIF is not required for dimerisation between Raf-1 and B-Raf, which was inactivated by the D594A mutation, sorafenib or PLX4720. This suggests that paradoxical MEK/ERK activation represents a two-step mechanism consisting of dimerisation and DIF-dependent transactivation. Our data further implicate the Raf DIF as a potential target against Ras-driven Raf-mediated (paradoxical) ERK activation.	0

Here, we show that CPX inhibited tumor growth in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 xenografts. To unveil the underlying mechanism, we further studied the antitumor activity of CPX in cell culture. The results indicate that CPX inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30), breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells in a concentration-dependent manner. By cell cycle analysis, CPX induced accumulation of cells in G(1)/G(0) phase of the cell cycle. Concurrently, CPX downregulated cellular protein expression of cyclins (A, B1, D1 and E) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2 and CDK4) and upregulated expression of the CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1), leading to hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. CPX also downregulated protein expression of Bcl-xL and survivin and enhanced cleavages of Bcl-2. Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, partially prevented CPX-induced cell death, suggesting that CPX-induced apoptosis of cancer cells is mediated at least in part through caspase-dependent mechanism. The results indicate that CPX is a potential antitumor agent.	0
Sensitive methods for screening of the MEK1 gene mutations in patients with central nervous system metastases of non-small cell lung cancer. || Adenocarcinoma Biomarkers, Tumor Carcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Central Nervous System Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Early Detection of Cancer Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Lung Neoplasms Lymphatic Metastasis MAP Kinase Kinase 1 Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction || The mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1, MEK2) are fundamental partners in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway that is involved in regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Downregulation of the MEK cascades has been implicated in acquiring of the malignant phenotype in various cancers. Somatic mutations in MEK1 gene (substitutions K57N, Q56P, D67N) were described in <1 % of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and they were more commonly reported in adenocarcinoma patients with current or former smoking status. In the following study, we assessed the MEK1 gene mutations in 145 FFPE tissue samples from central nervous system (CNS) metastases of NSCLC using HRM-PCR and ASP-qPCR techniques. The studied group was heterogeneous in terms of histopathology and smoking status. The prevalence of the MEK1 gene mutation was correlated with the occurrence of mutations in KRAS, EGFR, DDR2, PIK3CA, NRAS, HER2, AKT1 and PTEN genes. Using HRM and ASP-qPCR methods we identified one (0.7 %; 1/145) MEK1 substitution (Q56P) in CNS metastases of NSCLC. The mutation was identified in a single, 50-year-old, current smoking men with adenocarcinoma (1.25 %; 1/80 of all adenocarcinomas). According to the current knowledge, the incidence of MEK1 gene mutation in CNS metastatic lesion of NSCLC is the first such report worldwide. The analysis of gene profile in cancer patients may extend the scope of molecularly targeted therapies used both in patients with primary and metastatic tumors of NSCLC.	4
Prepubertal Melanoma Arising within a Medium-Sized Congenital Melanocytic Nevus. || Child Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mutation Nevus, Pigmented Scalp Dermatoses Skin Neoplasms || We report the case of an 8-year-old child who developed a 9.4-mm-deep melanoma within a medium-sized congenital melanocytic nevus on the scalp. Genetic analysis revealed an activating NRAS Q61R mutation within the melanoma, which is more commonly associated with large or giant congenital melanocytic nevi. This case demonstrates that even a "low-risk" congenital melanocytic nevus at a "low-risk" age must be monitored regularly for the development of malignancy.	4
Heat-shock factor 1 both positively and negatively affects cellular clonogenic growth depending on p53 status. || Cell Line Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Clone Cells DNA-Binding Proteins Down-Regulation Female Heat Shock Transcription Factors Humans Mutant Proteins Mutation Transcription Factors Tumor Stem Cell Assay Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || HSF1 (heat-shock factor 1) is the master regulator of the heat-shock response; however, it is also activated by cancer-associated stresses and supports cellular transformation and cancer progression. We examined the role of HSF1 in relation to cancer cell clonogenicity, an important attribute of cancer cells. Ectopic expression or HSF1 knockdown demonstrated that HSF1 positively regulated cancer cell clonogenic growth. Furthermore, knockdown of mutant p53 indicated that HSF1 actions were mediated via a mutant p53-dependent mechanism. To examine this relationship more specifically, we ectopically co-expressed mutant p53(R273H) and HSF1 in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A. Surprisingly, within this cellular context, HSF1 inhibited clonogenicity. However, upon specific knockdown of endogenous wild-type p53, leaving mutant p53(R273H) expression intact, HSF1 was observed to greatly enhance clonogenic growth of the cells, indicating that HSF1 suppressed clonogenicity via wild-type p53. To confirm this we ectopically expressed HSF1 in non-transformed and H-Ras(V12)-transformed MCF10A cells. As expected, HSF1 significantly reduced clonogenicity, altering wild-type p53 target gene expression levels consistent with a role of HSF1 increasing wild-type p53 activity. In support of this finding, knockdown of wild-type p53 negated the inhibitory effects of HSF1 expression. We thus show that HSF1 can affect clonogenic growth in a p53 context-dependent manner, and can act via both mutant and wild-type p53 to bring about divergent effects upon clonogenicity. These findings have important implications for our understanding of HSF1's divergent roles in cancer cell growth and survival as well as its disparate effect on mutant and wild-type p53.	0
Detailed analysis of therapy-driven clonal evolution of TP53 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. || Adult Aged Antineoplastic Agents B-Lymphocytes Clonal Evolution Clone Cells Female Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell Male Middle Aged Mutation Recurrence Retrospective Studies Signal Transduction Survival Analysis Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the worst prognosis is associated with TP53 defects with the affected patients being potentially directed to alternative treatment. Therapy administration was shown to drive the selection of new TP53 mutations in CLL. Using ultra-deep next-generation sequencing (NGS), we performed a detailed analysis of TP53 mutations' clonal evolution. We retrospectively analyzed samples that were assessed as TP53-wild-type (wt) by FASAY from 20 patients with a new TP53 mutation detected in relapse and 40 patients remaining TP53-wt in relapse. Minor TP53-mutated subclones were disclosed in 18/20 patients experiencing later mutation selection, while only one minor-clone mutation was observed in those patients remaining TP53-wt (n=40). We documented that (i) minor TP53 mutations may be present before therapy and may occur in any relapse; (ii) the majority of TP53-mutated minor clones expand to dominant clone under the selective pressure of chemotherapy, while persistence of minor-clone mutations is rare; (iii) multiple minor-clone TP53 mutations are common and may simultaneously expand. In conclusion, patients with minor-clone TP53 mutations carry a high risk of mutation selection by therapy. Deep sequencing can shift TP53 mutation identification to a period before therapy administration, which might be of particular importance for clinical trials.	4
Rare copy number variations containing genes involved in RASopathies: deletion of SHOC2 and duplication of PTPN11. ||  || RASopathies are a group of disorders related to Noonan syndrome that with dysregulated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Noonan syndrome (NS, OMIM# 163950) is a both phenotypically and genotypically variable disorder. We and other researchers have demonstrated that copy number variations underlie a small percentage of patients with RASopathies. In a cohort of 12 clinically characterized patients with congenital heart defect (CHD) and features suggestive of Noonan syndrome or Noonan like syndrome without known causative gene mutation, we performed an Illumina SNP-array analysis to identify the pathogenic copy number variations (Human660W-Quad Chip, Beadstation Scanner and GenomeStudio V2011 software). We identifed two rare copy number variations harboring genes involved in RAS- MAPK signaling pathway of RASopathy. One is a 24 Mb duplication of 12q24.1-24.3 containing PTPN11 and the other is a 183 kb deletion of 10q25.2 including SHOC2. The SNP-array results were further validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). This is might be the first report suggesting that haploinsufficiency of SHOC2 can result in a RASopathy-like phenotype. Our findings provide additional support that copy number variations containing disease-causing genes of RAS/MAPK pathway play a minor role in RASopathies or related disorders. We recommend the use of microarrays in Noonan syndrome like patients without identified mutations in the causative genes.	4
[Mutations of GJB2 gene in infants with non-syndromic hearing impairment]. || Adult Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Bilateral Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Syndrome || To explore the relationship between GJB2 gene mutations and severe-to-profound bilateral non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI). Peripheral blood was collected from 20 infants with severe-to-profound bilateral NSHI confirmed by otoacoustic emissions (OAE), auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and clinical physical examination, 11 male and 9 female, aged 3 months to 3 years. PCR and sequencing technique were used to analyze the coding region of GJB2 gene. Fifty persons with normal hearing, 25 males and 25 female, aged 20 approximately 50, all without family history of hearing impairment, were used as controls. Three infants (15%) were identified as 235delC/235delC homozygotes; one infant was identified as 235delC/299-300delAT compound heterozygote; one was identified as 235delC heterozygote; and one as 235delC/605ins46 compound heterozygote with 605ins46 mutation, a novel mutation reported in Chinese for the first time. GJB2 gene mutations were found in 5 NSHI infants (25%). The allelic frequency of 235delC allele was 22.5% in the NSHI infants and 1% in the control group (P < 0.01). Besides, multiple polymorphisms such as V27I, V37I, E114G, T123N were found in both the patients and controls. GJB2 analysis is an important test for infants with severe-to-profound bilateral NSHI. 235delC is the main pathogenic mutation site in GJB2 gene.	4

By this means, a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 2 of the HRAS gene, designated c.34G > A (p.Gly12Ser), was detected, confirming the clinical diagnosis. Costello syndrome belongs to the group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous RASopathies with cutaneous symptoms. Collectively, the RASopathies are caused by mutations in different genes, which lead to dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway. This signaling route regulates the delicate balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, and plays an important role in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis. In the RASopathies with cutaneous symptoms, overlapping clinical findings may hamper making an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, a molecular genetic analysis may be useful, as in the patient described here.	4
[Screening for mutation variants in exons 5, 7, 12 of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene using denaturing gradient gel-electrophoresis]. || Base Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel Exons Genetic Testing Humans Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Ukraine || The assays for analysis of the most frequent mutations of PAH gene in Ukraine (R158Q, R408W, Y414C, P281L, R252W, R261Q) for RKU patients and healthy people using denaturing gradient gel-electrophoresis (DGGE) were developed. The study of spectrum of mutations in exons 5,7,12 PAH gene using DGGE technique and further sequencing of unidentified mutant variants was held.	1 3
Ubiquitin proteasome dysfunction in human hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. || Adenosine Triphosphatases Adolescent Adult Aged Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Female Humans Male Middle Aged Oxidative Stress Peptide Hydrolases Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Protein Processing, Post-Translational Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin Young Adult || The ubiquitin proteasome system maintains a dynamic equilibrium of proteins and prevents accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins, yet its role in human cardiac dysfunction is not well understood. The present study evaluated ubiquitin proteasome system function in human heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Proteasome function was studied in human nonfailing donor hearts, explanted failing hearts, and myectomy samples from patients with HCM. Proteasome proteolytic activities were markedly reduced in failing and HCM hearts compared with nonfailing hearts (P<0.01). This activity was partially restored after mechanical unloading in failing hearts (P<0.01) and was significantly lower in HCM hearts with pathogenic sarcomere mutations than in those lacking these mutations (P<0.05). There were no changes in the protein content of ubiquitin proteasome system subunits (ie, 11S, 20S, and 19S) or in active-site labeling of the 20S proteolytic subunit beta-5 among groups to explain decreased ubiquitin proteasome system activity in HCM and failing hearts. Examination of protein oxidation revealed that total protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxynonenylated proteins, and oxidative modification to 19S ATPase subunit Rpt 5 were increased in failing compared with nonfailing hearts. Proteasome activity in HCM and failing human hearts is impaired in the absence of changes in proteasome protein content or availability of proteolytic active sites. These data provide strong evidence that posttranslational modifications to the proteasome may account for defective protein degradation in human cardiomyopathies.	4
Extending the phenotypic spectrum of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome: report of a patient with GJB2 (G12R) Connexin 26 mutation and unusual clinical findings. || Antineoplastic Agents Connexin 26 Connexins Dapsone Deafness Dermatologic Agents Drug Therapy, Combination Female Humans Ichthyosis Keratitis Minocycline Mouth Mucosa Mutation Nevus Skin Diseases, Bacterial Skin Neoplasms Spironolactone Treatment Outcome Young Adult || Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare ectodermal dysplasia, characterized mainly by the presence of hyperkeratotic skin lesions, neurosensory hearing loss, and vascularizing keratitis. Most mutations that have been discovered as a cause of KID syndrome are autosomal dominant, found in exon 2 of the Connexin (Cx) 26 gene. A G12R (p.Gly12Arg) is a GJB2 mutation reported in only two patients with KID syndrome to date. This article describes a patient with the G12R mutation and KID syndrome with interesting additional features, which include a porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, follicular occlusion triad, and unusual persistent oral mucosal papules. We compare this patient's phenotype with the only two other patients described with the same (G12R) mutation. The phenotypic heterogeneity of KID syndrome, inexplicable according to our current understanding of these proteins, speaks to the complexity of the connexin system and its overlapping expression patterns in different tissues.	4
Novel compound heterozygous mutations in SLC26A4 gene in a Chinese family with enlarged vestibular aqueduct. ||  || In order to investigate the genetic causes of hearing loss in a Chinese proband with nonsyndromic hearing loss and enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), we conducted clinical and genetic evaluations in a deaf proband and her parents with normal hearing. 20 exons and flanking splice sites of the SLC26A4 gene were screened for pathogenic mutations by PCR amplification and bidirectional sequencing. As a control, a group of 400 healthy newborns from the same ethnic background were subjected to SLC26A4 gene screening using the same method. The proband harbored two mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in the form of compound heterozygosity. She was found to be heterozygous for a novel mutation c.574delC (p.Leu192Ter) in exon 5 and for the known mutation c.919-2A>G(c.IVS7-2A>G). Her mother was a heterozygous carrier of the c.919-2A>G mutation, and her father was a heterozygous carrier of the c.574delC and therefore co-segregated with the genetic disease. The c.574delC mutation was absent in 400 healthy newborns. The frameshift mutation causes the leucine (Leu) at amino acid position 192 to become a termination codon, leading to termination of protein sequence coding. This study demonstrates that the novel frameshift mutation c.574delC (p.Leu192Ter) in compound heterozygosity with c.919-2A>G in the SLC26A4 gene is the main cause of deafness in a family. Our study will expand the spectrum of known SLC26A4 mutations in the Chinese population, providing more information on genetic counseling, and diagnosis in hearing loss with EVA.	4
Dominant-negative mechanism of leukemogenic PAX5 fusions. || Cell Line Chromatin DNA, Circular Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching Gene Expression Genes, Dominant Genes, Reporter Humans Luciferases, Renilla Oncogene Proteins, Fusion PAX5 Transcription Factor Polydeoxyribonucleotides Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Protein Binding Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Multimerization Proteins || PAX5 encodes a master regulator of B-cell development. It fuses to other genes associated with acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL). These fusion products are potent dominant-negative (DN) inhibitors of wild-type PAX5, resulting in a blockade of B-cell differentiation. Here, we show that multimerization of PAX5 DNA-binding domain (DBD) is necessary and sufficient to cause extremely stable chromatin binding and DN activity. ALL-associated PAX5-C20S results from fusion of the N-terminal region of PAX5, including its paired DBD, to the C-terminus of C20orf112, a protein of unknown function. We report that PAX5-C20S is a tetramer, which interacts extraordinarily stably with chromatin as determined by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching in living cells. Tetramerization, stable chromatin binding and DN activity all require a putative five-turn amphipathic α-helix at the C-terminus of C20orf112, and does not require potential corepressor binding peptides elsewhere in the sequence. In vitro, the monomeric PAX5 DBD and PAX5-C20S binds a PAX5-binding site with equal affinity when it is at the center of an oligonucleotide too short to bind to more than one PAX5 DBD. But, PAX5-C20S binds the same sequence with 10-fold higher affinity than the monomeric PAX5 DBD when it is in a long DNA molecule. We suggest that the increased affinity results from interactions of one or more of the additional DBDs with neighboring non-specific sites in a long DNA molecule, and that this can account for the increased stability of PAX5-C20S chromatin binding compared with wild-type PAX5, resulting in DN activity by competition for binding to PAX5-target sites. Consistent with this model, the ALL-associated PAX5 fused to ETV6 or the multimerization domain of ETV6 SAM results in stable chromatin binding and DN activity. In addition, PAX5 DBD fused to artificial dimerization, trimerization and tetramerization domains results in parallel increases in the stability of chromatin binding and DN activity. Our studies suggest that oncogenic fusion proteins that retain the DBD of the transcription factor (TF) and the multimerization sequence of the partner protein can act in a DN manner by multimerizing and binding avidly to gene targets, preventing the normal TF from binding and inducing expression of its target genes. Inhibition of this multimeriztion may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancers with this or similar fusion proteins.	0
Founder BRCA1/2 mutations in the Europe: implications for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer prevention and control. ||  || Detection of mutations in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer-related BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is an effective method of cancer prevention and early detection. Different ethnic and geographical regions have different BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation spectrum and prevalence. Along with the emerging targeted therapy, demand and uptake for rapid BRCA1/2 mutations testing will increase in a near future. However, current patients selection and genetic testing strategies in most countries impose significant lag in this practice. The knowledge of the genetic structure of particular populations is important for the developing of effective screening protocol and may provide more efficient approach for the individualization of genetic testing. Elucidating of founder effect in BRCA1/2 genes can have an impact on the management of hereditary cancer families on a national and international healthcare system level, making genetic testing more affordable and cost-effective. The purpose of this review is to summarize current evidence about the BRCA1/2 founder mutations diversity in European populations.	4
What can we learn about lipoprotein metabolism and coronary heart disease from studying rare variants? || Animals Coronary Artery Disease DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Discovery Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genome-Wide Association Study Humans Lipoproteins Molecular Targeted Therapy Mutation || Rare variant association studies (RVAS) target the class of genetic variation with frequencies less than 1%. Recently, investigators have used exome sequencing in RVAS to identify rare alleles responsible for Mendelian diseases but have experienced greater difficulty discovering such alleles for complex diseases. In this review, we describe what we have learned about lipoprotein metabolism and coronary heart disease through the conduct of RVAS. Rare protein-altering genetic variation can provide important insights that are not as easily attainable from common variant association studies. First, RVAS can facilitate gene discovery by identifying novel rare protein-altering variants in specific genes that are associated with disease. Second, rare variant associations can provide supportive evidence for putative drug targets for novel therapies. Finally, rare variants can uncover new pathways and reveal new biologic mechanisms. The field of human genetics has already made tremendous progress in understanding lipoprotein metabolism and the causes of coronary heart disease in the context of rare variants. As next generation sequencing becomes more cost-effective, RVAS with larger sample sizes will be conducted. This will lead to more novel rare variant discoveries and the translation of genomic data into biological knowledge and clinical insights for cardiovascular disease.	4
Identification of a Novel Mutation in the PAH Gene in an Iranian Phenylketonuria Family: A Case Report. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism with an autosomal recessive inheritance caused in most cases by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. PKU has wide allelic heterogeneity. Here we report a novel heterozygous substitution (c.1223G>T (p.Arg408Leu)) in the PAH gene in an Iranian PKU family. The patient was 19-yr-old female with diagnosis of moderate PKU referred to Department of Medical Genetics, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran for genetic counseling/analysis in April 2015. We used PCR-Sequencing to identify any sequence variations in the PAH gene.	1 3
Ethnic differences in the frequency of the cardioprotective C679X PCSK9 mutation in a West African population. || African Continental Ancestry Group Benin Burkina Faso Cholesterol, LDL Codon, Nonsense Coronary Disease Gene Frequency Heterozygote Humans Mutation Population Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Serine Endopeptidases Togo || PCSK9 is a liver-secreted blood protein that promotes the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors, leading to reduced hepatic uptake of plasma cholesterol. Nucleotide variations in its gene have been linked to hypo- and hyper-cholesterolemia. Two nonsense mutations, Y142X and C679X, are associated to lifelong hypocholesterolemia and a remarkable protection against coronary heart disease (CHD) in African Americans. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of these cardioprotective mutations in West Africans. Subjects (n = 520) from different ethnic groups were recruited in Burkina-Faso, Benin, and Togo. Only the C679X mutation was detected. All carriers were heterozygous. The overall heterozygosity frequency was 3.3%. It varied significantly among ethnic groups, ranging from 0% to 6.9%. The overall high frequency of the cardioprotective C679X mutation in Africa may contribute to the lower incidence of CHD on this continent. The interethnic frequency differences may reflect historical settlement and migration patterns in the region, possibly combined with positive selection for the mutation driven by yet-unknown environmental factors.	4
[Analysis of clinical phenotypes and GJB2 gene mutations in families affected with hearing loss from southern Zhejiang]. ||  || To analyze the clinical features and pathological mutations in 44 families affected with hearing loss from southern Zhejiang, and to provide genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis for 6 of the families. Microarray was employed to detect c.35delG, c.176del16, c.235delC and c.299-300delAT mutations of the GJB2 gene among 228 patients. For those carrying a single heterozygous mutation, the whole coding region of the GJB2 gene was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. For prenatal diagnosis, maternal DNA contamination was excluded by application of STR analysis. The microarray assay has detected 49 patients with GJB2 mutations, which included 24 homozygous c.235delC mutations, 5 compound heterozygous c.235delC/c.176del16 mutations, 2 compound heterozygous c.235delC/c.299-300delAT mutations. Respectively, 16, 1 and 1 patients have carried single heterozygous c.235delC, c.176del16, and c.299-300delAT mutation. For the 16 patients, 7, 1, 1, 2, and 3 were detected by Sanger sequencing with a second heterozygous mutation of c.109G>A (2 of which were in conjunction with heterozygous c.176del16 and c.299-300delAT mutations), c.230G>A, c.427C>T, c.508-511 dupAACG, 79G>A+341A>G, respectively. Prenatal diagnosis revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in a fetus, heterozygous mutations in 4 fetuses, and no mutation of the GJB2 gene in 1 fetus. The proportion of carriers for GJB2 gene mutations in patients with hearing loss from southern Zhejiang has reached 21.5%. The c.235delC, c.176del16, and compound c.299-300delAT and c.109G>A mutations can cause moderate to severe hearing loss. In most affected families, Heterozygous mutations may be identified by sequencing the whole coding region of the GJB2 gene. Genetic analysis and prenatal diagnosis can prevent birth of further affected children.	4
Genotype-Dependent and -Independent Calcium Signaling Dysregulation in Human Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. || Calcium Signaling Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2 Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Case-Control Studies Down-Regulation Gene Expression Genotype Humans RNA, Messenger Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel Sarcomeres Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases || Aberrant calcium signaling may contribute to arrhythmias and adverse remodeling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Mutations in sarcomere genes may distinctly alter calcium handling pathways. We analyzed gene expression, protein levels, and functional assays for calcium regulatory pathways in human HCM surgical samples with (n=25) and without (n=10) sarcomere mutations compared with control hearts (n=8). Gene expression and protein levels for calsequestrin, L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium exchanger, phospholamban, calcineurin, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) were similar in HCM samples compared with controls. CaMKII protein abundance was increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (P<0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (P=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (P<0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (PPP3CB) mRNA was not increased, nor was RCAN1 mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII protein abundance or activation. SERCA2A mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2/phospholamban protein ratio (45% reduced; P=0.03). 45Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (P=0.01). The cardiac ryanodine receptor was not altered in transcript, protein, or phosphorylated (pS2808, pS2814) protein abundance, and [3H]ryanodine binding was not different in HCM, consistent with no major modification of the ryanodine receptor. Human HCM demonstrates calcium mishandling through both genotype-specific and common pathways. Posttranslational activation of the CaMKII pathway is specific to sarcomere mutation-positive HCM, whereas sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2 abundance and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca uptake are depressed in both sarcomere mutation-positive and -negative HCM.	0
Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome: does genotype predict phenotype? ||  || Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is a sporadic multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation condition principally caused by mutations in BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2. Mutations in KRAS and SHOC2 lead to a phenotype with overlapping features. In approximately 10–30% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CFC, a mutation in one of these causative genes is not found. Cardinal features of CFC include congenital heart defects, a characteristic facial appearance, and ectodermal abnormalities. Additional features include failure to thrive with severe feeding problems, moderate to severe intellectual disability and short stature with relative macrocephaly. First described in 1986, more than 100 affected individuals are reported. Following the discovery of the causative genes, more information has emerged on the breadth of clinical features. Little, however, has been published on genotype–phenotype correlations. This clinical study of 186 children and young adults with mutation-proven CFC syndrome is the largest reported to date. BRAF mutations are documented in 140 individuals (approximately 75%), while 46 (approximately 25%) have a mutation in MEK 1 or MEK 2. The age range is 6 months to 32 years, the oldest individual being a female from the original report [Reynolds et al. (1986); Am J Med Genet 25:413–427]. While some clinical data on 136 are in the literature, 50 are not previously published. We provide new details of the breadth of phenotype and discuss the frequency of particular features in each genotypic group. Pulmonary stenosis is the only anomaly that demonstrates a statistically significant genotype–phenotype correlation, being more common in individuals with a BRAF mutation.	4
Diagnostic value of exome and whole genome sequencing in craniosynostosis. || Craniosynostoses Exome Genetic Testing Genome, Human High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Predictive Value of Tests || Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, occurs in ∼1 in 2250 births, either in isolation or as part of a syndrome. Mutations in at least 57 genes have been associated with craniosynostosis, but only a minority of these are included in routine laboratory genetic testing. We used exome or whole genome sequencing to seek a genetic cause in a cohort of 40 subjects with craniosynostosis, selected by clinical or molecular geneticists as being high-priority cases, and in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. We identified likely associated mutations in 15 patients (37.5%), involving 14 different genes. All genes were mutated in single families, except for IL11RA (two families). We classified the other positive diagnoses as follows: commonly mutated craniosynostosis genes with atypical presentation (EFNB1,TWIST1); other core craniosynostosis genes (CDC45,MSX2, ZIC1); genes for which mutations are only rarely associated with craniosynostosis (FBN1,HUWE1,KRAS,STAT3); and known disease genes for which a causal relationship with craniosynostosis is currently unknown (AHDC1,NTRK2). In two further families, likely novel disease genes are currently undergoing functional validation. In 5 of the 15 positive cases, the (previously unanticipated) molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences for either genetic or medical management (mutations inEFNB1,FBN1,KRAS,NTRK2, STAT3). This substantial genetic heterogeneity, and the multiple actionable mutations identified, emphasises the benefits of exome/whole genome sequencing to identify causal mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has yielded negative results.	4
High throughput RNAi screening identifies ID1 as a synthetic sick/lethal gene interacting with the common TP53 mutation R175H. || Cell Proliferation Epistasis, Genetic G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Gene Knockdown Techniques Genes, Lethal HCT116 Cells Humans Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1 Mutation, Missense RNA Interference RNA, Small Interfering Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The TP53 mutation (R175H) is one of the most common mutations in human cancer. It is a highly attractive strategy for cancer therapy to find the genes that lead the R175H-expressing cancer cells. The aim of this study was to identify the synthetic sick/lethal gene interacting with R175H. Using lentiviral bar-coded comprehensive shRNA library and a tetracycline-inducible R175H expressed in the SF126 human glioblastoma cell line (SF126-tet-R175H), we conducted high-throughput screening to identify the candidate genes that induce synthetic sickness/lethality in R175H-expressing cells. We identified 906 candidate gene suppressions that may lead to accelerated cell growth inhibition in the presence of R175H. Inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1) was one of the candidate genes, and its suppression by siRNA resulted in the acceleration of growth inhibition in cell lines both transiently and endogenously expressing R175H but not in TP53-null cell lines or other common p53 mutants (such as R273H). Flow cytometry analysis showed that ID1 suppression resulted in G1 arrest, and the arrest was accelerated by the expression of R175H. ID1 is a synthetic sick/lethal gene that interacts with R175H and is considered to be a novel molecular target for cancer therapy in R175H-expressing cells.	0
Identification of novel mutations including a double mutation in patients with inherited cardiomyopathy by a targeted sequencing approach using the Ion Torrent PGM system. || AMP-Activated Protein Kinases Actins Adolescent Adult Aged Animals Automation, Laboratory Base Sequence Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Child Female Genome-Wide Association Study Heterozygote Humans Lamin Type A Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree Protein Isoforms Sequence Analysis, DNA Tropomyosin Troponin || Inherited cardiomyopathy is the major cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and heart failure (HF). The disease is associated with extensive genetic heterogeneity; pathogenic mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes, cytoskeletal protein genes and nuclear envelope protein genes have been linked to its etiology. Early diagnosis is conducive to clinical monitoring and allows for presymptomatic interventions as needed. In the present study, the entire coding sequences and flanking regions of 12 major disease (cardiomyopathy)-related genes [namely myosin, heavy chain 7, cardiac muscle, β (MYH7); myosin binding protein C, cardiac (MYBPC3); lamin A/C (LMNA); troponin I type 3 (cardiac) (TNNI3); troponin T type 2 (cardiac) (TNNT2); actin, α, cardiac muscle 1 (ACTC1); tropomyosin 1 (α) (TPM1); sodium channel, voltage gated, type V alpha subunit (SCN5A); myosin, light chain 2, regulatory, cardiac, slow (MYL2); myosin, heavy chain 6, cardiac muscle, α (MYH6); myosin, light chain 3, alkali, ventricular, skeletal, slow (MYL3); and protein kinase, AMP-activated, gamma 2 non-catalytic subunit (PRKAG2)] in 8 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and in 8 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were amplified and then sequenced using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) system. As a result, a novel heterozygous mutation (MYH7, p.Asn885Thr) and a variant of uncertain significance (TNNT2, p.Arg296His) were identified in 2 patients with HCM. These 2 missense mutations, which were absent in the samples obtained from the 200 healthy control subjects, altered the amino acid that was evolutionarily conserved among a number of vertebrate species; this illustrates that these 2 non-synonymous mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of HCM. Moreover, a double heterozygous mutation (PRKAG2, p.Gly100Ser plus MYH7, p.Arg719Trp) was identified in a patient with severe familial HCM, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. This patient provided us with more information regarding the genotype-phenotype correlation between mutations of MYH7 and PRKAG2. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying inherited cardiomyopathy. The mutations identified in this study may be further investigated in the future in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with inherited cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, our findings indicated that sequencing using the Ion Torrent PGM system is a useful approach for the identification of pathogenic mutations associated with inherited cardiomyopathy, and it may be used for the risk evaluation of individuals with a possible susceptibility to inherited cardiomyopathy.	4
A study of FHL1, BAG3, MATR3, PTRF and TCAP in Australian muscular dystrophy patients. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Australia Cohort Studies Connectin DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins LIM Domain Proteins Male Muscle Proteins Muscular Dystrophies Mutation Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins Phenotype RNA-Binding Proteins || FHL1, BAG3, MATR3 and PTRF are recently identified myopathy genes associated with phenotypes that overlap muscular dystrophy. TCAP is a rare reported cause of muscular dystrophy not routinely screened in most centres. We hypothesised that these genes may account for patients with undiagnosed forms of muscular dystrophy in Australia. We screened a large cohort of muscular dystrophy patients for abnormalities in FHL1 (n=102) and TCAP (n=100) and selected patients whose clinical features overlapped the phenotypes previously described for BAG3 (n=9), MATR3 (n=15) and PTRF (n=7). We found one FHL1 mutation (c.311G>A, p.C104Y) in a boy with rapidly progressive muscle weakness and reducing body myopathy who was initially diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. We identified no pathogenic mutations in BAG3, MATR3, PTRF or TCAP. In conclusion, we have excluded these five genes as common causes of muscular dystrophy in Australia. Patients with reducing body myopathy may be initially diagnosed as muscular dystrophy.	4
Lung MRI and impairment of diaphragmatic function in Pompe disease. || Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Diaphragm Exhalation Female Forced Expiratory Volume Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Inhalation Lung Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Spirometry Vital Capacity || Pompe disease is a progressive metabolic myopathy. Involvement of respiratory muscles leads to progressive pulmonary dysfunction, particularly in supine position. Diaphragmatic weakness is considered to be the most important component. Standard spirometry is to some extent indicative but provides too little insight into diaphragmatic dynamics. We used lung MRI to study diaphragmatic and chest-wall movements in Pompe disease. In ten adult Pompe patients and six volunteers, we acquired two static spirometer-controlled MRI scans during maximum inspiration and expiration. Images were manually segmented. After normalization for lung size, changes in lung dimensions between inspiration and expiration were used for analysis; normalization was based on the cranial-caudal length ratio (representing vertical diaphragmatic displacement), and the anterior-posterior and left-right length ratios (representing chest-wall movements due to thoracic muscles). We observed striking dysfunction of the diaphragm in Pompe patients; in some patients the diaphragm did not show any displacement. Patients had smaller cranial-caudal length ratios than volunteers (p < 0.001), indicating diaphragmatic weakness. This variable strongly correlated with forced vital capacity in supine position (r = 0.88) and postural drop (r = 0.89). While anterior-posterior length ratios also differed between patients and volunteers (p = 0.04), left-right length ratios did not (p = 0.1). MRI is an innovative tool to visualize diaphragmatic dynamics in Pompe patients and to study chest-walland diaphragmatic movements in more detail. Our data indicate that diaphragmatic displacement may be severely disturbed in patients with Pompe disease.	1
Survivin family proteins as novel molecular determinants of doxorubicin resistance in organotypic human breast tumors. || Alternative Splicing Antibiotics, Antineoplastic Antineoplastic Agents Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Camptothecin Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Cell Survival DNA Damage Doxorubicin Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Etoposide Female High-Throughput Screening Assays Humans Imidazoles Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins MCF-7 Cells Naphthoquinones Paclitaxel Receptor, ErbB-2 Survivin Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The molecular determinants of breast cancer resistance to first-line anthracycline-containing chemotherapy are unknown. We examined the response to doxorubicin of organotypic cultures of primary human breast tumors ex vivo with respect to cell proliferation, DNA damage and modulation of apoptosis. Samples were analyzed for genome-wide modulation of cell death pathways, differential activation of p53, and the role of survivin family molecules in drug resistance. Rational drug combination regimens were explored by high-throughput screening, and validated in model breast cancer cell types. Doxorubicin treatment segregated organotypic human breast tumors into distinct Responder or Non Responder groups, characterized by differential proliferative index, stabilization of p53, and induction of apoptosis. Conversely, tumor histotype, hormone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status did not influence chemotherapy sensitivity. Global analysis of cell death pathways identified survivin and its alternatively spliced form, survivin-ΔEx3 as uniquely overexpressed in Non Responder breast tumors. Forced expression of survivin-ΔEx3 preserved cell viability and prevented doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell types. High-throughput pharmacologic targeting of survivin family proteins with a small-molecule survivin suppressant currently in the clinic (YM155) selectively potentiated the effect of doxorubicin, but not other chemotherapeutics in breast cancer cell types, and induced tumor cell apoptosis. Survivin family proteins are novel effectors of doxorubicin resistance in chemotherapy-naive breast cancer. The incorporation of survivin antagonist(s) in anthracycline-containing regimens may have improved clinical activity in these patients.	0
Mutation location on the RAS oncogene affects pathologic features and survival after resection of colorectal liver metastases. || Carcinogenesis Cell Movement Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Colorectal Neoplasms Disease-Free Survival Exons Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Liver Neoplasms Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Recurrence, Local Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || In the past 3 decades, a better understanding of gene mutations and their role in carcinogenesis has led to improvement in our ability to treat patients with metastatic disease. The objective of the current study was to determine whether the location of a driver mutation within an affected gene impacts the biology of metastatic colorectal cancer. DNA was collected from 165 randomly selected specimens of patients who underwent margin-negative resection of colorectal liver metastases with curative intent. Sequenom analysis and Sanger sequencing were used to evaluate mutations in K/NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and TP53. BRAF mutation was associated with early recurrence and death, whereas no impact of TP53 or PIK3CA mutation was identified. Although K/NRAS mutation was associated with worse survival in this cohort, this difference was no longer evident when those who had received anti-EGFR therapy were excluded. When stratifying patients according to the exon on which K/NRAS was mutated, there were dramatic differences in both survival and pathologic features. Exon 4 mutations were associated with large, solitary metastases occurring at long disease-free intervals compared with exon 3 mutations, which presented with small, numerous lesions. Patients who had exon 4 mutations recurred infrequently and had significantly longer survival compared with those who had wild type or other mutations. By using this model of curative-intent, margin-negative resection in patients at high risk of recurrence, the authors were able to establish a link between mutation location within the K/NRAS gene and the biology of metastatic colorectal cancer.

Practically, BRAF mutation status (V600E) is commonly screened although other non-V600E mutations (i.e., K-R-M-D) could be found in some patients who respond to therapy equally to the patients harboring V600E mutations. Furthermore, other mutations, namely, N-RAS, KIT, and GNAQ, should be sequenced according to distinct melanoma specific subtypes and clinical aspects. In our report, a practical flow chart is described along with our experience in this field.	4
Altered CO2 sensitivity of connexin26 mutant hemichannels in vitro. || Carbon Dioxide Connexin 26 Connexins Deafness HeLa Cells Hearing Loss Humans Ichthyosis Intercellular Junctions Keratitis Mutation Respiratory Physiological Phenomena || Connexin26 (Cx26) mutations underlie human pathologies ranging from hearing loss to keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome. Cx26 hemichannels are directly gated by CO2 and contribute to the chemosensory regulation of breathing. The KID syndrome mutation A88V is insensitive to CO2, and has a dominant negative action on the CO2 sensitivity of Cx26WT hemichannels, and reduces respiratory drive in humans. We have now examined the effect of further human mutations of Cx26 on its sensitivity to CO2 : Mutated Cx26 subunits, carrying one of A88S, N14K, N14Y, M34T, or V84L, were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. The CO2-dependence of hemichannel activity, and their ability to exert dominant negative actions on cells stably expressing Cx26WT, was quantified by a dye-loading assay. The KID syndrome mutation, N14K, abolished the sensitivity of Cx26 to CO2 Both N14Y and N14K exerted a powerful dominant negative action on the CO2 sensitivity of Cx26WT None of the other mutations (all recessive) had a dominant negative action. A88S shifted the affinity of Cx26 to slightly higher levels without reducing its ability to fully open to CO2 M34T did not change the affinity of Cx26 for CO2 but reduced its ability to open in response to CO2 V84L had no effect on the CO2-sensitivity of Cx26. Some pathological mutations of Cx26 can therefore alter the CO2 sensitivity of Cx26 hemichannels. The loss of CO2 sensitivity could contribute to pathology and consequent reduced respiratory drive could be an unrecognized comorbidity of these pathologies.	0
Transcriptome profiling identifies genes and pathways deregulated upon floxuridine treatment in colorectal cancer cells harboring GOF mutant p53. ||  || Mutation in TP53 is a common genetic alteration in human cancers. Certain tumor associated p53 missense mutants acquire gain-of-function (GOF) properties and confer oncogenic phenotypes including enhanced chemoresistance. The colorectal cancers (CRC) harboring mutant p53 are generally aggressive in nature and difficult to treat. To identify a potential gene expression signature of GOF mutant p53-driven acquired chemoresistance in CRC, we performed transcriptome profiling of floxuridine (FUdR) treated SW480 cells expressing mutant p53(R273H) (GEO#: GSE77533). We obtained several genes differentially regulated between FUdR treated and untreated cells. Further, functional characterization and pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of crucial biological processes and pathways upon FUdR treatment in SW480 cells. Our data suggest that in response to chemotherapeutics treatment, cancer cells with GOF mutant p53 can modulate key cellular pathways to withstand the cytotoxic effect of the drugs. The genes and pathways identified in the present study can be further validated and targeted for better chemotherapy response in colorectal cancer patients harboring mutant p53.	0
Epileptic spasms in PPP1CB-associated Noonan-like syndrome: a case report with clinical and therapeutic implications. || Craniofacial Abnormalities Developmental Disabilities Diet, Ketogenic Heterozygote Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Infant, Newborn, Diseases Intellectual Disability Male Muscle Hypotonia Mutation Neuroimaging Protein Phosphatase 1 Spasms, Infantile || Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair-2 (NSLH2) is an extremely rare disease caused by a heterozygous mutation in the PPP1CB gene on chromosome 2p23. The syndrome causes not only numerous dysmorphic features but also hypotonia, developmental delay, and even intellectual disability. We report the first case of NSLH2 in Asia and the 16th in the world. Moreover, the first case of PPP1CB-related infantile spasms. The clinical and therapeutic significance is outlined in this paper. We found a male infant presented with severe intractable epileptic spasms. Although certain clinical features of somatic dysmorphism were noted, numerous laboratory and neuroimaging studies failed to identify the cause. To determine the underlying etiology, whole-exome sequencing was conducted. We identified a de novo heterozygous mutation, NM_206876.1: c.548A > C (p.Glu183Ala), in the PPP1CB gene. His seizures were almost refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs but relative seizure control was eventually achieved with a ketogenic diet. This result expands the clinical spectrum of NSLH2 and strengthens the association between the PPP1CB gene and epileptic seizures. Furthermore, we suggest that the ketogenic diet can offer seizure reduction in particular drug-resistant epilepsy syndromes. Additional studies are warranted to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this PPP1CB mutation in epileptic seizures.	4

Tumor suppressor protein p53-mediated repression of human mitotic centromere-associated kinesin gene expression is exerted via down-regulation of Sp1 level. || Centromere HCT116 Cells Humans Kinesin MCF-7 Cells Mitosis Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Binding Sp1 Transcription Factor Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The repressive role of p53 on the human mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) core promoter from ‒266 to +54, relative to the transcription start site, has been determined. The MCAK mRNA and protein levels were 2.1- and 3.0-fold higher, respectively, in HCT116 (p53‒/‒) than in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells. Enforced down-regulation of p53 levels either in HCT116 (p53+/+) cells by p53 RNAi treatment or in MCF-7 cells using shRNA for p53 (shp53) resulted in a remarkable increase in the MCAK protein level. Site-directed mutagenesis and ChIP analyses showed that p53-mediated repression of the MCAK core promoter activity was not directly exerted by p53-binding to putative p53-response elements (p53-RE1 at -173/-166 and p53-RE2 at -245/-238), but indirectly by attenuating Sp1 binding to GC-motifs (GC1 at -93/-84 and GC2 at -119/-110). Treatment of HEK-293 cells bearing the MCAK core promoter-reporter (pGL2-320-Luc) with mithramycin A, which down-regulates Sp1 gene expression, reduced the promoter activity as well as endogenous MCAK levels. Exposure of HCT116 (p53+/+) cells to nutlin-3a, a validated activator of p53, caused a simultaneous reduction in Sp1 and MCAK protein levels, but not in HCT116 (p53-/-) cells. In contrast to wild-type (wt)-p53, tumor-derived p53 mutants (p53V143A, p53R248W, and p53R273H) failed to repress the Sp1-dependent activation of the MCAK promoter and to down-regulate endogenous levels of Sp1 and MCAK proteins. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that p53 can repress MCAK promoter activity indirectly via down-regulation of Sp1 expression level, and suggest that MCAK elevation in human tumor cells might be due to p53 mutation.	0
Characterization of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene mutations in Albania. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a clinical syndrome characterised by elevated serum total cholesterol (TCHOL) levels due to an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, by tendon xanthomata and clinical manifestations of ischaemic heart disease in early life. Typically, it results from mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. So far, more than 800 mutations have been reported for the LDLR gene and account for FH. The nature of LDLR gene mutations varies among different ethnicities. Until now no mutations of LDLR have been reported in the Albanian population. We assessed the contribution of the LDLR gene mutations as causes of FH in an Albanian population. Fifty probands with a clinical diagnosis of FH were included. We analysed all the exons and the promoter of the LDLR gene by using restriction isotyping or direct sequencing. Twenty-one patients were heterozygous for the 1646G>A mutation (FH Genoa) in exon 11 and 9 patients were heterozygous for the 81T>C mutation in exon 2 of the LDLR gene. This report describes two LDLR gene mutations accounting for FH in Albania (1646G>A, 81T>C).	4
Frequency and distribution of phenylketonuric mutations in Orientals. ||  || The frequency and distribution of eight mutations (R111X, IVS4nt-1, Y204C, R243Q, IVS7nt-2, W326X, Y356X, and R413P) in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene of Orientals in Japan and Korea were examined by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. The mutant alleles comprised 54 and 55% of the phenylketonuria (PKU) chromosomes examined in 36 patients in Japan and 10 patients in Korea, respectively. The spectrum of PKU mutations in Japan was similar to that in China, particularly in northern China, but different from that in Korea. The IVS4nt-1 mutation had a high frequency in Korea and southern China, due to the result of the founder effect and genetic drift. The R413P mutation, which may have originated in the regions surrounding the Baikal, expanded to northern China and Japan. We did not find Caucasian mutations in the Japanese or Korean PKU chromosomes. Thus, PKU mutations occurred after racial divergence between Caucasians and Mongoloids, and there were different founding populations for PKU in the two populations.	3
Type II RAF inhibitor causes superior ERK pathway suppression compared to type I RAF inhibitor in cells expressing different BRAF mutant types recurrently found in lung cancer. ||  || A large fraction of somatic driver BRAF mutations in lung cancer are non-V600 and impaired-kinase. Non-V600 BRAF mutations predict sensitivity to combination of a type I RAF inhibitor, Dabrafenib, and a MEK inhibitor, Trametinib. Singly, Dabrafenib only weakly suppresses mutant BRAF-induced ERK signaling and can induce ERK paradoxical activation in CRAF-overexpressing cells. The present study compared the effects of Dabrafenib and a type II RAF inhibitor, AZ628, on ERK activity in HEK293T cells expressing several tumor-derived BRAF mutants, and in a non-V600 and impaired-kinase BRAF-mutant lung cancer cell line (H1666). Unlike Dabrafenib, AZ628 did not induce paradoxical ERK activation in CRAF-overexpressing cells and BRAF-mutant cells overexpressing CRAF were more responsive to AZ628 compared to Dabrafenib in terms of ERK inhibition. AZ628 inhibited ERK more effectively than Dabrafenib in both H1666 cells and HEK293T cells co-expressing several different BRAF-mutants with CRAF. Similarly, AZ628 plus Trametinib had better MEK-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects in H1666 cells than Dabrafenib plus Trametinib. Moreover, prolonged treatment of H1666 cells with AZ628 plus Trametinib produced greater inhibition of cell growth than Dabrafenib plus Trametinib. These results indicate that AZ628 has greater potential than Dabrafenib, both as a single agent and combined with Trametinib, for the treatment of non-V600 BRAF mutant lung cancer.	0
Prodigiosin rescues deficient p53 signaling and antitumor effects via upregulating p73 and disrupting its interaction with mutant p53. || Animals DNA-Binding Proteins Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, Tumor Suppressor Genes, p53 HCT116 Cells Humans Mice Mice, Nude Mutant Proteins Nuclear Proteins Prodigiosin Protein Binding Signal Transduction Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Protein p73 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins Up-Regulation Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || p53 reactivation offers a broad-based strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we report the identification of prodigiosin that can reactivate p53 family-dependent transcriptional activity in p53-deficient human colon cancer cells. Prodigiosin and its structural analogue (compound R) induced the expression of p53 target genes accompanied by cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells. Prodigiosin restored p53 signaling in cancer cells harboring hotspot TP53 mutations, with little to no detectable cytotoxicity in normal human fibroblasts and with no genotoxicity. Prodigiosin induced the expression of p73 and disrupted its interaction with mutant p53, thereby rescuing p53 pathway deficiency and promoting antitumor effects. The disruption of mutant p53/p73 interaction was specific to prodigiosin and not related to mTOR inhibition. Our findings suggest that mutant p53 needs to be targeted in the context of p73 stimulation to allow efficient restoration of the p53 pathway. In exhibiting this capability, prodigiosin and its analogue provide lead compounds to rescue deficiencies in the p53 pathway in cancer cells by upregulating p73 and targeting mutant p53/p73 interaction there.	0
Exhaustive analysis of the P53 gene coding sequence by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis: application to the detection of point mutations in acute leukemias. ||  || We report the set-up of a denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) assay to screen for mutations in the whole coding sequence of the p53 gene. These DGGE experimental conditions were applied to the analysis of the p53 gene in acute leukemias. Forty adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 21 with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) were investigated. Eleven of the AML patients were investigated at the time of the initial diagnosis and at relapse. In contrast with most reports based on amplified fragments analyzed by single-strand conformation electrophoresis and focusing on exons 5 to 8, we analyzed the whole coding sequence of the gene. Two of the 40 AML patients displayed a point mutation in exon 7; it was either an A to G substitution that converted Tyr-234 to Cys, or a G to A change that converted Arg-248 to Gln. The screening procedure led to the discovery of several intronic and exonic polymorphisms. These results confirm the low incidence of p53 mutations in acute leukemias and suggest a limited role of the p53 protein in leukemogenesis. The computerized modeling and electrophoresis parameters presented here provide a powerful tool for the exhaustive characterization of p53 mutants in all kinds of malignancies.	4
Potential therapeutic targets of TP53 gene in the context of its classically canonical functions and its latest non-canonical functions in human cancer. ||  || In normal tissue, p53 protein has a wide range of functions involving cell homeostasis; its mutation, however, permits a carcinogenic acquisition of function. TP53 gene mutation is a major genomic aberration in various human cancers and is a critical event in the multi-step carcinogenesis process.TP53 mutation is clinically relevant for the molecular classification of carcinogenesis, as most recently described rigorously by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.TP53 gene mutation has been considered to work as a tumor suppressor gene through the loss of its transcriptional activity, which is designated as a canonical function. However, in cancer patients with mutantTP53, mutated p53 protein is frequently overexpressed, suggesting the activation of an oncogenic process through a gain of function (GOF). As part of this GOF, molecular mechanisms explaining the non-canonical function ofTP53 gene abnormality have been reported, in which mutant p53 unconventionally binds with various critical molecules suppressing oncogenic properties, such as p63 and p73. Moreover, mutantTP53 gene-targeted therapy has been rigorously developed, and promising clinical trials have been started. In this study, we summarize the novel aspects of mutant p53 and describe its prominent therapeutic potentials in human cancer.	0
PIK3CA-associated developmental disorders exhibit distinct classes of mutations with variable expression and tissue distribution. || Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Female Genetic Association Studies High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Infant Male Malformations of Cortical Development Mosaicism Mutation Phenotype Tissue Distribution Vascular Malformations || Mosaicism is increasingly recognized as a cause of developmental disorders with the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Mosaic mutations of PIK3CA have been associated with the widest spectrum of phenotypes associated with overgrowth and vascular malformations. We performed targeted NGS using 2 independent deep-coverage methods that utilize molecular inversion probes and amplicon sequencing in a cohort of 241 samples from 181 individuals with brain and/or body overgrowth. We identifiedPIK3CA mutations in 60 individuals. Several other individuals (n = 12) were identified separately to have mutations inPIK3CA by clinical targeted-panel testing (n = 6), whole-exome sequencing (n = 5), or Sanger sequencing (n = 1). Based on the clinical and molecular features, this cohort segregated into three distinct groups: (a) severe focal overgrowth due to low-level but highly activating (hotspot) mutations, (b) predominantly brain overgrowth and less severe somatic overgrowth due to less-activating mutations, and (c) intermediate phenotypes (capillary malformations with overgrowth) with intermediately activating mutations. Sixteen of 29PIK3CA mutations were novel. We also identified constitutionalPIK3CA mutations in 10 patients. Our molecular data, combined with review of the literature, show thatPIK3CA-related overgrowth disorders comprise a discontinuous spectrum of disorders that correlate with the severity and distribution of mutations.	4
Initial testing (stage 1) of the PARP inhibitor BMN 673 by the pediatric preclinical testing program: PALB2 mutation predicts exceptional in vivo response to BMN 673. || Animals Bone Neoplasms Drug Evaluation, Preclinical Enzyme Inhibitors Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group N Protein Female Glioblastoma Humans Mice Mutation Neuroblastoma Nuclear Proteins Phthalazines Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors Rhabdomyosarcoma Sarcoma, Ewing Tumor Suppressor Proteins || BMN 673 is a potent inhibitor of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) that is in clinical testing with a primary focus on BRCA-mutated cancers. BMN 673 is active both through inhibiting PARP catalytic activity and by tightly trapping PARP to DNA at sites of single strand breaks. BMN 673 was tested in vitro at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 μM and in vivo at a daily dose of 0.33 mg/kg administered orally twice daily (Mon-Fri) and once daily on weekends (solid tumors) for 28 days. The median relative IC50 (rIC50 ) concentration against the PPTP cell lines was 25.8 nM. The median rIC50 for the Ewing cell lines was lower than for the remaining cell lines (6.4 vs. 31.1 nM, respectively). In vivo BMN 673 induced statistically significant differences in EFS distribution in 17/43 (39.5%) xenograft models. Three objective regressions were observed: a complete response (CR) in a medulloblastoma line (BT-45), a maintained CR in a Wilms tumor line (KT-10), and a maintained CR in an ependymoma line (BT-41). BMN 673 maintained its high level of activity against KT-10 with a threefold reduction in dose. KT-10 possesses a truncating mutation in PALB2 analogous to PALB2 mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer that abrogate homologous recombination (HR) repair. The PPTP results suggest that single agent BMN 673 may have limited clinical activity against pediatric cancers. Single agent activity is more likely for patients whose tumors have defects in HR repair.	0
Prevalence of Mutations in Deafness-Causing Genes in Cochlear Implanted Patients with Profound Nonsyndromic Sensorineural Hearing Loss in Shandong Province, China. || Adolescent Adult Aged Alleles Child Child, Preschool China Cochlear Implantation Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Female Gene Frequency Genetic Testing Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Prevalence Sulfate Transporters Young Adult || The mutations of GJB2, SLC26A4, and mtDNA12SrRNA are the most common inherited causes of nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL) in China, yet previous genetic screenings were mainly carried on patients with moderate-to-profound impairment. We aimed to detect the mutation frequencies in NSHL population within a more specified range of severity. Patients with profound NSHL who had undergone cochlear implantation in the Shandong Provincial Hospital (Shandong, China) were recruited. The majority (n = 472) were between 0.7 and 6 years old, and the remaining (n = 63) were between 6 and 70 years old. In total, 115 mutation alleles of the three genes were screened with SNP scan assay. Of the patients, 19.44% (104/535) were found to have GJB2 mutations, and the most common allele was c.235delC, followed by c.299_300delAT and c.109G>A. SLC26A4 mutations were detected in 13.46% patients (72/535), and the most common allele was c.919-2A>G (IVS7-2A>G), followed by c.1174A>T and c.2168A>G. Seven patients (1.31%) carried mutations in mtDNA12SrRNA, with the alleles of m.1555A>G and m.1494C>T. We found the allele frequency of c.109G>A (GJB2) was relatively lower in the profound NSHL population in comparison to the moderate-to-profound ones, and the c.1174A>T (SLC26A4) relatively higher. It suggests those mutations may be connected with the degree of deafness, which needs more observations and analyses to support.	4
Genetic Heterogeneity in Therapy-Naïve Synchronous Primary Breast Cancers and Their Metastases. || Adult Bone Neoplasms Breast Neoplasms Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Clonal Evolution DNA Copy Number Variations Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Exome Female GATA3 Transcription Factor Genetic Heterogeneity Genomics High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Liver Neoplasms Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Metastasis Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Purpose: Paired primary breast cancers and metachronous metastases after adjuvant treatment are reported to differ in their clonal composition and genetic alterations, but it is unclear whether these differences stem from the selective pressures of the metastatic process, the systemic therapies, or both. We sought to define the repertoire of genetic alterations in breast cancer patients withde novo metastatic disease who had not received local or systemic therapy.Experimental Design: Up to two anatomically distinct core biopsies of primary breast cancers and synchronous distant metastases from nine patients who presented with metastatic disease were subjected to high-depth whole-exome sequencing. Mutations, copy number alterations and their cancer cell fractions, and mutation signatures were defined using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods. All mutations identified were validated with orthogonal methods.Results: Genomic differences were observed between primary and metastatic deposits, with a median of 60% (range 6%-95%) of shared somatic mutations. Although mutations in known driver genes includingTP53, PIK3CA, andGATA3 were preferentially clonal in both sites, primary breast cancers and their synchronous metastases displayed spatial intratumor heterogeneity. Likely pathogenic mutations affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related genes, includingSMAD4, TCF7L2, andTCF4 (ITF2), were found to be restricted to or enriched in the metastatic lesions. Mutational signatures of trunk mutations differed from those of mutations enriched in the primary tumor or the metastasis in six cases.Conclusions: Synchronous primary breast cancers and metastases differ in their repertoire of somatic genetic alterations even in the absence of systemic therapy. Mutational signature shifts might contribute to spatial intratumor genetic heterogeneity.Clin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4402-15. ©2017 AACR.	4
Investigation of a genome wide association signal for obesity: synthetic association and haplotype analyses at the melanocortin 4 receptor gene locus. || 3' Flanking Region 5' Flanking Region Adolescent Child Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome-Wide Association Study Genotype Haplotypes Humans Logistic Models Male Mutation Obesity Open Reading Frames Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Risk Factors || Independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed an obesogenic effect of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; rs12970134 and rs17782313) more than 150 kb downstream of the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R). It is unclear if the SNPs directly influence MC4R function or expression, or if the SNPs are on a haplotype that predisposes to obesity or includes functionally relevant genetic variation (synthetic association). As both exist, functionally relevant mutations and polymorphisms in the MC4R coding region and a robust association downstream of the gene, MC4R is an ideal model to explore synthetic association. We analyzed a genomic region (364.9 kb) encompassing the MC4R in GWAS data of 424 obesity trios (extremely obese child/adolescent and both parents). SNP rs12970134 showed the lowest p-value (p = 0.004; relative risk for the obesity effect allele: 1.37); conditional analyses on this SNP revealed that 7 of 78 analyzed SNPs provided independent signals (p≤0.05). These 8 SNPs were used to derive two-marker haplotypes. The three best (according to p-value) haplotype combinations were chosen for confirmation in 363 independent obesity trios. The confirmed obesity effect haplotype includes SNPs 3' and 5' of the MC4R. Including MC4R coding variants in a joint model had almost no impact on the effect size estimators expected under synthetic association. A haplotype reaching from a region 5' of the MC4R to a region at least 150 kb from the 3' end of the gene showed a stronger association to obesity than single SNPs. Synthetic association analyses revealed that MC4R coding variants had almost no impact on the association signal. Carriers of the haplotype should be enriched for relevant mutations outside the MC4R coding region and could thus be used for re-sequencing approaches. Our data also underscore the problems underlying the identification of relevant mutations depicted by GWAS derived SNPs.	4
Compound heterozygosity in nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalanemia: the contribution of mutations for classical phenylketonuria. || Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors Europe Female Genetic Carrier Screening Haplotypes Humans Infant, Newborn Israel Male Mutation Pedigree Phenylalanine Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction || Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) results from defective hydroxylation of phenylalanine in the liver, in most cases because of defective phenylalanine hydroxylase. HPA is highly variable, ranging from moderate elevation of plasma phenylalanine with no clinical consequences to a severe disease, classical phenylketonuria (PKU). Non-PKU HPA was found in excess of PKU in Israel, while the opposite is true in Europe. To study the genetic basis of non-PKU HPA, we performed haplotype analysis at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in 27 families with non-PKU HPA. All individuals with this condition were compound heterozygotes. In six of these families, in which both PKU and non-PKU HPA were segregating, haplotype analysis showed that non-PKU HPA resulted from compound heterozygosity for a PKU mutation and a second mutation, with milder effect, which is probably expressed only when it interacts with the severe mutation. The involvement of PKU mutations in non-PKU HPA was further demonstrated in Jewish Yemenite families with non-PKU HPA, in which the individuals with this condition were carriers of the single PKU allele which exists in this community. In addition, two previously known PKU point mutations (R261Q and R408W) were found in individuals with non-PKU HPA. These mutations are associated, in our population, with the same haplotypes as those with which it is associated in Europe. Based on the above-mentioned genetic model for non-PKU HPA, successful prenatal diagnosis of this condition was performed in one family.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1 3
Functional characterization and classification of frequent low-density lipoprotein receptor variants. || Adult Animals CHO Cells Cricetulus Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Hypolipidemic Agents Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Protein Structure, Tertiary Receptors, LDL || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal-dominant disorder mostly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene leading to increased risk for premature cardiovascular diseases. According to functional studies, LDLR mutations may be classified into five classes. The main objective of this study was to characterize seven LDLR variants previously detected in FH patients. Analysis by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of LDLR activity demonstrate that all the studied variants are pathogenic. Among the mutations located in β-propeller, p.Trp577Gly and p.Ile624del were classified as class 2, whereas p.Arg416Trp and p.Thr454Asn as class 5. p.Phe800Glyfs*129 (located in the cytoplasmic domain), p.Cys155Tyr (located in the binding domain), and p.Asn825Lys (inside FxNPxY motif) were classified as class 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The results also show that LDLR activity of these class 4 and 5 variants is not completely abolished, showing a milder phenotype. We have also determined that statin response is more efficient lowering total cholesterol in heterozygous patients carrying p.Ile624del (class 2) compared with p.Arg416Trp and p.Thr454Asn (class 5) variants. In conclusion, these findings emphasize the importance of characterizing LDLR pathogenic variants to provide an indisputable FH diagnosis and to gain insight into the statin response depending on the LDLR class mutation.	4
High frequency of heterozygosity in GJB2 mutations among patients with non-syndromic hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Child Child, Preschool Codon, Nonsense Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Humans India Infant Male Middle Aged Polymerase Chain Reaction Young Adult || To determine the prevalence of GJB2 mutations among subjects with congenital, non-syndromic, sensorineural hearing loss, within a north Indian population. This was a case-control study in which the frequencies of the three most prevalent GJB2 mutations (35delG, W24X and 167delT) were studied. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism assays were performed to detect these mutations. The entire coding region of the GJB2 gene was sequenced in all patients, and also in any of their family members who showed GJB2 mutations. The 35delG mutation was found to be the most prevalent mutation (21 per cent), followed by the W24X mutation (7 per cent). This is the first report of the 35delG mutation in an Indian population. One patient was a compound heterozygote for 35delG/W24X. The 167delT mutation was not observed in any patient. These findings challenge the classical view that the W24X variant of the GJB2 gene represents a single 'founder' mutation.	4
The apoptotic and transcriptional transactivation activities of p53 can be dissociated. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Line, Transformed Culture Media, Serum-Free Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cyclins DNA Damage Fibroblasts Gamma Rays Humans Hydrolysis Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Knockout Mutation Peptide Hydrolases Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases RNA Polymerase II Transcriptional Activation Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ultraviolet Rays || Previous studies have shown that the apoptotic response of cells following DNA damage requires p53 expression. Wild-type p53 protein levels increase in response to DNA damage and its growth-suppressive action is thought to be mediated by transcriptional activation of the p21/WAF1/CIP1 gene, the product of which is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. The mechanism by which elevated p53 levels lead to apoptosis is not known, but is believed to involve transcriptional activation of apoptotic genes, such as BAX. We have studied transformed human cells that constitutively express high levels of the R273H mutant p53, which has been reported to lack transcriptional activation activity. We used the inability to induce the p21/Waf1/Cip1 protein as a marker to verify the lack of transcriptional activation activity. Cells expressing the R273H mutant of p53 do not show an increase in p21/Waf1/Cip1 following irradiation with ionizing or UVB radiation. Surprisingly, these cells are very susceptible to induction of apoptosis by UVB radiation, as seen by the formation of a nucleosomal ladder and the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This suggests that the R273 mutant p53 can function normally in apoptosis but not in transcriptional activation following DNA damage. Furthermore, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II is a potent inducer of apoptosis in these cells, demonstrating that transcription is not required for apoptosis and suggesting that stalled RNA polymerase II complexes can initiate apoptosis. Interestingly, proteolytic cleavage of p53 occurs during apoptosis in these cells, generating a 45-kDa fragment and liberating the DNA repair helicase binding domain of p53. We propose that the peptide liberated from the carboxy terminus of p53 may contribute to its apoptotic activity, possibly through interaction with the XPB and XPD DNA helicases.	0
Study of Ras/MAPK pathway gene variants in Chilean patients with Cryptorchidism. || Adolescent Child Child, Preschool Chile Cryptorchidism GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Variation Humans Infant MAP Kinase Kinase 2 Male Membrane Proteins Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf SOS1 Protein Signal Transduction ras Proteins || Cryptorchidism is one of the most common congenital disorders in boys, and several genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors have been proposed as possible causes for this genitourinary defect. Genetic factors have been intensively searched, but relatively few pathogenic variants have been described. Cryptorchidism is a frequent finding in patients with RASopathies, a group of syndrome caused by mutations in genes of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Our aim was to determine whether patients with isolated cryptorchidism (IC) exhibit Ras/MAPK pathway gene variants associated with RASopathies. Two hundred thirty-nine patients with IC were recruited after orchidopexy. Determination of Ras/MAPK pathway gene variants was performed by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis followed by sequencing. Restriction or allele-specific amplification assay was applied to (i) variant confirmation; (ii) search in healthy controls; and (iii) segregation analysis. Controls correspond to 100 healthy Chilean adults without a history of cryptorchidism. Molecular analysis showed one synonymous substitution (BRAF_p.Q456Q) in two patients and four missense substitutions (SOS1_ p.R497Q, BRAF_ p.F595L, NRAS_ p.T50I, and MAP2K2_ p.Y134C) in five patients. Our results suggest that some patients with isolated cryptorchidism, but with no evidence of dysmorphic features suggestive of RASopathies, may harbor Ras/MAPK pathway gene alterations.	4
Structural effects of the slow/b-cardiac myosin heavy chain R453C mutation in cardiac and skeletal muscle. || Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child DNA Mutational Analysis Death, Sudden, Cardiac Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel Fatal Outcome Female Humans Muscle, Skeletal Myocytes, Cardiac Myosin Heavy Chains || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents an important cause of sudden cardiac death particularly in otherwise healthy young individuals. In some families, HCM is caused by distinct mutations of the cardiac beta myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7). We have analyzed the expression of the malignant MYH7Arg453Cys mutation, in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and related it to morphological alterations. Morphological investigation revealed hypertrophic cardiomyocytes but regularly arranged myofibrils. Skeletal muscle showed no sign of structural alterations. Our results indicate that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is secondary, due to impaired function, and that the mutation causes no structural alteration in myofibrillar structure in cardiac or skeletal muscle.	4
[A case of bilateral coronal craniosynostosis with the P250R mutation in FGFR3 gene]. ||  || Recently, the substitution of proline 250 by arginine in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, has been identified in patients with craniosynostosis and defines a new syndrome on a molecular basis. We report a 1-year-1-month-old female with bilateral coronal craniosynostosis who had the P250R mutation in FGFR3 gene detected by DNA sequencing. She had brachycephaly, temporal bossing, high and flat forehead, hypertelorism, mild proptosis, low set ears and no digital abnormalities. She underwent surgical repair at 7 months and her cosmetic problems were improved. Her development was normal up to 13 months of age. DNA analysis from her parents showed that her father had the same mutation. The phenotypes of the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 syndrome are variable even within the same family, but main characteristic clinical features are follows, 1) lateral or bilateral coronal craniosynostosis, 2) mild hand and foot anomalies, and 3) sensory deafness. In FGFR3 syndrome the diagnosis of P250R mutation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is very easy and important for early diagnosis and genetic counseling.	4
Gene expression analyses of primary melanomas reveal CTHRC1 as an important player in melanoma progression. || Animals Apoptosis Biomarkers, Tumor Cell Adhesion Cell Movement Cell Proliferation Disease Progression Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female Fibronectins Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Integrin beta3 Melanocytes Melanoma Mice Mice, Inbred BALB C Mice, Nude NFATC Transcription Factors Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Skin Neoplasms Stromal Cells Tumor Cells, Cultured Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || Melanoma is notorious for its high tendency to metastasize and its refractoriness to conventional treatments after metastasis, and the responses to most targeted therapies are short-lived. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind melanoma development and progression is needed to develop more effective therapies and to identify new markers to predict disease behavior. Here, we compared the gene expression profiles of benign nevi, and non-metastatic and metastatic primary melanomas to identify any common changes in disease progression. We identified several genes associated with inflammation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix modification to be upregulated in metastatic melanomas. We selected one of these genes, collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1), for detailed analysis, and found that CTHRC1 was expressed in both melanoma cells and the associated fibroblasts, as well as in the endothelium of tumor blood vessels. Knockdown of CTHRC1 expression by shRNAs in melanoma cells inhibited their migration in Transwell assays and their invasion in three-dimensional collagen and Matrigel matrices. We also elucidated the possible down-stream effectors of CTHRC1 by gene expression profiling of the CTHRC1-knockdown cells. Our analyses showed that CTHRC1 is regulated coordinately with fibronectin and integrin β3 by the pro-invasive and -angiogenic transcription factor NFATC2. We also found CTHRC1 to be a target of TFGβ and BRAF. These data highlight the importance of tumor stroma in melanoma progression. Furthermore, CTHRC1 was recognized as an important mediator of melanoma cell migration and invasion, providing together with its regulators-NFATC2, TGFβ, and BRAF-attractive therapeutic targets against metastatic melanomas.	0
Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in Merkel cell carcinoma. || Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming Base Sequence Carcinoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Merkel Cell Cell Line, Tumor Chromones DNA Mutational Analysis Enzyme Activation Humans Molecular Sequence Data Morpholines Mutation Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Phosphorylation Phosphothreonine Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt Signal Transduction Skin Neoplasms || Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive skin cancer with an increasing incidence. The understanding of the molecular carcinogenesis of MCC is limited. Here, we scrutinized the PI3K/AKT pathway, one of the major pathways activated in human cancer, in MCC. Immunohistochemical analysis of 41 tumor tissues and 9 MCC cell lines revealed high levels of AKT phosphorylation at threonine 308 in 88% of samples. Notably, the AKT phosphorylation was not correlated with the presence or absence of the Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCV). Accordingly, knock-down of the large and small T antigen by shRNA in MCV positive MCC cells did not affect phosphorylation of AKT. We also analyzed 46 MCC samples for activating PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations. Oncogenic PIK3CA mutations were found in 2/46 (4%) MCCs whereas mutations in exon 4 of AKT1 were absent. MCC cell lines demonstrated a high sensitivity towards the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002. This finding together with our observation that the PI3K/AKT pathway is activated in the majority of human MCCs identifies PI3K/AKT as a potential new therapeutic target for MCC patients.	0
Non-homologous recombination between Alu and LINE-1 repeats results in a 91 kb deletion in MERTK causing severe retinitis pigmentosa. || Alu Elements Child Child, Preschool Exons Female Gene Deletion Humans Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements Male Mutation, Missense Pedigree Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Recombination, Genetic Retinitis Pigmentosa Siblings Whole Genome Sequencing c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase || Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) represents a large group of inherited retinal diseases characterized by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Among patients with RP in northern Sweden, we identified two severely affected siblings and aimed to reveal a genetic cause underlying their disease. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on both affected individuals. Sequence variants were filtered using a custom pipeline to find a rare or novel variant predicted to affect protein function. Genome-wide genotyping was used to identify copy number variants (CNVs) and homozygous regions with potential disease causative genes. WES uncovered a novel heterozygous variant in the MER proto-oncogene, tyrosine kinase (MERTK) gene, c.2309A>G, p.Glu770Gly located in the tyrosine kinase domain and predicted to be likely pathogenic. The second variant, a large heterozygous deletion encompassing exons 1 to 7 of theMERTK gene, was revealed with genome-wide genotyping. The CNV analysis suggested breakpoints of the deletion, in the 5'-untranslated region and in intron 7. We identified genomic sequences at the site of the deletion as part of L1ME4b (LINE/L1) and AluSx3 that indicated a non-homologous recombination as a mechanism of the deletion evolvement. Patients with RP in this study were carriers of two novel allelic mutations in the MERTK gene, a missense variant in exon 17 and an approximate 91 kb genomic deletion. Mapping of the deletion breakpoints allowed molecular testing of a cohort of patients with RP with allele-specific PCR. These findings provide additional information about mutations inMERTK for molecular testing of unsolved recessive RP cases and highlight the necessity for analysis of large genomic deletions.	4
Prevalence of the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene in two samples of non-syndromic deaf subjects from Chile. || Adolescent Adult Base Sequence Child Child, Preschool Chile Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Severity of Illness Index Young Adult || Hearing loss is the most common inherited sensorial deficiency in humans; about 1 in 1000 children suffer from severe or profound hearing loss at birth. Mutations in the GJB2 gene are the most common cause of prelingual, non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness in many populations; the c.35delG mutation is the most common in Caucasian populations. The frequency of the c.35delG mutation was estimated in two samples of deaf patients from Santiago, Chile. Unrelated non-syndromic sensorioneural deaf patients were examined: Group 1 consisted of 47 unrelated individuals with neurosensory deafness referred to the Chilean Cochlear Implant Program; Group 2 included 66 school children with prelingual deafness attending special education institutions for deaf people. Individuals with profound to moderate isolated neurosensory hearing loss with unknown etiology were included. The presence of the c.35delG mutation was evaluated by the allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method (PCR), and in some cases it was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing of the coding region of the GJB2 gene. Deaf relatives were present in 20.3% of the cases. We found 19.5% (22/113) patients with the c.35delG mutation, 6 of them homozygous; these rates are similar to frequencies found in other Latin American countries.	4
Single-molecule analysis of transcription factor binding at transcription sites in live cells. || Binding Sites Chromatin Humans Protein Structure, Tertiary Receptors, Glucocorticoid Recombinant Fusion Proteins Response Elements Transcription Factors Transcription Initiation Site Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Although numerous live-cell measurements have shown that transcription factors (TFs) bind chromatin transiently, no measurements of transient binding have been reported at the endogenous response elements (REs) where transcription is normally induced. Here we show that at endogenous REs the transcriptionally productive specific binding of two TFs, p53 and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), is transient. We also find that the transient residence times of GR at endogenous REs are roughly comparable to those at an artificial, multi-copy array of gene regulatory sites, supporting the use of multi-copy arrays for live-cell analysis of transcription. Finally, we find that at any moment only a small fraction of TF molecules are engaged in transcriptionally productive binding at endogenous REs. The small fraction of bound factors provides one explanation for gene bursting and it also indicates that REs may often be unoccupied, resulting in partial responses to transcriptional signals.	0
Next-generation sequencing for molecular diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma specimens obtained by fine needle aspiration cytology. || Adenocarcinoma Biopsy, Fine-Needle Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Lung Neoplasms Male Mutation Neoplasm Proteins || Identification of multi-gene variations has led to the development of new targeted therapies in lung adenocarcinoma patients, and identification of an appropriate patient population with a reliable screening method is the key to the overall success of tumor targeted therapies. In this study, we used the Ion Torrent next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique to screen for mutations in 89 cases of lung adenocarcinoma metastatic lymph node specimens obtained by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Of the 89 specimens, 30 (34%) were found to harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain mutations. Seven (8%) samples harbored KRAS mutations, and three (3%) samples had BRAF mutations involving exon 11 (G469A) and exon 15 (V600E). Eight (9%) samples harbored PIK3CA mutations. One (1%) sample had a HRAS G12C mutation. Thirty-two (36%) samples (36%) harbored TP53 mutations. Other genes including APC, ATM, MET, PTPN11, GNAS, HRAS, RB1, SMAD4 and STK11 were found each in one case. Our study has demonstrated that NGS using the Ion Torrent technology is a useful tool for gene mutation screening in lung adenocarcinoma metastatic lymph node specimens obtained by FNAC, and may promote the development of new targeted therapies in lung adenocarcinoma patients.	4
Whole-exome sequencing as a powerful tool for identifying genetic causes in a patient with POLG-related disorders and phenylketonuria. ||  || This study's aim was to identify the genetic causes in a patient with phenylketonuria and hearing loss, liver disease, developmental and mental retardation, hypotonia, and external ophthalmoplegia. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing analysis were used to determine the genetic causes of manifestations in a young boy with hearing loss, liver disease, develop-mental and mental retardation, hypotonia, and external ophthalmoplegia. We found that the child harbored polymerase gamma ( POLG) compound heterozygous mutations, c.2617G>A (p.E873K) and c.3550G>A (p.D1184N), and phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH) compound heterozygous mutations, c.721C>T (p.R241C) and c.728G>A (p.R243Q). Among them, the POLG p.E873K mutation is a novel mutation and is not present in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database, Genome Aggregation database, and 1000 Genomes database. The two heterozygous mutations were each inherited from both of the child's parents. This finding suggested that the phenotype and the genotype were segregated. Using whole-exome sequencing, we not only identified PAH mutations causing phenylketonuria, but also identified the genetic cause of the mitochondrial disease and found a novel POLG mutation. Our findings could be useful in helping future parents obtain healthy embryos through assisted reproductive technology.	3
Pre-operative role of BRAF in the guidance of the surgical approach and prognosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. ||  || The p.V600E BRAF and RAS mutations are found in 30-80% of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). BRAF mutation has been associated with poor prognosis. This study investigated the role of molecular studies in preoperative diagnosis of DTC and the association of p.V600E mutation with prognostic factors. Prospective study. A total of 202 patients with cytological diagnosis of Bethesda III-VI underwent preoperative molecular studies and subsequent thyroidectomy. p.V600E and RAS mutations were studied in the cytology smears, using real-time PCR genotyping technique. The BRAF mutation (BRAF(+) or BRAF(-)) was correlated with histological and clinical findings. Molecular study of 172 nodules with Bethesda III-V cytology improved negative predictive value and accuracy of Bethesda III and IV diagnosis. BRAF mutation was present in 65% of 94 DTC and p.Q61R NRAS in one. Except for age, BRAF(+) and BRAF(-) did not differ in sex, tumor size, histological subtype, multifocality, vascular invasion, extrathyroidal extension, or prognostic staging. Among papillary carcinomas, lymph node (LN) metastasis was diagnosed in 23% BRAF(+) and 37% BRAF(-). Distant metastasis occurred in four BRAF(-). Recurrent or persistent disease was more frequent in BRAF(-) (26.7 vs 3.3% BRAF(+), P=0.002) along follow-up of 29.8±10 months. BRAF(+) patients without LN metastasis by pre-operative evaluation submitted to thyroidectomy with central neck dissection (CND) had more frequent LN metastasis (45 vs 5% no CND, P=0.002), but no difference in clinical outcome was observed. Pre-operative identification of BRAF mutation improved cytological diagnosis of DTC, but it was not associated with poor prognostic factors. Prophylactic CND did not guarantee better outcome in BRAF(+) patients.	4
Germinal mosaicism in Noonan syndrome: A family with two affected siblings of normal parents. || Adult Child, Preschool Female Haplotypes Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Middle Aged Mosaicism Noonan Syndrome Parents Pedigree Pregnancy Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Siblings || Noonan syndrome (NS; OMIM 163950) is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable clinical expression and genetic heterogeneity. Clinical manifestations include characteristic facial features, short stature, and cardiac anomalies. Mutations in protein-tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor-type 11 (PTPN11), encoding SHP-2, account for about half of NS patients. We report on a Moroccan family with two children with NS and apparently unaffected parents. The molecular studies showed the heterozygous mutation c.922A>G of PTPN11 gene in the two affected sibs. Neither the parents, nor the oldest brother carries this mutation in hematologic cells. The mutation was also absent in buccal epithelial cells and fingernails of both parents. We believe this is the first report of germ cell mosaicism in NS and suggest an empirical risk for recurrence of that is less than 1%.	4
Costello syndrome with severe cutis laxa and mosaic HRAS G12S mutation. || Amino Acid Sequence Amino Acid Substitution Base Sequence Costello Syndrome Cutis Laxa DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Molecular Sequence Data Mosaicism Mutation Pregnancy Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Costello syndrome is a rare developmental disorder characterized by coarse face, postnatal growth retardation, skin and musculoskeletal anomalies, cardiovascular abnormalities, mental retardation, and tumor predisposition. Dermatological manifestations usually include redundant, soft and thickened skin. Loose skin is especially present over the neck, hands, and feet. Heterozygous missense mutations in HRAS are causative for Costello syndrome, with the c.34G > A (p.G12S) mutation as the most commonly found alteration. In the majority of affected individuals pathogenic sequence changes appeared de novo, however, two individuals with somatic mosaicism for the HRAS mutation have been reported. Here, we describe a boy with somatic mosaicism for the c.34G > A mutation in HRAS. Allelic quantitation revealed the mutation in approximately 58% of his lymphocytes; however, in DNA derived from buccal cells we could not detect the sequence change. The patient presented with the typical clinical findings of Costello syndrome such as increased birth weight, severe failure to thrive, characteristic facial appearance, and skin abnormalities. The dermatological anomalies were remarkable as he showed severe skin laxity with wrinkling of skin on all parts of the body due to loss of subcutaneous fat that decreased significantly by age 13 months. This case further adds to the phenotypic variability seen in patients with somatic mosaicism for an HRAS mutation and highlights the awareness of mosaic mutations in Costello syndrome when molecular testing is performed.	4
Connexin gene mutations among Ugandan patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Mutation Prevalence Uganda Young Adult || Congenital deafness occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 live births, and 50% of these cases are hereditary. Connexin mutations have been identified as the most common cause of hereditary hearing loss in many populations. The prevalence of this mutation in African patients has not been adequately studied. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of connexin 26 and 30 mutations in a population of hearing-impaired patients from Uganda. This is an observational study. Coding regions of both GJB2 and GJB6, noncoding exon 1 of GJB2, and 30 nucleotides of intronic sequence bordering the exons were analyzed in 126 subjects from Uganda with confirmed bilateral, severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss. All variants were analyzed for possible clinical significance using a combination of database searches and in silico tools. Complete sequence data were obtained on 115/126 individuals; 11 had only partial or no results. Only one reported pathogenic variant was found in GJB2 (c.208C>G; p.Pro70Ala) and none in GJB6. Three reported variants and two novel variants within intron 1 of GJB2 and two variants within exon 3 of GJB6 were also found. None of the most common types of deletions in the GJB2 gene (c.35delG, c.167delT or c.235delC) were found in this large cohort of deaf children from Uganda. This prompts a search for genetic causes of deafness among this and other previously studied African populations.	4
Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patient with TP53 tumor mutation experienced 11 months progression-free survival on bortezomib monotherapy without adverse events after ending standard treatments with grade 3 adverse events. || Alcohol Oxidoreductases Bortezomib Breast Neoplasms Disease-Free Survival Exome Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Glutathione S-Transferase pi Humans Middle Aged Mutation Phylogeny Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Whole Exome Sequencing || A triple-negative breast cancer patient had no hereditary BRCA1,BRCA2, orTP53 risk variants. After exhaustion of standard treatments, she underwent experimental treatments and whole-exome sequencing of tumor, blood, and a metastasis. Well-tolerated experimental bortezomib monotherapy was administered for a progression-free period of 11 mo. After progression, treatments were changed and the exome data were evaluated, expanded with RNA and exome sequencing of a late-stage metastasis. In the final stage, eribulin alone and in combination with anthracyclines were administered. While suffering from grade 3 adverse events, skin metastases progressed. She lived 51 mo after initial diagnosis.Toxicity from anthracyclines and cisplatin may have been due to associated germline variantsCBR3 C4Y and V224M andGSTP1 I105V, respectively. Somatic mutations predicted or reported as pathogenic were detected in 38 genes in tumor tissues. All tumor samples harbored the heterozygousTP53 Y220C variant, known to destabilize p53 and down-regulate p53-mediated apoptosis. The success of bortezomib may be explained by the previously reported up-regulation of caspase-mediated apoptosis, which is p53-independent. Phylogenetic analysis of blood, primary tumor, and two metastases inferred an ancestral tumor cell with 12 expressed tumor mutations from which all three tumors may have evolved.Although our first urgent analysis could only include 40 genes, postmortem analysis uncovered the aggressiveness and suggested experimental therapies including 16 actionable targets, partly validated by immunohistochemistry. Exome and transcriptome analyses yielded comprehensive therapy-relevant information and should be considered for patients at first diagnosis.	4
Differential regulation of the REGγ-proteasome pathway by p53/TGF-β signalling and mutant p53 in cancer cells. || Animals Autoantigens Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor E1A-Associated p300 Protein Escherichia coli Feedback, Physiological Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Mice Mutation Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1 Promoter Regions, Genetic Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Proteolysis Recombinant Fusion Proteins Signal Transduction Smad3 Protein Transforming Growth Factor beta Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Proteasome activity is frequently enhanced in cancer to accelerate metastasis and tumorigenesis. REGγ, a proteasome activator known to promote p53/p21/p16 degradation, is often overexpressed in cancer cells. Here we show that p53/TGF-β signalling inhibits the REGγ-20S proteasome pathway by repressing REGγ expression. Smad3 and p53 interact on the REGγ promoter via the p53RE/SBE region. Conversely, mutant p53 binds to the REGγ promoter and recruits p300. Importantly, mutant p53 prevents Smad3/N-CoR complex formation on the REGγ promoter, which enhances the activity of the REGγ-20S proteasome pathway and contributes to mutant p53 gain of function. Depletion of REGγ alters the cellular response to p53/TGF-β signalling in drug resistance, proliferation, cell cycle progression and proteasome activity. Moreover, p53 mutations show a positive correlation with REGγ expression in cancer samples. These findings suggest that targeting REGγ-20S proteasome for cancer therapy may be applicable to human tumours with abnormal p53/Smad protein status. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a link between p53/TGF-β signalling and the REGγ-20S proteasome pathway, and provides insight into the REGγ/p53 feedback loop.	0
Tumor-derived p53 mutants induce NF-kappaB2 gene expression. || Adenoviridae Bromodeoxyuridine Cell Line, Tumor Cell Nucleus Cloning, Molecular DNA, Complementary Disease Progression Etoposide Exons Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genetic Vectors Humans Mutation NF-kappa B NF-kappa B p52 Subunit Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Polymerase Chain Reaction RNA RNA, Small Interfering Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || Overexpression of mutant p53 is a common theme in tumors, suggesting a selective pressure for p53 mutation in cancer development and progression. To determine how mutant p53 expression may lead to survival advantage in human cancer cells, we generated stable cell lines expressing p53 mutants p53-R175H, -R273H, and -D281G by use of p53-null human H1299 (lung carcinoma) cells. Compared to vector-transfected cells, H1299 cells expressing mutant p53 showed a survival advantage when treated with etoposide, a common chemotherapeutic agent; however, cells expressing the transactivation-deficient triple mutant p53-D281G (L22Q/W23S) had significantly lower resistance to etoposide. Gene expression profiling of cells expressing transcriptionally active mutant p53 proteins revealed the striking pattern that all three p53 mutants induced expression of approximately 100 genes involved in cell growth, survival, and adhesion. The gene NF-kappaB2 is a prominent member of this group, whose overexpression in H1299 cells also leads to chemoresistance. Treatment of H1299 cells expressing p53-R175H with small interfering RNA specific for NF-kappaB2 made these cells more sensitive to etoposide. We have also observed activation of the NF-kappaB2 pathway in mutant p53-expressing cells. Thus, one possible pathway through which mutants of p53 may induce loss of drug sensitivity is via the NF-kappaB2 pathway.	0
BRCA1-mutated and basal-like breast cancers have similar aCGH profiles and a high incidence of protein truncating TP53 mutations. || Adult BRCA1 Protein Breast Neoplasms Cluster Analysis Comparative Genomic Hybridization DNA Mutational Analysis Databases, Genetic Female Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genomic Instability Genotype Humans Middle Aged Mutation Netherlands Phenotype Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Basal-like breast cancers (BLBC) are aggressive breast cancers for which, so far, no targeted therapy is available because they typically lack expression of hormone receptors and HER2. Phenotypic features of BLBCs, such as clinical presentation and early age of onset, resemble those of breast tumors from BRCA1-mutation carriers. The genomic instability of BRCA1-mutated tumors can be effectively targeted with DNA-damaging agents and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors. Molecular similarities between BLBCs and BRCA1-mutated tumors may therefore provide predictive markers for therapeutic response of BLBCs. There are several known molecular features characteristic for BRCA1-mutated breast tumors: 1) increased numbers of genomic aberrations, 2) a distinct pattern of genomic aberrations, 3) a high frequency of TP53 mutations and 4) a high incidence of complex, protein-truncating TP53 mutations. We compared the frequency of TP53 mutations and the pattern and amount of genomic aberrations between BRCA1-mutated breast tumors, BLBCs and luminal breast tumors by TP53 gene sequencing and array-based comparative genomics hybridization (aCGH) analysis. We found that the high incidence of protein truncating TP53 mutations and the pattern and amount of genomic aberrations specific for BRCA1-mutated breast tumors are also characteristic for BLBCs and different from luminal breast tumors. Complex, protein truncating TP53 mutations in BRCA1-mutated tumors may be a direct consequence of genomic instability caused by BRCA1 loss, therefore, the presence of these types of TP53 mutations in sporadic BLBCs might be a hallmark of BRCAness and a potential biomarker for sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Also, our data suggest that a small subset of genomic regions may be used to identify BRCA1-like BLBCs. BLBCs share molecular features that were previously found to be specific for BRCA1-mutated breast tumors. These features might be useful for the identification of tumors with increased sensitivity to (high-dose or dose-dense) alkylating agents and PARP inhibitors.	4
GJB2 and GJB6 gene mutations found in Indian probands with congenital hearing impairment. || Adult Case-Control Studies Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins Consanguinity Female Gene Frequency Hearing Loss Humans India Male Mutation Prevalence Young Adult || Genetically caused deafness is a common trait affecting one in 1000 children and is predominantly inherited in an autosomalrecessive fashion. Several mutations in the GJB2 gene and a deletion of 342 kb in GJB6 gene (delGJB6-D13S1830) have been identified worldwide in patients with hearing impairment. In the present study, 303 nonsyndromic hearing-impaired patients (140 familial; 163 sporadic) were examined clinically and screened for mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 genes. Mutations in GJB2 gene were found in 33 (10.9%) patients of whom six (18.2%) were carriers for the mutant allele. The most frequent mutation was p.W24X accounting for 87% of the mutant alleles. In addition, six other sequence variations were identified in the GJB2 gene viz., c.IVS1+1G>A, c.167delT, c.235delC, p.W77X, p.R127H (polymorphism), p.M163V. None of the samples showed del(GJB6-D13S1830) or any point mutations in GJB6 gene.	4
Structure-based predictions broadly link transcription factor mutations to gene expression changes in cancers. || Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit DNA Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Humans Models, Molecular Mutation Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Protein Structure, Tertiary Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Thousands of unique mutations in transcription factors (TFs) arise in cancers, and the functional and biological roles of relatively few of these have been characterized. Here, we used structure-based methods developed specifically for DNA-binding proteins to systematically predict the consequences of mutations in several TFs that are frequently mutated in cancers. The explicit consideration of protein-DNA interactions was crucial to explain the roles and prevalence of mutations in TP53 and RUNX1 in cancers, and resulted in a higher specificity of detection for known p53-regulated genes among genetic associations between TP53 genotypes and genome-wide expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas, compared to existing methods of mutation assessment. Biophysical predictions also indicated that the relative prevalence of TP53 missense mutations in cancer is proportional to their thermodynamic impacts on protein stability and DNA binding, which is consistent with the selection for the loss of p53 transcriptional function in cancers. Structure and thermodynamics-based predictions of the impacts of missense mutations that focus on specific molecular functions may be increasingly useful for the precise and large-scale inference of aberrant molecular phenotypes in cancer and other complex diseases.	0
[PCR-GeneScan technique for detection of the GJB2 235 delC and mtDNA A1555G mutations for hereditary hearing loss]. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Mitochondrial Genetic Testing Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction || To develop a molecular genetic assay to detect the GJB2 235 delC and mtDNA A1555G mutations simultaneously based on fluorescent labeled multiplex PCR and automatic DNA fragment analyzing techniques. One hundred and twenty samples were pooled in our experiment to test the feasibility of new method. The PCRs were performed and the size fragment of PCR products were analyzed on ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Data analysis were taken using the software package of GeneScan and GeneMarker. Seventeen samples of DNA with 235 delC and 17 samples with A1555G were tested using this protocol. A false-positive sample without GJB2 235 delC mutation was tested. This assay can detect both mutations in pooled DNA tests and will be a useful tool for newborn screening and carrier screening for the hereditary hearing loss in Chinese population.	4
[Features of nationwide distribution and frequency of a common gap junction beta-2 gene mutation in China]. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexins Female Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Male Point Mutation Prevalence Young Adult || To determine the prevalence of a common GJB2 mutation in a big Chinese population of deaf children and the features of its distribution in regions all over the nation and to provide epidemiology data and expertise for genetic testing of deafness in China. The DNA samples of NSHI patients and normal controls were collected from different typical areas of China. The method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) with ApaI was used to determine the genotype of GJB2 235 site. Totally 16.3% of patients carried at least one 235 delC mutant allele. Among them, 7.8% was homozygous and 8.5% was heterozygous. The prevalence of GJB2 235delC mutation in China was evident, and the significant difference of 235delC mutation frequency was found in sub-population from different areas and different ethnic groups. Based upon the result of this screening as stated, Chinese NSHI patients appear to have 235delC frequency and the number of GJB2 related deafness was estimated to be huge. The testing of GJB2 235delC mutation would play an important role in genetic diagnosis and screening in China. As high as 15% of patients could be diagnosed as GJB2 caused deafness (bi-allelic mutation) only by means of this simple, fast and economic assay. In addition, patients were negative for 235delC mutation would be candidates for further mutational analysis of GJB2 or other deafness related genes.	4
IDH-mutated astrocytomas with 19q-loss constitute a subgroup that confers better prognosis. || Adult Aged Astrocytoma Brain Neoplasms Chromosome Deletion Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1 Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19 Female Humans Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis || IDH-mutant gliomas are classified into astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumors by 1p/19q status in the WHO 2016 classification, with the latter presenting with characteristic morphology and better prognosis in general. However, the morphological and genetic features within each category are varied, and there might be distinguishable subtypes. We analyzed 170 WHO grade II-IV gliomas resected in our institution. 1p/19q status was analyzed by microsatellite analysis, and genetic mutations were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. For validation, the Brain Lower Grade Glioma dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas was analyzed. Of the 42 grade III IDH-mutated gliomas, 12 were 1p-intact/19q-intact (anaplastic astrocytomas [AA]), 7 were 1p-intact/19q-loss (AA), and 23 showed 1p/19q-codeletion (anaplastic oligodendrogliomas). Of the 88 IDH-wild type glioblastomas (GBMs), 14 showed 1p-intact/19q-loss status. All of the seven 1p-intact/19q-loss AAs harbored TP53 mutation, but no TERT promotor mutation. All 19q-loss AAs had regions presenting oligodendroglioma-like morphology, and were associated with significantly longer overall survival compared to 19q-intact AAs (P = .001). This tendency was observed in The Cancer Genome Atlas Lower Grade Glioma dataset. In contrast, there was no difference in overall survival between the 19q-loss GBM and 19q-intact GBM (P = .4). In a case of 19q-loss AA, both oligodendroglial morphology and 19q-loss disappeared after recurrence, possibly indicating correlation between 19q-loss and oligodendroglial morphology. We showed that there was a subgroup, although small, of IDH-mutated astrocytomas harboring 19q-loss that present oligodendroglial morphology, and also were associated with significantly better prognosis compared to other 19q-intact astrocytomas.	4
Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene mutations and diabetes in Norway. || Adolescent Adult Child DNA DNA-Binding Proteins Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Family Health Female Founder Effect Genetic Testing Genetic Variation Haplotypes Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta Humans Male Middle Aged Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Norway Nuclear Proteins Pedigree Point Mutation Protein Binding Transcription Factors || Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), type 3. To estimate the prevalence of MODY3 in Norwegian diabetic pedigrees, we screened a total of 130 families for HNF-1 alpha mutations; 42 families with clinical MODY, 75 with suspected MODY, and 13 pedigrees with multiplex type 1 diabetes. Twenty-two families with clinical MODY, 15 families with suspected MODY, and one family with type 1 diabetes multiplex harbored HNF-1 alpha mutations. Thus, in about half of Norwegian families with clinical MODY, mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene could be detected. Eight of the 18 different mutations identified were novel (G47E, T196fsdelCCAA, IVS3-1G>A, S256T, A276D, S445fsdelAG, M522V, and S531T). Haplotypes were determined for recurrent mutations, indicating a founder effect in Norway for the hot-spot mutation P291fsinsC and possibly also for P112L and R131W. To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying MODY3, we investigated the functional properties of 13 HNF-1 alpha mutations. Two mutant HNF-1 alpha proteins (R171X, R263C) were unable to bind DNA and at least five mutants (R131W, R171X, P379fsdelCT, S445fsdelAG, and Q466X) showed defective nuclear translocation. Transcriptional activation was reduced for most of the MODY3-associated mutants. Accordingly, the functional studies of HNF-1 alpha mutants indicate that beta-cell dysfunction in MODY3 is caused by loss-of-function mechanisms like reduced DNA binding, impaired transcriptional activation, and defects in subcellular localization.	4
Splice-shifting oligonucleotide (SSO) mediated blocking of an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) created by the prevalent c.903+469T>C MTRR mutation corrects splicing and restores enzyme activity in patient cells. || Anemia, Megaloblastic Cell Line Cells, Cultured Exons Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase HEK293 Cells Homocystinuria Humans Mutation Oligonucleotides RNA Splice Sites RNA Splicing Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid || The prevalent c.903+469T>C mutation in MTRR causes the cblE type of homocystinuria by strengthening an SRSF1 binding site in an ESE leading to activation of a pseudoexon. We hypothesized that other splicing regulatory elements (SREs) are also critical for MTRR pseudoexon inclusion. We demonstrate that the MTRR pseudoexon is on the verge of being recognized and is therefore vulnerable to several point mutations that disrupt a fine-tuned balance between the different SREs. Normally, pseudoexon inclusion is suppressed by a hnRNP A1 binding exonic splicing silencer (ESS). When the c.903+469T>C mutation is present two ESEs abrogate the activity of the ESS and promote pseudoexon inclusion. Blocking the 3'splice site or the ESEs by SSOs is effective in restoring normal splicing of minigenes and endogenous MTRR transcripts in patient cells. By employing an SSO complementary to both ESEs, we were able to rescue MTRR enzymatic activity in patient cells to approximately 50% of that in controls. We show that several point mutations, individually, can activate a pseudoexon, illustrating that this mechanism can occur more frequently than previously expected. Moreover, we demonstrate that SSO blocking of critical ESEs is a promising strategy to treat the increasing number of activated pseudoexons.	0
Age of obesity onset in MC4R mutation carriers. || MC4R mutation carriers adolescents. children obesity || The mutations in gene for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) are the most common etiology factors of monogenic obesity development. Recently, it has been shown that current life style has a significant impact on the phenotype of MC4R mutation carriers - increases the penetrance of the mutations. We aimed to study the impact of the current age on the time of obesity onset among MC4R mutation carriers. DNA analysis of the MC4R gene was performed in 268 unrelated Slovak and Moravian obese children and adolescents 18 years and 28 blood relatives >18 years of the probands with a mutation. Three different previously described heterozygous loss of function MC4R mutations (p.Ser19Alafs*34, p.Ser127Leu, and p.Gly181Asp) were found in 3 <18 years probands, 3 adult probands, and 6 adult obese/overweight family relatives. The age of obesity onset in mutation carriers was 1 year in all probands in the children group and 1-35 years (median 11 years) in adults. The age of the obesity onset significantly correlated (R=0.809, p=0.028) with the current age in all of the MC4R mutation carriers. The age of obesity onset in the present child generation of MC4R mutation carriers is decreasing compared to the age of onset in their parents' generation. This is in agreement with similarly increasing penetrance of obesity in MC4R mutation carriers and it points out to escalation of obesogenic potential of environment.	4
Connexin 26 and connexin 30 mutations in children with nonsyndromic hearing loss. || Adolescent Audiometry, Pure-Tone Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Female Gene Deletion Gene Expression Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Mass Screening Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Severity of Illness Index || Mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx26) or gap junction beta 2 gene are the leading cause of hereditary nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss in Caucasians. The Cx26 coding region of 68 children with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss was sequenced to determine the frequency and type of Cx26 mutations in this population. Screening was also performed for a common connexin 30 (Cx30) or gap junction beta 6 mutation (del [GJB6-D13S1830]). Children also underwent audiological testing to determine whether any correlation exists between Cx26 mutations and severity of hearing loss. In all, 68 children with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss were screened for Cx26 and Cx30 mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers that flank the entire Cx26 coding region. Screening for the 342-kb Cx30 deletion was performed using primers that amplified the breakpoint junction of the deletion. The amplicons were then sequenced in both directions and analyzed for mutations. Audiometric testing, including pure-tone audiometry and auditory evoked brainstem response, was also performed to determine the degree of hearing loss. Twenty-seven of 68 children tested had mutations in Cx26 with 35delG being the most prevalent. Ten additional Cx26 mutations were detected including a novel compound heterozygote. Two children were heterozygous for the Cx30 del (GJB6-D13S1830) mutation. Cx26 and Cx30 mutations were present in 41.2% of children tested in the study population. Audiometric data supported previous studies demonstrating a greater degree of hearing loss in subjects who are homozygous for the 35delG mutation.	4
Genomic Classification of Cutaneous Melanoma. || Databases, Genetic Humans Melanoma Mutation National Cancer Institute (U.S.) Skin Neoplasms United States || We describe the landscape of genomic alterations in cutaneous melanomas through DNA, RNA, and protein-based analysis of 333 primary and/or metastatic melanomas from 331 patients. We establish a framework for genomic classification into one of four subtypes based on the pattern of the most prevalent significantly mutated genes: mutant BRAF, mutant RAS, mutant NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type). Integrative analysis reveals enrichment of KIT mutations and focal amplifications and complex structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We found no significant outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned a transcriptomic subclass enriched for immune gene expression associated with lymphocyte infiltrate on pathology review and high LCK protein expression, a T cell marker, were associated with improved patient survival. This clinicopathological and multi-dimensional analysis suggests that the prognosis of melanoma patients with regional metastases is influenced by tumor stroma immunobiology, offering insights to further personalize therapeutic decision-making.	0
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: how do mutations lead to disease? || Animals Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Disease Models, Animal Gene Expression Genotype Humans Mutation Phenotype Sarcomeres || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common monogenic genetic cardiac disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1:500 in the general population. Clinically, HCM is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricle (LV) walls, especially the septum, usually asymmetric, in the absence of any cardiac or systemic disease that leads to a secondary hypertrophy. The clinical course of the disease has a large inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity, ranging from mild symptoms of heart failure late in life to the onset of sudden cardiac death at a young age and is caused by a mutation in one of the genes that encode a protein from the sarcomere, Z-disc or intracellular calcium modulators. Although many genes and mutations are already known to cause HCM, the molecular pathways that lead to the phenotype are still unclear. This review focus on the molecular mechanisms of HCM, the pathways from mutation to clinical phenotype and how the disease's genotype correlates with phenotype.	4
Tumor-Specific Mitochondrial DNA Variants Are Rarely Detected in Cell-Free DNA. || Aged Aged, 80 and over Alleles Biomarkers, Tumor Circulating Tumor DNA Computational Biology DNA, Mitochondrial DNA, Neoplasm Female Gene Frequency Genetic Heterogeneity Genetic Variation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Neoplasms Phylogeny || The use of blood-circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a "liquid biopsy" in oncology is being explored for its potential as a cancer biomarker. Mitochondria contain their own circular genomic entity (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA), up to even thousands of copies per cell. The mutation rate of mtDNA is several orders of magnitude higher than that of the nuclear DNA. Tumor-specific variants have been identified in tumors along the entire mtDNA, and their number varies among and within tumors. The high mtDNA copy number per cell and the high mtDNA mutation rate make it worthwhile to explore the potential of tumor-specific cf-mtDNA variants as cancer marker in the blood of cancer patients. We used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to profile the entire mtDNA of 19 tissue specimens (primary tumor and/or metastatic sites, and tumor-adjacent normal tissue) and 9 cfDNA samples, originating from 8 cancer patients (5 breast, 3 colon). For each patient, tumor-specific mtDNA variants were detected and traced in cfDNA by SMRT sequencing and/or digital PCR to explore their feasibility as cancer biomarker. As a reference, we measured other blood-circulating biomarkers for these patients, including driver mutations in nuclear-encoded cfDNA and cancer-antigen levels or circulating tumor cells. Four of the 24 (17%) tumor-specific mtDNA variants were detected in cfDNA, however at much lower allele frequencies compared to mutations in nuclear-encoded driver genes in the same samples. Also, extensive heterogeneity was observed among the heteroplasmic mtDNA variants present in an individual. We conclude that there is limited value in tracing tumor-specific mtDNA variants in blood-circulating cfDNA with the current methods available.	4
Frequency of the 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene in samples of European, Asian, and African Brazilians. || Africa Asia Brazil Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Europe Humans Polymerase Chain Reaction || Mutations in the GJB2 gene are a major cause of congenital deafness. One specific mutation, the 35delG mutation, has accounted for most of the GJB2 mutations detected in European populations and is one of the most frequent disease mutations identified so far. We evaluated the frequency of the 35delG mutation in DNA samples from Brazilians of European, Asian, and African ancestry. All DNA samples were screened for the 35delG mutation using an allele-specific PCR. This study shows that the frequency of a common mutation (35delG) is significantly lower in non-European populations.	4
Spectrum of Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene Mutations in Hamadan and Lorestan Provinces of Iran and Their Associations with Variable Number of Tandem Repeat Alleles. ||  Iran  Phenylalanine hydroxylase   Variable number of tandem repeats  Phenylketonurias  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is one of the most common known inherited metabolic diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the status of molecular defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) gene in western Iranian PKU patients (predominantly from Kermanshah, Hamadan, and Lorestan provinces) during 2014-2016. Additionally, the results were compared with similar studies in Iran. Nucleotide sequence analysis of all 13 exons and their flanking intronic regions of the <i>PAH</i> gene was performed in 18 western Iranian PKU patients. Moreover, a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) located in the <i>PAH</i> gene was studied. The results revealed a mutational spectrum encompassing 11 distinct mutations distributed along the <i>PAH</i> gene sequence on 34 of the 36 mutant alleles (diagnostic efficiency of 94.4%). Also, four <i>PAH</i> VNTR alleles (with repeats of 3, 7, 8 and 9) were detected. The three most frequent mutations were IVS9+5G>A, IVS7-5T>C, and p.P281L with the frequency of 27.8%, 11%, and 11%, respectively. The results showed that there is not only a consanguineous relation, but also a difference in <i>PAH</i> characters of mutations between Kermanshah and the other two parts of western Iran (Hamadan and Lorestan). Also, it seems that the spectrum of mutations in western Iran is relatively distinct from other parts of the country, suggesting that this region might be a special <i>PAH</i> gene distribution region. Moreover, our findings can be useful in the identification of genotype to phenotype relationship in patients, and provide future abilities for confirmatory diagnostic testing, prognosis, and predict the severity of PKU patients.	3
Born at 27 weeks of gestation with classical PKU: challenges of dietetic management in a very preterm infant. || PAH deficiency dietetic management. phenylketonuria prematurity || Few cases of premature infants with classical phenylketonuria (PKU) have been reported. Treatment of these patients is challenging due to the lack of a phenylalanine (Phe)-free amino acid (AA) solution for parenteral nutrition. A boy born at 27 weeks of gestation with a weight of 1000 g was diagnosed with classical PKU on day 7 because of highly elevated Phe level at newborn screening (2800 µmol/L). Phe intake was suspended for 5 days and during this time intravenous glucose and lipids as well as small amounts of Phe-free formula through nasogastric tube were given. Because of insufficient weight gain attributable to deficiency of essential AA, a Phe-reduced, BCAA-enriched parenteral nutrition was added to satisfy AA requirements without overloading in Phe. Under this regimen, the boy started to gain weight, Phe plasma levels progressively reduced and normalized on day 19. At the age of 40 months, the patient shows normal growth parameters (height 25th percentile, weight 25-50(th) percentile, head circumference 50(th) percentile) with a normal result for formally tested psychomotor development (WPPSI-III). The good outcome of the patient in spite of over 2 weeks of extremely high Phe concentrations suggests that the premature brain may still have enough plasticity to recover. Lacking a Phe-free intravenous AA solution, successful management of premature infants with PKU depends on the child's tolerance of enteral nutrition. Although the coincidence of PKU and prematurity is rare, there is strong need for the development of an appropriate Phe-free amino acid solution for parenteral nutrition especially in case of gastro-intestinal complications of prematurity.	1 3
Detection of hereditary hearing loss gene by DNA microarray. ||  || Screening genes in patients suffering clinically sporadic deafness, using DNA microarray, and evaluating the application value of the clinical detection. DNA extracted from patients' venous blood was amplified by PCR, and hybridization was carried out in a myriad class clean room. Nine mutation sites of four deaf genes commonly seen in Chinese people were tested. Among 24 patients, 7 cases with mutations were detected, with a positive rate of 29.17%. These include 4 cases with GJB2 gene mutation (16.67%), of which 1 case with 176 del 16 site heterozygous mutation; 1 with 235 del C site homozygous mutation; 2 with 299 del AT site heterozygous mutation; 1 with SLC26A4 gene IVS7-2A>G site heterozygous mutation (4.17%), 2 with mitochondrion 12SrRNA gene1555A>G site homogeneous mutation (8.33%). No GJB3 gene mutation was detected. Gene chip technology of hereditary hearing loss can detect related mutation sites of hearing loss rapidly and with high-throughput, which meets the demands of clinical deaf gene detection.	4
PCSK9 Variants, Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Neurocognitive Impairment: Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study (REGARDS). ||  || Despite concerns about adverse neurocognitive events raised by prior trials, pharmacological PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9) inhibition was not associated with neurocognitive effects in a recent phase 3 randomized trial. PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) variants that result in lifelong exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can provide information on the potential long-term effects of lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on neurocognitive impairment and decline. We investigated the association between PCSK9 LOF variants and neurocognitive impairment and decline among black REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) participants with (n=241) and without (n=10 454) C697X or Y142X LOF variants. Neurocognitive tests included the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) battery (Word List Learning, World List Delayed Recall, Semantic Animal Fluency) and Six-Item Screener (SIS) assessments, administered longitudinally during follow-up. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as a score ≥1.5 SD below age, sex, and education-based stratum-specific means on 2 or 3 CERAD assessments or, separately, a score <5 on any SIS assessment at baseline or during follow-up. Neurocognitive decline was assessed using standardized continuous scores on individual neurocognitive tests. The mean sample age was 64 years (SD, 9), 62% were women, and the prevalence of neurocognitive impairment at any assessment was 6.3% by CERAD and 15.4% by SIS definitions. Adjusted odds ratios for neurocognitive impairment for participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants were 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-2.13) using the CERAD battery and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.61-1.30) using the SIS assessment. Standardized average differences in individual neurocognitive assessment scores over the 5.6-year (range, 0.1-9.1) study period ranged between 0.07 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.20) and -0.07 (95% CI, -0.18 to 0.05) among participants with versus without PCSK9 LOF variants. Patterns of neurocognitive decline were similar between participants with and without PCSK9 LOF variants (all P>0.10). Odds ratios for neurocognitive impairment per 20 mg/dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decrements were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.96-1.08) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95-1.02) for the CERAD and SIS definitions of impairment, respectively. These results suggest that lifelong exposure to low PCSK9 levels and cumulative exposure to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are not associated with neurocognitive effects in blacks.	4
Aberrant expression of ETS1 and ETS2 proteins in cancer. ||  || The ETS transcription factors regulate expression of genes involved in normal cell development, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, consisting of 28 family members in humans. Dysregulation of these transcription factors facilitates cell proliferation in cancers, and several members participate in invasion and metastasis by activating gene transcription. ETS1 and ETS2 are the founding members of the ETS family and regulate transcription by binding to ETS sequences. They are both involved in oncogenesis and tumor suppression depending on the biological situations used. The essential roles of ETS proteins in human telomere maintenance have been suggested, which have been linked to creation of new Ets binding sites. Recently, preferential binding of ETS2 to gain-of-function mutant p53 and ETS1 to wild type p53 (WTp53) has been suggested, raising the tumor promoting role for the former and tumor suppressive role for the latter. The oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions of ETS1 and 2 proteins have been discussed.	0
The spectrum of mutations identified in Cypriot patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency detected through neonatal screening. || Alleles Biopterin Cyprus DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Heterogeneity Heterozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation Rate Mutation, Missense Neonatal Screening Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || The purpose of this study was to identify the mutations responsible for phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in Cypriot patients detected through neonatal screening. Analysis of the PAH gene was performed by direct sequencing of the patients' genomic DNA, MLPA analysis and real-time PCR. Among 22 independent alleles thirteen previously described mutations were detected (detection rate 100%), all in compound heterozygosity: p.Arg395Gly (18.2%), c.168+5G>C (13.6%), p.EX3del (9%), c.1066-11G>A (9%), p.Ala403Val (9%), p.Glu178Gly (9%), p.Ser70Pro (4.5%), p.Arg241His (4.5%), p.Phe55fs (4.5%), p.Arg158Gln (4.5%), p.Asp222Gly (4.5%), p.Ala300Ser (4.5%), p.Pro225Thr (4.5%). Of the ten different genotypes, three have been previously reported to be associated with a mild clinical phenotype and to respond to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH₄) administration. Marked genetic heterogeneity was found in Cypriot patients with hyperphenylalaninemia with two mutations accounting for 32% of the alleles. Most of the mutations detected have been found in other European and Mediterranean populations.	1 3
Molecular and genealogical characterization of the R1443X BRCA1 mutation in high-risk French-Canadian breast/ovarian cancer families. || Alleles Amino Acid Substitution BRCA1 Protein Breast Neoplasms Family Female Founder Effect Genes, BRCA1 Haplotypes Humans Male Microsatellite Repeats Ovarian Neoplasms Pedigree Point Mutation Quantitative Trait Loci Quebec Risk Factors || The Quebec population contains about six-million French Canadians, descended from the French settlers who colonized "Nouvelle-France" between 1608 and 1765. Although the relative genetic contribution of each of these founders is highly variable, altogether they account for the major part of the contemporary French-Canadian gene pool. This study was designed to analyze the role of this founder effect in the introduction and diffusion of the BRCA1 recurrent R1443X mutant allele. A highly conserved haplotype, observed in 18 French-Canadian families and generated using 17 microsatellite markers surrounding the BRCA1 locus, supports the fact that the R1443X mutation is a founder mutation in the Quebec population. We also performed haplotyping analysis of R1443X carriers on 19 other families from seven different nationalities; although the same alleles are shared for three markers surrounding the BRCA1 gene, distinct haplotypes were obtained in four families, suggesting multiple origins for the R1443X mutation. Ascending genealogies of the 18 French Canadian families and of controls were reconstructed on an average depth of 10 generations. We identified the founder couple with the highest probability of having introduced the mutation in the population. Based on the descending genealogy of this couple, we detected the presence of geographical concentration in the diffusion pattern of the mutation. This study demonstrates how molecular genetics and demogenetic analyses can complement each other to provide findings that could have an impact on public health. Moreover, this approach is certainly not unique to breast cancer genetics and could be used to understand other complex traits.	4
Sequencing PDX1 (insulin promoter factor 1) in 1788 UK individuals found 5% had a low frequency coding variant, but these variants are not associated with Type 2 diabetes. || Adolescent Adult Case-Control Studies Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genome-Wide Association Study Homeodomain Proteins Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Analysis, DNA Trans-Activators United Kingdom Young Adult || Genome-wide association studies have identified >30 common variants associated with Type 2 diabetes (>5% minor allele frequency). These variants have small effects on individual risk and do not account for a large proportion of the heritable component of the disease. Monogenic forms of diabetes are caused by mutations that occur in <1:2000 individuals and follow strict patterns of inheritance. In contrast, the role of low frequency genetic variants (minor allele frequency 0.1-5%) in Type 2 diabetes is not known. The aim of this study was to assess the role of low frequency PDX1 (also called IPF1) variants in Type 2 diabetes. We sequenced the coding and flanking intronic regions of PDX1 in 910 patients with Type 2 diabetes and 878 control subjects. We identified a total of 26 variants that occurred in 5.3% of individuals, 14 of which occurred once. Only D76N occurred in >1%. We found no difference in carrier frequency between patients (5.7%) and control subjects (5.0%) (P=0.46). There were also no differences between patients and control subjects when analyses were limited to subsets of variants. The strongest subset were those variants in the DNA binding domain where all five variants identified were only found in patients (P=0.06). Approximately 5% of UK individuals carry a PDX1 variant, but there is no evidence that these variants, either individually or cumulatively, predispose to Type 2 diabetes. Further studies will need to consider strategies to assess the role of multiple variants that occur in <1 in 1000 individuals.	4
Genetic inhibition of the atypical kinase Wee1 selectively drives apoptosis of p53 inactive tumor cells. || Apoptosis Caspases Cell Cycle Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation DNA Replication Enzyme Activation Gene Knockdown Techniques Gene Silencing Humans Neoplasms Nuclear Proteins Protein-Tyrosine Kinases RNA, Small Interfering Replication Origin Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumorigenesis is the result of genomic or epigenomic insults and subsequent loss of the proper mechanisms to respond to these alterations leading to unscheduled growth. Tumors arising from these mutations often have altered cell cycles that offer proliferative advantages and lead to the accumulation of additional mutations that can lead to more aggressive phenotypes. Nevertheless, tumor cells must still adhere to the basic tenets of the cell cycle program to ensure their survival by DNA duplication, chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis. The atypical tyrosine kinase Wee1 plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle at the DNA synthesis and mitotic checkpoints via phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in both healthy and tumorigenic cells. To assess the role of Wee1 in tumor cell proliferation we performed small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments in a panel of diverse cell lines derived from various tissue origins. We also tested the hypothesis that any potential effects would be as a result of the kinase activity of Wee1 by siRNA rescue studies with wild-type or kinase-dead versions of Wee1. We find that, in general, cells with wild-type p53 activity are not susceptible to loss of Wee1 protein via siRNA. However, Wee1 siRNA treatment in tumor cells with an inherent loss of p53 activity results in a deregulated cell cycle that causes simultaneous DNA synthesis and premature mitosis and that these effects are kinase dependent. These cumulative effects lead to potent inhibition of cellular proliferation and ultimately caspase-dependent apoptosis in the absence of co-treatment with cytotoxic agents. These results suggest that, while Wee1 acts as a tumor suppressor in the context of normal cell growth and its functional loss can be compensated by p53-dependent DNA damage repairing mechanisms, specific inhibition of Wee1 has deleterious effects on the proliferation and survival of p53 inactive tumors. In total, targeting the atypical kinase Wee1 with an siRNA-based therapeutic or a selective ATP competitive small molecule inhibitor would be a feasible approach to targeting p53 inactive tumors in the clinic.	0
Mutant p53 disrupts mammary tissue architecture via the mevalonate pathway. || Breast Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Female Humans Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Metabolic Networks and Pathways Mevalonic Acid Mutation Prenylation Promoter Regions, Genetic Simvastatin Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a frequent target for mutation in human tumors, and mutant p53 proteins can actively contribute to tumorigenesis. We employed a three-dimensional culture model in which nonmalignant breast epithelial cells form spheroids reminiscent of acinar structures found in vivo, whereas breast cancer cells display highly disorganized morphology. We found that mutant p53 depletion is sufficient to phenotypically revert breast cancer cells to a more acinar-like morphology. Genome-wide expression analysis identified the mevalonate pathway as significantly upregulated by mutant p53. Statins and sterol biosynthesis intermediates reveal that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the phenotypic effects of mutant p53 on breast tissue architecture. Mutant p53 associates with sterol gene promoters at least partly via SREBP transcription factors. Finally, p53 mutation correlates with highly expressed sterol biosynthesis genes in human breast tumors. These findings implicate the mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic target for tumors bearing mutations in p53.	0

Gain-of-Function Activity of Mutant p53 in Lung Cancer through Up-Regulation of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase Axl. ||  || p53 mutations are present in up to 70% of lung cancer. Cancer cells with p53 mutations, in general, grow more aggressively than those with wild-type p53 or no p53. Expression of tumor-derived mutant p53 in cells leads to up-regulated expression of genes that may affect cell growth and oncogenesis. In our study of this aggressive phenotype, we have investigated the receptor protein tyrosine kinase Axl, which is up-regulated by p53 mutants at both RNA and protein levels in H1299 lung cancer cells expressing mutants p53-R175H, -R273H, and -D281G. Knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 levels in human lung cancer cells H1048 (p53-R273C) and H1437 (p53-R267P) led to a reduction in the level of Axl as well. This effect on Axl expression is refractory to the mutations at positions 22 and 23 of p53, suggesting that p53's transactivation domain may not play a critical role in the up-regulation of Axl gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays carried out with acetylated histone antibodies demonstrated induced histone acetylation on the Axl promoter region by mutant p53. Direct mutant p53 nucleation on the Axl promoter was demonstrated by ChIP assays using antibodies against p53. The Axl promoter has a p53/p63 binding site, which however is not required for mutant p53-mediated transactivation. Knockdown of Axl by Axl-specific RNAi caused a reduction of gain-of-function (GOF) activities, reducing the cell growth rate and motility rate in lung cancer cells expressing mutant p53. This indicates that for lung cancer cell lines with mutant p53, GOF activities are mediated in part through Axl.	0
Mutant p53-R273H mediates cancer cell survival and anoikis resistance through AKT-dependent suppression of BCL2-modifying factor (BMF). || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Anoikis Apoptosis Carcinogenesis Cell Survival Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans MCF-7 Cells Mutation, Missense Neoplasms Oncogene Protein v-akt Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is the most frequently mutated tumor-suppressor gene in human cancers. Unlike other tumor-suppressor genes, p53 mutations mainly occur as missense mutations within the DNA-binding domain, leading to the expression of full-length mutant p53 protein. Mutant p53 proteins not only lose their tumor-suppressor function, but may also gain new oncogenic functions and promote tumorigenesis. Here, we showed that silencing of endogenous p53-R273H contact mutant, but not p53-R175H conformational mutant, reduced AKT phosphorylation, induced BCL2-modifying factor (BMF) expression, sensitized BIM dissociation from BCL-XL and induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Importantly, cancer cells harboring endogenous p53-R273H mutant were also found to be inherently resistant to anoikis and lack BMF induction following culture in suspension. Underlying these activities is the ability of p53-R273H mutant to suppress BMF expression that is dependent on constitutively active PI3K/AKT signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that p53-R273H can specifically drive AKT signaling and suppress BMF expression, resulting in enhanced cell survivability and anoikis resistance. These findings open the possibility that blocking of PI3K/AKT will have therapeutic benefit in mutant p53-R273H expressing cancers.	0
Mutant p53 in bone marrow stromal cells increases VEGF expression and supports leukemia cell growth. || Amino Acid Substitution Cell Division Child Coculture Techniques Endothelial Growth Factors Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic Genes, p53 Humans Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Lymphokines Mutation, Missense Neoplasm Proteins Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma Recombinant Fusion Proteins Stromal Cells Transfection Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors || Genetic alterations, including p53 mutations, have been identified in the stroma of solid tumors and are thought be involved in the induction of tumor growth and metastasis. We tested the hypothesis that somatic molecular alterations in bone marrow stromal cells provide a favorable growth environment for leukemic cells. We established an in vitro model consisting of stroma expressing mutant p53 (Cys135Ser) to study its ability to support growth of cells from a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line. Normal and leukemic bone marrow stromal cells were screened for p53 mutations by mutant-specific ELISA, SSCP, and direct sequencing. Secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was measured by quantitative ELISA. Transfection of stromal cells with mutant p53 increased synthesis of VEGF and supported the growth of leukemic cells. An ELISA-based assay suggested the occurrence of in vivo p53 alterations in bone marrow stromal cells from 2 of 12 ALL patients screened. Direct sequencing of one of these samples revealed a somatic heterozygous p53 gene mutation (Asp49His). This sample secreted more VEGF and provided increased growth support to leukemic cells. The ability of Asp 49His-p53 to increase the expression of VEGF was confirmed with transfection experiments in a p53-null cell line. Our findings indicate that genetic alterations, such as p53 mutations, in stromal cells can increase stromal-derived support of leukemia growth. Increased synthesis of pro-angiogenic cytokines, such as VEGF, may constitute one possible pathway by which this process is mediated.	0
Genetics and variation in phenotype in Noonan syndrome. ||  || Noonan syndrome is a well-known clinical entity comprising multiple congenital anomalies characterized by typical facial features, short stature and congenital heart defect. Approximately 50% of cases are sporadic. Familial cases are generally autosomal dominant. In 2001 a gene responsible for Noonan syndrome, PTPN11, encoding for the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, was identified. Mutation analysis of the PTPN11 gene was carried out in Nijmegen in 150 patients with Noonan syndrome. Mutations were found in 68 patients (45%), the most common being A922G in exon 8. In exon 4 a mutation was found that encoded the C-SH2 domain of the PTPN11 gene in two unique patients who shared some uncommon features. A 218C-->T mutation was found in exon 3 in one patient with Noonan syndrome and mild juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia.	4
Low-density DNA microarrays are versatile tools to screen for known mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ||  || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM or CMH) is a myocardial disorder caused by mutations that affect the contractile machinery of heart muscle cells. Genetic testing of HCM patients is hampered by the fact that mutations in at least eight different genes contribute to the disease. An affordable high-throughput mutation detection method is as yet not available. Since a significant number of mutations have been repeatedly found in unrelated families, we consider it feasible to pre-screen patients for known mutations, before more laborious techniques capable of detecting new mutations are applied. Here we demonstrate that the principle of hybridization of DNA to oligonucleotide probes immobilized on chips (glass slides) can be applied for this purpose. We have developed a low-density oligonucleotide probe array capable of detecting 12 different heterozygous mutations (in four different genes), among them single- and double-base exchanges, a single nucleotide insertion, and a trinucleotide deletion. The assay is simple and may be amenable to automation. Detection is achieved with a CCD camera-based fluorescence biochip reader. The technique turned out to be robust: Variations in either the relative position of a mutation, or the amount and size of target-DNA were compatible with mutation detection. Mutations could even be detected in amplicons as long as 800 bp, allowing the screening of more than one exon in one amplicon. Our data suggest that the development of a chip that covers all or most of known HCM-associated mutations is feasible and useful.	4
Clinical Application of Multigene Panels: Challenges of Next-Generation Counseling and Cancer Risk Management. ||  || Multigene panels can be a cost- and time-effective alternative to sequentially testing multiple genes, especially with a mixed family cancer phenotype. However, moving beyond our single-gene testing paradigm has unveiled many new challenges to the clinician. The purpose of this article is to familiarize the reader with some of the challenges, as well as potential opportunities, of expanded hereditary cancer panel testing. We include results from 348 commercial multigene panel tests ordered from January 1, 2014, through October 1, 2014, by clinicians associated with the City of Hope's Clinical Cancer Genetics Community of Practice. We also discuss specific challenging cases that arose during this period involving abnormalities in the genes: CDH1, TP53, PMS2, PALB2, CHEK2, NBN, and RAD51C. If historically high risk genes only were included in the panels (BRCA1, BRCA2, MSH6, PMS2, TP53, APC, CDH1), the results would have been positive only 6.2% of the time, instead of 17%. Results returned with variants of uncertain significance (VUS) 42% of the time. These figures and cases stress the importance of adequate pre-test counseling in anticipation of higher percentages of positive, VUS, unexpected, and ambiguous test results. Test result ambiguity can be limited by the use of phenotype-specific panels; if found, multiple resources (the literature, reference laboratory, colleagues, national experts, and research efforts) can be accessed to better clarify counseling and management for the patient and family. For pathogenic variants in low and moderate risk genes, empiric risk modeling based on the patient's personal and family history of cancer may supersede gene-specific risk. Commercial laboratory and patient contributions to public databases and research efforts will be needed to better classify variants and reduce clinical ambiguity of multigene panels.	4
Exploring the interactions of the RAS family in the human protein network and their potential implications in RAS-directed therapies. || Amino Acid Sequence Carrier Proteins Computational Biology Conserved Sequence Databases, Protein Humans Mutation Neoplasms Phylogeny Protein Binding Protein Interaction Mapping Protein Interaction Maps Signal Transduction ras Proteins || RAS proteins are the founding members of the RAS superfamily of GTPases. They are involved in key signaling pathways regulating essential cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation. As a result, their deregulation by inactivating mutations often results in aberrant cell proliferation and cancer. With the exception of the relatively well-known KRAS, HRAS and NRAS proteins, little is known about how the interactions of the other RAS human paralogs affect cancer evolution and response to treatment. In this study we performed a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the phylogeny of RAS proteins and their location in the protein interaction network. This analysis was integrated with the structural analysis of conserved positions in available 3D structures of RAS complexes. Our results show that many RAS proteins with divergent sequences are found close together in the human interactome. We found specific conserved amino acid positions in this group that map to the binding sites of RAS with many of their signaling effectors, suggesting that these pairs could share interacting partners. These results underscore the potential relevance of cross-talking in the RAS signaling network, which should be taken into account when considering the inhibitory activity of drugs targeting specific RAS oncoproteins. This study broadens our understanding of the human RAS signaling network and stresses the importance of considering its potential cross-talk in future therapies.	0
Co-expression of phenylalanine hydroxylase variants and effects of interallelic complementation on in vitro enzyme activity and genotype-phenotype correlation. || Alleles Animals Biopterin COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops Chromatography, Liquid Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Complementation Test Genetic Vectors Genotype Heterozygote Humans Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Recombinant Fusion Proteins Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization || In phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, the combination of two phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) alleles is the main determinant of residual enzyme activity in vivo and in vitro. Inconsistencies in genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed in compound heterozygous patients and a particular combination of two PAH alleles may produce a phenotype that is different from the expected one, possibly due to interallelic complementation. A dual eukaryotic vector system with two distinct PAH proteins N-terminally fused to different epitope tags was used to investigate the co-expression of PAH alleles reported in patients with inconsistent phenotypes. PAH variant proteins were transiently co-transfected in COS-7 cells. PAH activity was measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS), and protein expression was measured by Western blot. Genotypes were compared with predicted PAH activity from the PAH locus-specific database (PAHvdb) and with phenotypes and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) responsiveness from more than 10,000 PKU patients (BIOPKU database). Through the expression and co-expression of 17 variant alleles we demonstrated that interallelic interaction could be both positive and negative. The co-expressions of p.[I65T];[R261Q] (19.5% activity; predicted 43.5%) and p.[I65T];[R408W] (15.0% vs. 26.8% activity) are examples of genotypes with negative interallelic interaction. The co-expressions of p.[E178G];[Q232E] (55.0% vs.36.4%) and p.[P384S];[R408W] (56.1% vs. 40.8%) are examples of positive subunit interactions. Inconsistencies of PAH residual enzyme activity in vitro and of PKU patients' phenotypes were observed as well. The PAH activity of p.[R408W];[A300S] is 18.0% of the wild-type activity; however, 88% of patients with this genotype exhibit mild hyperphenylalaninemias (MHPs). The co-expression of two distinct PAH variants revealed possible dominance effects (positive or negative) by one of the variants on residual PAH activity as a result of interallelic complementation.	0
Depletion of pro-oncogenic RUNX2 enhances gemcitabine (GEM) sensitivity of p53-mutated pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells through the induction of pro-apoptotic TAp63. || Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit Deoxycytidine Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Genes, p53 Humans Membrane Proteins Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms || Recently, we have described that siRNA-mediated silencing of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) improves anti-cancer drug gemcitabine (GEM) sensitivity of p53-deficient human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells through the augmentation of p53 family TAp63-dependent cell death pathway. In this manuscript, we have extended our study to p53-mutated human pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells. According to our present results, knockdown of mutant p53 alone had a marginal effect on GEM-mediated cell death of Panc-1 cells. We then sought to deplete RUNX2 using siRNA in Panc-1 cells and examined its effect on GEM sensitivity. Under our experimental conditions, RUNX2 knockdown caused a significant enhancement of GEM sensitivity of Panc-1 cells. Notably, GEM-mediated induction of TAp63 but not of TAp73 was further stimulated in RUNX2-depleted Panc-1 cells, indicating that, like AsPC-1 cells, TAp63 might play a pivotal role in the regulation of GEM sensitivity of Panc-1 cells. Consistent with this notion, forced expression of TAp63α in Panc-1 cells promoted cell cycle arrest and/or cell death, and massively increased luciferase activities driven by TAp63-target gene promoters such as p21WAF1 and NOXA. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RUNX2 forms a complex with TAp63 in Panc-1 cells. Taken together, our current observations strongly suggest that depletion of RUNX2 enhances the cytotoxic effect of GEM on p53-mutated Panc-1 cells through the stimulation of TAp63-dependent cell death pathway even in the presence of a large amount of pro-oncogenic mutant p53, and might provide an attractive strategy to treat pancreatic cancer patients with p53 mutations.	0
Carrier frequency of the 35delG and A1555G deafness mutations in the Argentinean population. Impact on the newborn hearing screening. || Argentina Connexin 26 Connexins Hearing Loss Heterozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Mutation Needs Assessment Neonatal Screening RNA RNA, Mitochondrial RNA, Ribosomal || Hearing loss is a complex multifactorial disorder caused by genetic and environmental factors. The 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene is the most prevalent mutation in Caucasian patients with genetic sensorineural deafness. The A1555G mutation in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA is the main genetic alteration associated with aminoglycoside-induced deafness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of both mutations in general population of Argentina. A total of 712 samples of unrelated healthy blood donors and 330 newborn dried blood spots were studied by PCR-RFLP. The 35delG mutation was detected in 11/ 712 unrelated blood donors. The carrier frequency found in this sample (1/65) proved to be lower than that found in Southern European countries, mainly Spain and Italy, from where Argentina originally received its major immigration waves. When the populations of Southern Europe were considered altogether, this difference reached statistical significance. The A1555G mutation was not found in any of the 1042 samples tested. Taking into account the 35delG carrier frequency found in this study, it could be estimated that 130-160 children with congenital deafness due to mutations in the connexin genes would be born per year in Argentina. In contrast, the mitochondrial mutation A1555G appears to be infrequent in general Argentinean population.	4
Clinical Outcomes and Co-Occurring Mutations in Patients with RUNX1-Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia. || Adult Age Factors Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Cohort Studies Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit DNA Methylation Female Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Male Middle Aged Mutation Prognosis Repressor Proteins Treatment Outcome fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 || (1) Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often associated with worse prognosis. We assessed co-occurring mutations, response to therapy, and clinical outcomes in patients with and without mutantRUNX1 (mRUNX1); (2) We analyzed 328 AML patients, including 177 patients younger than 65 years who received intensive chemotherapy and 151 patients >65 years who received hypomethylating agents.RUNX1 and co-existing mutations were identified using next-generation sequencing; (3)RUNX1 mutations were identified in 5.1% of younger patients and 15.9% of older patients, and were significantly associated with increasing age (p = 0.01) as well as intermediate-risk cytogenetics including normal karyotype (p = 0.02) in the elderly cohort, and with lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH;p = 0.02) and higher platelet count (p = 0.012) overall. Identified co-occurring mutations were primarilyASXL1 mutations in older patients andRAS mutations in younger patients; FLT3-ITD and IDH1/2 co-mutations were also frequent. YoungermRUNX1 AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy experienced inferior treatment outcomes. In older patients with AML treated with hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy, response and survival was independent ofRUNX1 status. OldermRUNX1 patients with prior myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) had particularly dismal outcome. Future studies should focus on the prognostic implications ofRUNX1 mutations relative to other co-occurring mutations, and the potential role of hypomethylating agents for this molecularly-defined group.	4
Drug resistance originating from a TGF-β/FGF-2-driven epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and its reversion in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines harboring an EGFR mutation. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Antineoplastic Agents B7-H1 Antigen Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Cisplatin Dimethyl Sulfoxide Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition ErbB Receptors Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 Gefitinib Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Indoles Lung Neoplasms Metformin Mutation Purines Quinazolines Transforming Growth Factor beta || Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a malignant cancer phenotype characterized by augmented invasion and metastasis, chemoresistance, and escape from host-immunity. This study sought to identify efficient methods for inducing EMT reversion, to evaluate alterations in chemosensitivity and immune-protectiveness, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In this study, the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-9 and HCC-827, harboring an EGFR mutation, were treated with TGF-β and FGF-2 to induce EMT. The phenotypic alterations were evaluated by RT-PCR, fluorescent immunohistochemistry, cell-mobility, and flow cytometry. Chemosensitivity to gefitinib and cisplatin was evaluated using an MTT assay and apoptosis. Immune-protectiveness was evaluated by PD-L1 expression. A combination of TGF-β and FGF-2 efficiently induced EMT in both cell lines: through Smad3 pathway in PC-9, and through Smad3, MEK/Erk, and mTOR pathways in HCC-827. The mTOR inhibitor PP242, metformin, and DMSO reverted EMT to different extent and through different pathways, depending on the cell lines. EMT induction reduced the sensitivity to gefitinib in both cell lines and to cisplatin in HCC-827, and it increased PD-L1 expression in both cell lines. EMT reversion using each of the 3 agents partly restored chemosensitivity and suppressed PD-L1 expression. Thus, chemoresistance and increased PD-L1 expression caused by EMT can be successfully reverted by EMT-reverting agents.	0
[Identification of novel mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene of classical phenylketonuria]. ||  || To investigate the mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene in the cases of classical phenylketonuria (PKU). The exons 3-12 of the PAH gene in 32 PKU patients from Inner Mongolia were studied by using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism technique and DNA direct sequencing. Fourteen point mutations were identified. The frequencies of mutations were R243Q (12/64), Y356X (6/64), Y204C (5/64), R261Q (2/64), Y161S (2/64), R252Q (1/64), R111X (2/64), D282G (1/64), S303P (1/64), G239D (1/64), R413P (1/64), IVS7nt+2 (2/64), IVS4nt+3 (1/64) and IVS9nt+34 (2/64). Two novel mutations IVS4nt+3 (G>C) and IVS9nt+34 (G>A) were first found. The S303P (T>C) and D282G (A>G) were first documented in Chinese PAH gene. This study demonstrated the variety of the mutation type PAH gene of PKU in Inner Mongolia population, and confirmed that R243Q, Y356X, Y204C were the hot spots of PAH gene mutation.	1 3
Prognostic impact of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in primary colorectal carcinomas: a population-based study. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Colorectal Neoplasms Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Genetic Association Studies Genetic Testing Geography Humans Italy Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Mutation Rate Prognosis Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) || Activation of oncogenes downstream the EGFR gene contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis and determines the sensitivity to anti-EGFR treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA mutations in a large collection of CRC patients from genetically-homogeneous Sardinian population. A total of 1284 Sardinian patients with histologically-proven diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and presenting with metastatic disease were included into the study. Genomic DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumour tissue samples of CRC patients and screened for mutations in RAS and BRAF genes, using pyrosequencing assays, and in PIK3CA gene, using automated DNA sequencing assays. Overall, mutation rates were 35.6 % for KRAS, 4.1 % for NRAS, and 2.1 % for BRAF. Among available DNA samples, 114/796 (14.3 %) primary CRCs were found to carry a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. In this subset of patients analysed in all four genes, a pathogenetic mutation of at least one gene was discovered in about half (378/796; 47.5 %) of CRC cases. A mutated BRAF gene was found to steadily act as a negative prognostic factor for either time to progression as metastatic disease (from detection of primary CRC to diagnosis of first distant metastasis; p = 0.009) or partial survival (from diagnosis of advanced disease to the time of death or last control; p = 0.006) or overall survival (p < 0.001). No significant impact on prognosis was observed for mutated KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA genes or combined RAS mutations (all RAS). Our study defines both prevalence and prognostic role of main activated oncogenes in a population-based large collection of CRC patients.	4

Evaluation of a diagnostic protocol. setting: Patient participants were enrolled during clinical appointments in a university-based ophthalmic genetics clinic. Twenty-six patients with a variety of presumed hereditary retinal dystrophies. Participants were offered whole exome sequencing in addition to clinically available sequencing gene panels between July 2012 and January 2013 to determine the molecular etiology of their retinal dystrophy. Diagnostic yield and acceptability of whole exome sequencing in patients with retinal disorders. Twenty-six of 29 eligible patients (∼90%) who were approached opted to undergo molecular testing. Each participant chose whole exome sequencing in addition to, or in lieu of, clinically available sequencing gene panels. Time to obtain informed consent was manageable in the clinical context. Whole exome sequencing successfully identified known pathogenic mutations or suspected deleterious variants in 57.7% of participants. Additionally, 1 participant had 2 autosomal dominant medically actionable incidental findings (unrelated to retinopathy) that were reported to enable the participant to take preventive action and reduce risk for future disease. In this study, we identified the molecular etiology for more than half of all participants. Additionally, we found that participants were widely accepting of whole exome sequencing and the possibility of being informed about medically actionable incidental findings.	4
Approaching the facts between genetic mutation and clinical practice of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: A case report with RAF1 770C>T mutant. || Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Infant Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the most common cardiomyopathies, which induces sudden cardiac death. Several mutants have been identified among HCM cases. A 10-month female infant who experienced cough, fever, aggressive exertional dyspnea, and recurrent cyanosis was admitted to our hospital. The patient was first diagnosed with type I respiratory failure, dysfunction of heart, severe pneumonia, and also some cardiac disorders were suspected. The echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography scan, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan, and also electrocardiogram were performed to confirm a diagnosis of HCM. Moreover, the whole-genome sequencing and chromatin analysis have been suggested. Based on the sequencing analysis, a new heterozygous mutant of RAF1 at c. 770C>T had been identified in absence of the same mutant in both her parents. Besides, the existence of normal karyotypes was confirmed among 3 samples. So we first reported a single mutant of RAF1 770C>T with idiopathic HCM in a very early age. This patient would have suffered significant cardiac ventricular hypertrophy with more severe clinical manifestation in an extremely younger age compared with other identified mutations. However, we could only take limited advantages of deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing in HCM diagnosis and therapy. Reporting additional observations of well designed cohorts with a long-term follow-up would be very helpful to accelerate the transition of genetic molecular research on HCM.	4
Long Non-coding MIR205HG Depletes Hsa-miR-590-3p Leading to Unrestrained Proliferation in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma. || Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Gene Expression Profiling Gene Regulatory Networks Gene Silencing Humans MicroRNAs Mutant Proteins Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Over 70% of head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients carry TP53 oncogenic mutations. Here we studied the role of specific tumor-derived mutant p53 proteins in the aberrant transcription of long non-coding (lnc)MIR205HG gene in head and neck cancer cells.Methods: To understand the role of lncMIR205HG, that we showed to be transcriptionally regulated by mutant p53 in HNSCC, we have employed siRNA and shRNA in CAL27 and FaDu HNSCC cell lines to suppress p53 gene expression in ChIP assays and RT-qPCR. We validated our findings in a cohort of 522 HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal (TCGA). We further evaluated our results in 63 HNSCC tumor samples collected at our institute, 32 of which were characterized by mutatedTP53 (missense mutations) while 31 were characterized by wild-typeTP53.Results: Maturation of pre-MIR205HG transcript produces two non-coding RNAs, lncMIR205HG and hsa-miR-205-5p. Down-regulation of lncMIR205HG expression significantly reduced cell proliferation, cell migration and clonogenic activity of head and neck cancer cells. Expression of MIR205HG was significantly increased in HNSCC with mutatedTP53 when compared with matched non-tumoral tissues. Furthermore, MIR205HG expression levels were significantly higher in tumoral samples with mutant p53 than in tumoral tissues expressing wild-type p53. Mechanistically, MIR205HG depletes endogenous miR-590-3p leading to increased cyclin B, cdk1, and YAP protein expression.Conclusions: Taken together, these findings identify a transcriptional and post-transcriptional molecular network that includes mutant p53 protein, lncMIR205HG, YAP, and other proliferation-related genes, which are enriched in HNSCC patients with poor prognosis.	0
Mutant p53 and mTOR/PKM2 regulation in cancer cells. || Carrier Proteins Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Glycolysis Humans Membrane Proteins Mutation Neoplasms Phosphorylation Signal Transduction TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases Thyroid Hormones Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Mutations of TP53 gene are the most common feature in aggressive malignant cells. In addition to the loss of the tumor suppressive role of wild-type p53, hotspot mutant p53 isoforms display oncogenic proprieties notoriously referred as gain of functions (GOFs) which result in chemoresistance to therapies, genomic instability, aberrant deregulation of cell cycle progression, invasiveness and enhanced metastatic potential, and finally, in patient poor survival rate. The identification of novel functional oncogenic pathways regulated by mutant p53 represent and intriguing topic for emerging therapies against a broad spectrum of cancer types bearing mutant TP53 gene. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as well as pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) are master regulators of cancer growth, metabolism, and cell proliferation. Herein, we report that GOF mutant R175H and R273H p53 proteins trigger PKM2 phosphorylation on Tyr 105 through the involvement of mTOR signaling. Our data, together with the newly discovered connection between mutant p53 and mTOR stimulation, raise important implications for the potential therapeutic use of synthetic drugs inhibiting mTOR/PKM2 axis in cancer cells bearing mutant TP53 gene. We further hypothesize that mTOR/PKM2 pathway stimulation serves to sustain the oncogenic activity of mutant p53 through both the enhancement of chemoresistance and of aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells. © 2016 IUBMB Life, 68(9):722-726, 2016.	0
Implementing precision cancer medicine in the public health services of Norway: the diagnostic infrastructure and a cost estimate. ||  || Through the conduct of an individual-based intervention study, the main purpose of this project was to build and evaluate the required infrastructure that may enable routine practice of precision cancer medicine in the public health services of Norway, including modelling of costs. An eligible patient had end-stage metastatic disease from a solid tumour. Metastatic tissue was analysed by DNA sequencing, using a 50-gene panel and a study-generated pipeline for analysis of sequence data, supplemented with fluorescence in situ hybridisation to cover relevant biomarkers. Cost estimations compared best supportive care, biomarker-agnostic treatment with a molecularly targeted agent and biomarker-based treatment with such a drug. These included costs for medication, outpatient clinic visits, admission from adverse events and the biomarker-based procedures. The diagnostic procedures, which comprised sampling of metastatic tissue, mutation analysis and data interpretation at the Molecular Tumor Board before integration with clinical data at the Clinical Tumor Board, were completed in median 18 (8-39) days for the 22 study patients. The 23 invasive procedures (12 from liver, 6 from lung, 5 from other sites) caused a single adverse event (pneumothorax). Per patient, 0-5 mutations were detected in metastatic tumours; however, no actionable target case was identified for the current single-agent therapy approach. Based on the cost modelling, the biomarker-based approach was 2.5-fold more costly than best supportive care and 2.5-fold less costly than the biomarker-agnostic option. The first project phase established a comprehensive diagnostic infrastructure for precision cancer medicine, which enabled expedite and safe mutation profiling of metastatic tumours and data interpretation at multidisciplinary tumour boards for patients with end-stage cancer. Furthermore, it prepared for protocol amendments, recently approved by the designated authorities for the second study phase, allowing more comprehensive mutation analysis and opportunities to define therapy targets.	4
The C679X mutation in PCSK9 is present and lowers blood cholesterol in a Southern African population. || Adult Cholesterol, LDL Codon, Nonsense Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Serine Endopeptidases Zimbabwe || Missense mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene (PCSK9) can cause familial hypercholesterolemia. However, two nonsense variants of PCSK9, Y142X and C679X, found in approximately 2% of black American subjects, are associated with a 28% reduction in mean low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. We sought to determine the frequency and effect of these nonsense variants in an African population. PCSK9 genotypes were determined in 653 black African women attending two antenatal clinics in Zimbabwe. C679X occurred in 3.7% of subjects and was associated with a 27% reduction in LDL-cholesterol (1.6+/-0.3 mmol/L versus 2.2+/-0.7 mmol/L in non-carriers). We did not observe the Y142X variant. Our results show that the PCSK9 C679X variant has a marked cholesterol-lowering effect.	4
Novel USH2A mutations in Japanese Usher syndrome type 2 patients: marked differences in the mutation spectrum between the Japanese and other populations. || Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Female Genotype Haplotypes Humans Japan Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Usher Syndromes || Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa and hearing loss. USH type 2 (USH2) is the most common type of USH and is frequently caused by mutations in USH2A. In a recent mutation screening of USH2A in Japanese USH2 patients, we identified 11 novel mutations in 10 patients and found the possible frequent mutation c.8559-2A>G in 4 of 10 patients. To obtain a more precise mutation spectrum, we analyzed further nine Japanese patients in this study. We identified nine mutations, of which eight were novel. This result indicates that the mutation spectrum for USH2A among Japanese patients largely differs from Caucasian, Jewish and Palestinian patients. Meanwhile, we did not find the c.8559-2A>G in this study. Haplotype analysis of the c.8559-2G (mutated) alleles using 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms surrounding the mutation revealed an identical haplotype pattern of at least 635 kb in length, strongly suggesting that the mutation originated from a common ancestor. The fact that all patients carrying c.8559-2A>G came from western Japan suggests that the mutation is mainly distributed in that area; indeed, most of the patients involved in this study came from eastern Japan, which contributed to the absence of c.8559-2A>G.	1
Glucose, not glutamine, is the dominant energy source required for proliferation and survival of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells. || Adenosine Triphosphate Carcinoma Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Cell Cycle Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Chromatography, Liquid Deoxyglucose Disease Progression Genes, p53 Glucose Glutamine Head and Neck Neoplasms Humans Lactic Acid Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics Metformin Neoplasms, Squamous Cell Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck Treatment Outcome Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Tumor metabolism is an essential contributor to disease progression and response to treatment. An understanding of the metabolic phenotype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will allow the development of appropriate antimetabolic strategies for this tumor type. A panel of 15 HNSCC cell lines was assayed for glucose and glutamine dependence and sensitivity to metabolic inhibitors. In addition, broad-spectrum metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography was combined with individual measurements of reducing potential, adenosine triphosphate, and lactate production to characterize cellular metabolic phenotypes. HNSCC energy and reducing potential levels closely mirrored extracellular glucose concentrations. Glucose starvation induced cell death despite the activation of secondary energetic pathways. Conversely, glutamine was not required for HNSCC survival and did not serve as a significant source of energy. 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and its fluorinated derivative decreased glycolytic and Krebs cycle activity, cellular energy, and reducing potential and inhibited HNSCC cell proliferation. 2-DG effects were potentiated by the addition of metformin, but not by inhibitors of the pentose phosphate pathway or glutaminolysis. Despite dependence on glucose catabolism, the authors identified a subset of cell lines with relative resistance to starvation. Exploration of 1 such cell line (HN30) suggested that the presence of wild-type p53 can partially protect tumor cells from glucose starvation. HNSCC tumor cells are dependent on glucose, not glutamine, for energy production and survival, providing a rationale for treatment strategies that target glucose catabolism. However, antimetabolic strategies may need to be tailored to the tumor background, more specifically, p53 status.	0
Coronary Artery Calcification and Rheumatoid Arthritis: Lack of Relationship to Risk Alleles for Coronary Artery Disease in the General Population. || Alleles Arthritis, Rheumatoid Coronary Artery Disease Female Humans Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Risk Factors Vascular Calcification || Coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population is characterized by an increased frequency of particular susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Because the frequency of CAD is increased among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we sought to determine whether the frequency of these SNPs is increased in RA patients with CAD, hypothesizing that RA could enhance CAD risk by acting through established genetic pathways predisposing to CAD. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) as detected by computed tomography was used as a measure of CAD in 561 patients with RA. One hundred SNPs associated with CAD in the general population were genotyped or imputed, and their relationship to CAC was established through multiple regression analysis for individual SNPs and a genetic risk score representing their cumulative effect. Ninety-one CAD-related SNPs were genotyped successfully; of these, 81 exhibited no association with CAC (Agatston units) or different CAC categorizations, either individually or collectively, in the genetic risk score. Only rs579459 (ABO) and rs17676451 (HAL) had a consistent positive association between genotype and CAC, with a significant increase in the frequency of the effect allele in both homozygous and heterozygous genotype distributions. Five were variably negatively associated. Furthermore, a positive association between the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints and CAC was observed, and after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, it was not modified by correcting for the CAD-related SNP genetic risk score. The increased risk of CAC in patients with RA does not appear to operate primarily through established genetically regulated atherogenic mechanisms that are preponderant in the general population.	4
Health and quality of life in adults with Noonan syndrome. || Adult Body Height Chronic Disease Comorbidity Educational Status Female Health Status Health Status Indicators Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Prognosis Quality of Life || To obtain information on health and quality of life in adults with Noonan syndrome. From a cohort of 144 children with the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome whose height data had been published 23 years ago, 103 pediatric files providing adequate data were identified. Participants were sent questionnaires and asked to provide saliva for DNA analysis and to return for physical examination. Ten of 103 individuals had died, 3 of them suddenly (standardized mortality ratio, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.44-5.52). Eighty-one individuals could be contacted by mail, with a positive response from 45. Genotyping in 36 of 45 participants revealed characteristic mutations in 61%. Median age at follow-up was 42.8 years. Mean adult heights were 169.2 cm (men) and 154.4 cm (women). In comparison with the general population, participants had lower educational status and lived more frequently without any partner. According to the response to the Short Form-36 questionnaire, quality of life was not impaired. Individuals with Noonan syndrome have higher mortality, lower education, and rarely partnership. Quality of life according to self-reported Short Form-36 was good. Men grew taller than previously reported from this cohort.	4
Unraveling of Enigmatic Hearing-Impaired GJB2 Single Heterozygotes by Massive Parallel Sequencing: DFNB1 or Not? || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Infant Male Mutation Pedigree || The molecular etiology of nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in subjects with only one detectable autosomal recessive GJB2 mutation is unclear. Here, we report GJB2 single heterozygotes with various final genetic diagnoses and suggest appropriate diagnostic strategies. A total of 160 subjects with SNHL without phenotypic markers were screened for GJB2 mutations. Single-nucleotide variants or structural variations within the DFNB1 locus or in other deafness genes were examined by Sanger sequencing, breakpoint PCR, and targeted exome sequencing (TES) of 129 deafness genes. We identified 27 subjects with two mutations and 10 subjects with only one detectable mutation in GJB2. The detection rate of the single GJB2 mutation among the 160 SNHL subjects in the present study (6.25%) was higher than 2.58% in normal hearing controls in Korean. The DFNB1 was clearly excluded as a molecular etiology in four (40%) subjects: other recessive deafness genes (N = 3) accounted for SNHL and the causative gene for the other non-DFNB1 subject (N = 1) was not identified. The etiology of additional two subjects was potentially explained by digenic etiology (N = 2) of GJB2 with MITF and GJB3, respectively. The contribution of the single GJB2 mutation in the four remaining subjects is unclear. Comprehensive diagnostic testing including TES is prerequisite for understanding GJB2 single heterozygotes.	4
Heterogeneous Mechanisms of Secondary Resistance and Clonal Selection in Sarcoma during Treatment with Nutlin. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Autophagy Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Clone Cells Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Expression Profiling Humans Imidazoles Mutation Ploidies Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Pyrrolidines Sarcoma Sequence Analysis, RNA Signal Transduction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 para-Aminobenzoates || Nutlin inhibits TP53-MDM2 interaction and is under investigation in soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) and other malignancies. Molecular mechanisms of secondary resistance to nutlin in STS are unknown. We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on three pretreatment and secondary resistant STS cell lines selected based on their high primary sensitivity to nutlin. Our data identified a subset of cancer gene mutations and ploidy variations that were positively selected following treatment, including TP53 mutations in 2 out of 3 resistant cell lines. Further, secondary resistance to nutlin was associated with deregulation of apoptosis-related genes and marked productive autophagy, the inhibition of which resulted in significant restoration of nutlin-induced cell death. Collectively, our findings argue that secondary resistance to nutlin in STS involved heterogeneous mechanisms resulting from clonal evolution and several biological pathways. Alternative dosing regimens and combination with other targeted agents are needed to achieve successful development of nutlin in the clinical setting.	0
Detection of endometrial precancer by a targeted gynecologic cancer liquid biopsy. ||  || Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in industrialized countries, and both its incidence and its associated mortality are increasing. The "liquid biopsy" is becoming an important transformative precision oncology tool, but barriers intrinsic to blood sampling have limited its use in early cancer detection. We hypothesized that using a more targeted sample for analysis-namely, a uterine lavage-should provide a more sensitive and specific diagnostic test for endometrial cancer. Using a custom 12-gene endometrial cancer panel, molecular analysis of uterine lavage fluid from an asymptomatic 67-yr-old female without histopathologic evidence of premalignant lesions or cancer in her uterine tissue revealed two oncogenic PTEN mutations. Ten months later, the patient returned with postmenopausal bleeding and a single microscopic focus of endometrial cancer. DNA isolated and sequenced from laser-capture microdissected tumor tissue revealed the same twoPTEN mutations. These mutations were unlikely to occur by chance alone (P < 3 × 10-7). This illustrative case provides the first demonstration that future, tumor-specific mutations can be identified in an asymptomatic individual without clinical or pathologic evidence of cancer by using already established sequencing technologies but targeted sampling methods. This finding provides the basis for new opportunities in early cancer screening, detection, and prevention.	4
Structural basis for ligand-dependent dimerization of phenylalanine hydroxylase regulatory domain. || Allosteric Regulation Binding Sites Humans Ligands Models, Molecular Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Protein Binding Protein Conformation Protein Multimerization Scattering, Small Angle || The multi-domain enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) catalyzes the hydroxylation of dietary I-phenylalanine (Phe) to I-tyrosine. Inherited mutations that result in PAH enzyme deficiency are the genetic cause of the autosomal recessive disorder phenylketonuria. Phe is the substrate for the PAH active site, but also an allosteric ligand that increases enzyme activity. Phe has been proposed to bind, in addition to the catalytic domain, a site at the PAH N-terminal regulatory domain (PAH-RD), to activate the enzyme via an unclear mechanism. Here we report the crystal structure of human PAH-RD bound with Phe at 1.8 Å resolution, revealing a homodimer of ACT folds with Phe bound at the dimer interface. This work delivers the structural evidence to support previous solution studies that a binding site exists in the RD for Phe, and that Phe binding results in dimerization of PAH-RD. Consistent with our structural observation, a disease-associated PAH mutant impaired in Phe binding disrupts the monomer:dimer equilibrium of PAH-RD. Our data therefore support an emerging model of PAH allosteric regulation, whereby Phe binds to PAH-RD and mediates the dimerization of regulatory modules that would bring about conformational changes to activate the enzyme.	0
Arsenic trioxide reactivates proteasome-dependent degradation of mutant p53 protein in cancer cells in part via enhanced expression of Pirh2 E3 ligase. || Arsenic Trioxide Arsenicals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockdown Techniques HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Humans Mutant Proteins Oxides Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex Protein Binding Proteolysis Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases Ubiquitination || The p53 gene is mutated in more than 50% of human tumors. Mutant p53 exerts an oncogenic function and is often highly expressed in cancer cells due to evasion of proteasome-dependent degradation. Thus, reactivating proteasome-dependent degradation of mutant p53 protein is an attractive strategy for cancer management. Previously, we found that arsenic trioxide (ATO), a drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia, degrades mutant p53 protein through a proteasome pathway. However, it remains unclear what is the E3 ligase that targets mutant p53 for degradation. In current study, we sought to identify an E3 ligase necessary for ATO-mediated degradation of mutant p53. We found that ATO induces expression of Pirh2 E3 ligase at the transcriptional level. We also found that knockdown of Pirh2 inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 enhances, ATO-induced degradation of mutant p53 protein. Furthermore, we found that Pirh2 E3 ligase physically interacts with and targets mutant p53 for polyubiquitination and subsequently proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, we found that ATO cooperates with HSP90 or HDAC inhibitor to promote mutant p53 degradation and growth suppression in tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that ATO promotes mutant p53 degradation in part via induction of the Pirh2-dependent proteasome pathway.	0
Protective effect of the Y220C mutant p53 against steatosis: good news? || Apoptosis Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Disease Progression Fatty Acids, Nonesterified Fatty Liver Hep G2 Cells Hepatocytes Humans Liver Neoplasms Mutation Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Oxidative Stress Reactive Oxygen Species Signal Transduction Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, which may progress to fibrosis, and cirrhosis, leading eventually to hepatocarcinoma development. Recently, cases of hepatocarcinoma have been diagnosed in steatotic patients without nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. The p53 protein, besides its function as tumor suppressor, is emerging as an important regulator of cellular metabolism, but its role in steatosis remains unclear. We induced steatosis in HepG2 (wt-p53) and Huh7.5.1 (Y220C-mutant p53) cells using free fatty acids. We observed a different modulation of p53, different intracellular lipid content, and similar down-regulation of the de novo lipid synthesis genes but opposite modulation of the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway between HepG2 and Huh7.5.1. Accordingly, we found a diverse amount of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species between the two cell lines. Transfection of the wt-p53 in Huh7.5.1 cells reverted the different lipid metabolism behavior observed in these cells. In conclusion, unlike the wt-p53, the Y220C mutant provides a specific protection against steatosis and potentially against its progression. Our findings highlight for the first time an unknown role of a p53 mutant in the setting of steatosis. Being this mutation very frequent in human cancers, this study could be a breakthrough in explaining the occurrence of hepatocarcinoma in steatotic patients without NASH and cirrhosis.	0
Plasma globotriaosylsphingosine: diagnostic value and relation to clinical manifestations of Fabry disease. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Fabry Disease Female Glycolipids Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Predictive Value of Tests Prognosis Severity of Illness Index Sphingolipids Young Adult alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to deficiency of alpha-Galactosidase A, causing accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and elevated plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3). The diagnostic value and clinical relevance of plasma lysoGb3 concentration was investigated. All male and adult female patients with classical Fabry disease could be discerned by an elevated plasma lysoGb3. In young pre-symptomatic Fabry heterozygotes, lysoGb3 levels can be normal. Individuals carrying the R112H and P60L mutations, without classical Fabry symptoms, showed no elevated plasma lysoGb3. Multiple regression analysis showed that there is no correlation of plasma lysoGb3 concentration with total disease severity score in Fabry males. However, plasma lysoGb3 concentration did correlate with white matter lesions (odds ratio: 6.1 per 100 nM lysoGb3 increase (95% CI: 1.4-25.9, p=0.015). In females, plasma lysoGb3 concentration correlated with overall disease severity. Furthermore, plasma lysoGb3 level was related to left ventricular mass (19.5+/-5.5 g increase per 10 nM lysoGb3 increase; p=0.001). In addition, it was assessed whether lifetime exposure to lysoGb3 correlates with disease manifestations. Male Fabry patients with a high lysoGb3 exposure (>10,000 U), were moderately or severely affected, only one mildly. Female patients with a low exposure (<1000 U) were asymptomatic or mildly affected. A large proportion of the females with an exposure >1000 U showed disease complications. Plasma lysoGb3 is useful for the diagnosis of Fabry disease. LysoGb3 is an independent risk factor for development of cerebrovascular white matter lesions in male patients and left ventricular hypertrophy in females. Disease severity correlates with exposure to plasma lysoGb3.	3 4
Phenotypic analysis of individuals with Costello syndrome due to HRAS p.G13C. ||  || Costello syndrome is characterized by severe failure-to-thrive, short stature, cardiac abnormalities (heart defects, tachyarrhythmia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)), distinctive facial features, a predisposition to papillomata and malignant tumors, postnatal cerebellar overgrowth resulting in Chiari 1 malformation, and cognitive disabilities. De novo germline mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS cause Costello syndrome. Most mutations affect the glycine residues in position 12 or 13, and more than 80% of patients share p.G12S. To test the hypothesis that subtle genotype-phenotype differences exist, we report the first cohort comparison between 12 Costello syndrome individuals with p.G13C and individuals with p.G12S. The individuals with p.G13C had many typical findings including polyhydramnios, failure-to-thrive, HCM, macrocephaly with posterior fossa crowding, and developmental delay. Subjectively, their facial features were less coarse. Statistically significant differences included the absence of multifocal atrial tachycardia (P-value = 0.033), ulnar deviation of the wrist (P < 0.001) and papillomata (P = 0.003), and fewer neurosurgical procedures (P = 0.024). Fewer individuals with p.G13C had short stature (height below -2 SD) without use of growth hormone (P < 0.001). The noteworthy absence of malignant tumors did not reach statistical significance. Novel ectodermal findings were noted in individuals with p.G13C, including loose anagen hair resulting in easily pluckable hair with a matted appearance, different from the tight curls typical for most Costello syndrome individuals. Unusually long eye lashes requiring trimming are a novel finding we termed dolichocilia. These distinctive ectodermal findings suggest a cell type specific effect of this particular mutation. Additional patients are needed to validate these findings.	4
Identification of an "Exceptional Responder" Cell Line to MEK1 Inhibition: Clinical Implications for MEK-Targeted Therapy. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival Computational Biology Drug Delivery Systems Humans Lung Neoplasms MAP Kinase Kinase 1 Mice Mutation Protein Kinase Inhibitors Pyridones Pyrimidinones RNA Interference Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || The identification of somatic genetic alterations that confer sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibitors has led to new cancer therapies. To identify mutations that confer an exceptional dependency, shRNA-based loss-of-function data were analyzed from a dataset of numerous cell lines to reveal genes that are essential in a small subset of cancer cell lines. Once these cell lines were determined, detailed genomic characterization from these cell lines was utilized to ascertain the genomic aberrations that led to this extreme dependency. This method, in a large subset of lung cancer cell lines, yielded a single lung adenocarcinoma cell line, NCI-H1437, which is sensitive to RNA interference of MAP2K1 expression. Notably, NCI-H1437 is the only lung cancer cell line included in the dataset with a known activating mutation in MAP2K1 (Q56P). Subsequent validation using shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 confirmed MAP2K1 dependency. In vitro and in vivo inhibitor studies established that NCI-H1437 cells are sensitive to MEK1 inhibitors, including the FDA-approved drug trametinib. Like NCI-H1437 cells, the MAP2K1-mutant cell lines SNU-C1 (colon) and OCUM-1 (gastric) showed decreased viability after MAP2K1 depletion via Cas9-mediated gene editing. Similarly, these cell lines were particularly sensitive to trametinib treatment compared with control cell lines. On the basis of these data, cancers that harbor driver mutations in MAP2K1 could benefit from treatment with MEK1 inhibitors. Furthermore, this functional data mining approach provides a general method to experimentally test genomic features that confer dependence in tumors. Cancers with an activated RAS/MAPK pathway driven by oncogenic MAP2K1 mutations may be particularly sensitive to MEK1 inhibitor treatments.	0
Nosology and classification of genetic skeletal disorders: 2010 revision. ||  || Genetic disorders involving the skeletal system arise through disturbances in the complex processes of skeletal development, growth and homeostasis and remain a diagnostic challenge because of their variety. The Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders provides an overview of recognized diagnostic entities and groups them by clinical and radiographic features and molecular pathogenesis. The aim is to provide the Genetics, Pediatrics and Radiology community with a list of recognized genetic skeletal disorders that can be of help in the diagnosis of individual cases, in the delineation of novel disorders, and in building bridges between clinicians and scientists interested in skeletal biology. In the 2010 revision, 456 conditions were included and placed in 40 groups defined by molecular, biochemical, and/or radiographic criteria. Of these conditions, 316 were associated with mutations in one or more of 226 different genes, ranging from common, recurrent mutations to "private" found in single families or individuals. Thus, the Nosology is a hybrid between a list of clinically defined disorders, waiting for molecular clarification, and an annotated database documenting the phenotypic spectrum produced by mutations in a given gene. The Nosology should be useful for the diagnosis of patients with genetic skeletal diseases, particularly in view of the information flood expected with the novel sequencing technologies; in the delineation of clinical entities and novel disorders, by providing an overview of established nosologic entities; and for scientists looking for the clinical correlates of genes, proteins and pathways involved in skeletal biology.	4
Molecular analysis of patients with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly (unilateral coronal synostosis). ||  || Mutations in genes known to be responsible for most of the recognizable syndromes associated with bilateral coronal synostosis can be detected by molecular testing. The genetic alterations that could cause unilateral coronal synostosis are more elusive. It is recognized that FGFR and TWIST mutations can give rise to either bilateral or unilateral coronal synostosis, even in the same family. The authors undertook a prospective study of patients presenting with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly (unilateral coronal synostosis) to Children's Hospital Boston during the period from 1997 to 2000. Mutational analysis was performed on all patients and on selected parents whenever familial transmission was suspected. Intraoperative anthropometry was used in an effort to differentiate those patients in whom a mutation was detected from those in whom it was not. The anthropometric measures included bilateral sagittal orbital-globe distance, inter medial canthal distance, and nasal angulation. Macrocephaly and palpebral angulation were also considered possible determinants. There was a 2:1 female preponderance in 47 patients with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly. Mutations were found in eight of 47 patients: two patients with different single-amino-acid changes in FGFR2, three patients with FGFR3 Pro250Arg, and three patients with TWIST mutations. Another patient had craniofrontonasal syndrome for which a causative locus has been mapped to chromosome X, although molecular testing is not yet available. Two features were strongly associated with a detectable mutation in patients with synostotic frontal plagiocephaly: asymmetrical brachycephaly (retrusion of both supraorbital rims) and orbital hypertelorism. Other abnormalities in the craniofacial region and extremities were clues to a particular mutation in FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST, or the X-linked mutation. Neither macrocephaly nor degree of nasal angulation nor relative vertical position of the lateral canthi correlated with mutational detection. An additional four patients in this study had either unilateral or bilateral coronal synostosis in an immediate relative and had anthropometric findings that predicted a mutation, and yet no genetic alteration was found. This suggests either that the authors' screening methods were not sufficiently sensitive or that perhaps there are other unknown pathogenic loci. Nevertheless, molecular testing is recommended for infants who have unilateral coronal synostosis, particularly if there are the anthropometric findings highlighted in this study or an otherwise suspicious feature in the child or a parent. Infants with either an identified or a suspected mutation usually need bilateral asymmetric advancement of the bandeau and may be more likely to require frontal revision in childhood.	4
αA-Crystallin associates with α6 integrin receptor complexes and regulates cellular signaling. || Animals Apoptosis Cadherins Cataract Cell Membrane Cell Survival Chick Embryo Epithelial Cells Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect Immunoblotting Immunoprecipitation Integrin alpha6 Lens, Crystalline MAP Kinase Kinase 4 Mice Mice, Knockout Quail Receptors, Laminin Signal Transduction Transfection alpha-Crystallin A Chain p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases || α-Crystallins are small heat-shock proteins important to lens transparency that provide the lens with its refractive properties. In their role as molecular chaperones, these crystallins also prevent protein aggregation, affect cytoskeletal remodeling, enhance resistance to cell stress, and provide lens cells with protection against apoptosis. While many of the functions assigned to αA-crystallin are attributable to its presence in the cytoplasm of lens cells, αA-crystallin also has been detected at the lens plasma membrane. However, how αA-crystallin becomes linked to the plasma membrane or what its functions are at this site has remained unknown. In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which αA-crystallin becomes associated with the lens membrane, focusing specifically on its interaction with membrane receptors, and the differentiation-specificity of these interactions. We also determined how the long-term absence of αA-crystallin alters receptor-linked signaling pathways. αA-crystallin association with membrane receptors was determined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis; its membrane localization was examined by confocal imaging; and the effect of αA-crystallin loss-of-function on the activation state of signaling molecules in pathways linked to membrane receptors was determined by immunoblot analysis. The results show that, in lens epithelial cells, plasma membrane αA-crystallin was primarily localized to apicolateral borders, reflecting the association of αA-crystallin with E-cadherin complexes. These studies also provide the first evidence that αA-crystallin maintained its association with the plasma membrane in lens cortical fiber cells, where it was localized to lateral interfaces, and further show that this association was mediated, in part, by αA-crystallin interaction with α6 integrin receptor complexes. We report that the absence of αA-crystallin led to constitutive activation of the stress kinases p38 and JNK, classical inducers of apoptotic cell death, and the loss of the phospho-Bad pro-survival signal, effects that were greatest in differentiating lens fiber cells. Concurrent with this, activation of FAK and ERK kinases was increased, demonstrating that these receptor-linked pathways also were dysregulated in the absence of αA-crystallin. These data link αA-crystallin plasma membrane association to its differentiation-state-specific interaction with E-cadherin and α6 integrin receptor complexes. The changes in cell signaling in αA-crystallin-null lenses suggest that dysregulation of receptor-linked cell-signaling pathways that accompany the failure of αA-crystallin to associate with membrane receptors may be responsible for the induction of apoptosis. The observed changes in lens cell signaling likely reflect long-term functional adaptations to the absence of the αA-crystallin chaperone/small heat-shock protein.	0
The Contrived Mutant p53 Oncogene - Beyond Loss of Functions. ||  || Mutations in p53 are almost synonymous with cancer - be it susceptibility to the disease or response to treatment - and therefore, are a critical determinant of overall survival. As most of these mutations occur in the DNA-binding domain of p53, many of the clinical correlations with mutant p53 have been initially relegated to the loss of its transcription-dependent activities as a tumor suppressor. However, significant efforts over the last two decades have led to the vast knowledge on the potential functions of the mutated p53 protein, which have been attributed to the physical presence of the mutant protein rather than the loss of its wild-type (WT) functions. Beyond the inhibitory effects of mutant p53 on the remaining WT protein that leads to the dominant-negative effect in the heterozygous state, mutant p53's presence has also been significantly attributed to novel gain-of-functions that lead to addiction of cancer cells to its presence for survival, as well as for their ability to invade and metastasize, elevating it to a contrived oncogene that drives the cancer cells forward.

We have previously reported that p53 protein, although a well-known tumor suppressor, can contribute to cancer cell survival and adaptation to low-glutamine conditions. However, the TP53 gene is frequently mutated in tumors, and the role of mutant p53 (mutp53) in response to metabolic stress remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-associated mutp53 promotes cancer cell survival upon glutamine deprivation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, cancer cells expressing mutp53 proteins are more resistant to glutamine deprivation than cells with wild-type p53. Depletion of endogenous mutp53 protein in human lymphoma cells leads to cell sensitivity to glutamine withdrawal, whereas expression of mutp53 in p53 null cells results in resistance to glutamine deprivation. Furthermore, we found that mutp53 proteins hyper-transactivate p53-target gene CDKN1A upon glutamine deprivation, thus triggering cell cycle arrest and promoting cell survival. Together, our results reveal an unidentified mechanism by which mutp53 confers oncogenic functions by promoting cancer cell adaptation to metabolic stress.	0
Addiction of lung cancer cells to GOF p53 is promoted by up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor through multiple contacts with p53 transactivation domain and promoter. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Cell Line, Tumor ErbB Receptors Humans Lung Neoplasms Mice Mice, Nude Mice, SCID Promoter Regions, Genetic Sp1 Transcription Factor Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Up-Regulation || Human lung cancers harboring gain-of-function (GOF) p53 alleles express higher levels of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We demonstrate that a number of GOF p53 alleles directly upregulate EGFR. Knock-down of p53 in lung cancer cells lowers EGFR expression and reduces tumorigenicity and other GOF p53 properties. However, addiction of lung cancer cells to GOF p53 can be compensated by overexpressing EGFR, suggesting that EGFR plays a critical role in addiction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using lung cancer cells expressing GOF p53 alleles showed that GOF p53 localized to the EGFR promoter. The sequence where GOF p53 is found to interact by ChIP seq can act as a GOF p53 response element. The presence of GOF p53 on the EGFR promoter increased histone H3 acetylation, indicating a mechanism whereby GOF p53 enhances chromatin opening for improved access to transcription factors (TFs). ChIP and ChIP-re-ChIP with p53, Sp1 and CBP histone acetylase (HAT) antibodies revealed docking of GOF p53 on Sp1, leading to increased binding of Sp1 and CBP to the EGFR promoter. Up-regulation of EGFR can occur via GOF p53 contact at other novel sites in the EGFR promoter even when TAD-I is inactivated; these sites are used by both intact and TAD-I mutated GOF p53 and might reflect redundancy in GOF p53 mechanisms for EGFR transactivation. Thus, the oncogenic action of GOF p53 in lung cancer is highly dependent on transactivation of the EGFR promoter via a novel transcriptional mechanism involving coordinated interactions of TFs, HATs and GOF p53.	0
Mechanistic validation of a clinical lead stapled peptide that reactivates p53 by dual HDM2 and HDMX targeting. || Antineoplastic Agents Bone Neoplasms Cell Line, Tumor Humans Nuclear Proteins Osteosarcoma Peptides, Cyclic Protein Binding Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Hydrocarbon-stapled peptides that display key residues of the p53 transactivation domain have emerged as bona fide clinical candidates for reactivating the tumor suppression function of p53 in cancer by dual targeting of the negative regulators HDM2 and HDMX. A recent study questioned the mechanistic specificity of such stapled peptides based on interrogating their capacity to disrupt p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX complexes in living cells using a new recombinase enhanced bimolecular luciferase complementation platform (ReBiL). Here, we directly evaluate the cellular uptake, intracellular targeting selectivity and p53-dependent cytotoxicity of the clinical prototype ATSP-7041. We find that under standard serum-containing tissue culture conditions, ATSP-7041 achieves intracellular access without membrane disruption, dose-dependently dissociates both p53/HDM2 and p53/HDMX complexes but not an unrelated protein complex in long-term ReBiL experiments, and is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells bearing wild-type p53 by inducing a surge in p53 protein level. These studies underscore the importance of a thorough stepwise approach, including consideration of the time-dependence of cellular uptake and intracellular distribution, in evaluating and advancing stapled peptides for clinical translation.	0
MSH2/BRCA1 expression as a DNA-repair signature predicting survival in early-stage lung cancer patients from the IFCT-0002 Phase 3 Trial. || Adult Aged BRCA1 Protein Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung DNA Methylation DNA Modification Methylases DNA Repair DNA Repair Enzymes Drug Therapy Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Ku Autoantigen Lung Neoplasms Male Middle Aged MutS Homolog 2 Protein Neoadjuvant Therapy Neoplasm Staging Prognosis Promoter Regions, Genetic Prospective Studies Survival Analysis Tumor Suppressor Proteins || DNA repair is a double-edged sword in lung carcinogenesis. When defective, it promotes genetic instability and accumulated genetic alterations. Conversely these defects could sensitize cancer cells to therapeutic agents inducing DNA breaks. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess MSH2, XRCC5, and BRCA1 expression in 443 post-chemotherapy specimens from patients randomized in a Phase 3 trial, comparing two neoadjuvant regimens in 528 Stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (IFCT-0002). O6MGMT promoter gene methylation was analyzed in a subset of 208 patients of the same trial with available snap-frozen specimens. Median follow-up was from 90 months onwards. Only high BRCA1 (n = 221, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.07-2.34], p = 0.02) and low MSH2 expression (n = 356, HR = 1.52, 95% CI [1.11-2.08], p = 0.008) significantly predicted better overall survival (OS) in univariate and multivariate analysis. A bootstrap re-sampling strategy distinguished three patient groups at high (n = 55, low BRCA1 and high MSH2, median OS >96 months, HR = 2.5, 95% CI [1.45-4.33], p = 0.001), intermediate (n = 82, median OS = 73.4 p = 0.0596), and low (high BRCA1 and low MSH2, n = 67, median OS = ND, HR = 0.51, 95% CI [0.31-0.83], p = 0.006) risk of death. DNA repair protein expression assessment identified three different groups of risk of death in early-stage lung cancer patients, according to their tumor MSH2 and BRCA1 expression levels. These results deserve prospective evaluation of MSH2/BRCA1 theranostic value in lung cancer patients treated with combinations of DNA-damaging chemotherapy and drugs targeting DNA repair, such as Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.	4
The infantile-onset form of Pompe disease: an autopsy diagnosis. ||  || Pompe disease (PD) is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme described in 1932 by the Dutch pathologist Joannes Cassianus Pompe. The prevalence of PD ranges from 1:40,000 to 1:300,000 births and depends on geographic and ethnic factors. Clinical manifestations may vary from a rapidly progressive disabling disease with cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, weakness, generalized hypotonia, and death within the first year of life, to a mild presentation characterized by slowly progressive myopathy predominantly involving the skeletal muscles. The laboratory diagnostic gold standard is represented by the determination of the alpha-glucosidase activity. However, the muscle histology may also yield the diagnosis by evaluating the tissular glycogen accumulation. Until recently, supportive measures constituted the unique available therapy. Currently, the administration of the recombinant GAA is being used with promising results. The authors present the case of a 5-month-old boy, previously diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy since the age of 2 months, who presented acute heart failure accompanied by biventricular dilation followed by refractory shock and death. The autopsy findings confirmed the glycogen-accumulation disease.	1
Germline and somatic mosaicism for FGFR2 mutation in the mother of a child with Crouzon syndrome: Implications for genetic testing in "paternal age-effect" syndromes. || Adult Child Craniofacial Dysostosis Craniosynostoses DNA Female Genetic Testing Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Mosaicism Mothers Paternal Age Pedigree Polymerase Chain Reaction Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 Syndrome || Crouzon syndrome is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by craniosynostosis and facial dysostosis, caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene; it belongs to a class of disorders that mostly arise as de novo mutations and exhibit a near-exclusive paternal origin of mutation and elevated paternal age ("paternal age effect"). However, even if this is the major mode of origin of mutations in paternal age-effect disorders, germline mosaicism may also occur. Here we describe the first molecularly documented evidence of germline and somatic mosaicism for FGFR2 mutation, identified in the mother of a child with Crouzon syndrome caused by a heterozygous c.1007A>G (p.Asp336Gly) substitution. Levels of maternal somatic mosaicism for this mutation, estimated by pyrosequencing, ranged from 3.3% in hair roots to 14.1% in blood. Our observation underlines the importance of parental molecular testing for accurate genetic counseling of the risk of recurrence for Crouzon, and other paternal age-effect syndromes.	4
SF3B1 and BAP1 mutations in blue nevus-like melanoma. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Diagnosis, Differential GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11 Humans Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Nevus, Blue Phosphoproteins RNA Splicing Factors Skin Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Proteins Ubiquitin Thiolesterase Young Adult || Blue nevi are melanocytic tumors originating in the cutaneous dermis. Malignant tumors may arise in association with or resembling blue nevi, so called 'blue nevus-like melanoma', which can metastasize and result in patient death. Identifying which tumors will behave in a clinically aggressive manner can be challenging. Identifying genetic alterations in such tumors may assist in their diagnosis and prognostication. Blue nevi are known to be genetically related to uveal melanomas (eg, both harboring GNAQ and GNA11 mutations). In this study, we analyzed a large cohort (n=301) of various morphologic variants of blue nevi and related tumors including tumors diagnosed as atypical blue nevi (n=21), and blue nevus-like melanoma (n=12), screening for all gene mutations known to occur in uveal melanoma. Similar to published reports, we found the majority of blue nevi harbored activating mutations in GNAQ (53%) or GNA11 (15%). In addition, rare CYSLTR2 (1%) and PLCB4 (1%) mutations were identified. EIF1AX, SF3B1, and BAP1 mutations were also detected, with BAP1 and SF3B1 R625 mutations being present only in clearly malignant tumors (17% (n=2) and 25% (n=3) of blue nevus-like melanoma, respectively). In sequencing data from a larger cohort of cutaneous melanomas, this genetic profile was also identified in tumors not originally diagnosed as blue nevus-like melanoma. Our findings suggest that the genetic profile of coexistent GNAQ or GNA11 mutations with BAP1 or SF3B1 mutations can aid the histopathological diagnosis of blue nevus-like melanoma and distinguish blue nevus-like melanoma from conventional epidermal-derived melanomas. Future studies will need to further elucidate the prognostic implications and appropriate clinical management for patients with tumors harboring these mutation profiles.	4
Heterodimerization of AML1/ETO with CBFβ is required for leukemogenesis but not for myeloproliferation. || Animals Cell Differentiation Cell Line Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit Core Binding Factor beta Subunit Dimerization Humans Leukemia Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Oncogene Proteins, Fusion RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein || The AML1/Runx1 transcription factor and its heterodimerization partner CBFβ are essential regulators of myeloid differentiation. The chromosomal translocation t(8;21), fusing the DNA binding domain of AML1 to the corepressor eight-twenty-one (ETO), is frequently associated with acute myeloid leukemia and generates the AML1/ETO (AE) fusion protein. AE represses target genes usually activated by AML1 and also affects the endogenous repressive function of ETO at Notch target genes. In order to analyze the contribution of CBFβ in AE-mediated leukemogenesis and deregulation of Notch target genes, we introduced two point mutations in a leukemia-initiating version of AE in mice, called AE9a, that disrupt the AML1/CBFβ interaction (AE9aNT). We report that the AE9a/CBFβ interaction is not required for the AE9a-mediated aberrant expression of AML1 target genes, while upregulation/derepression of Notch target genes does require the interaction with CBFβ. Using retroviral transduction to express AE9a in murine adult bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors, we observed that both AE9a and AE9aNT lead to increased myeloproliferation in vivo. However, both development of leukemia and long-term replating capacity are only observed with AE9a but not with AE9aNT. Thus, deregulation of both AML1 and Notch target genes is required for the development of AE9a-driven leukemia.	0
Prevalence of Rare Genetic Variations and Their Implications in NGS-data Interpretation. ||  || Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has improved enough to discover mutations associated with genetic diseases. Our study evaluated the feasibility of targeted NGS as a primary screening tool to detect causal variants and subsequently predict genetic diseases. We performed parallel computations on 3.7-megabase-targeted regions to detect disease-causing mutations in 103 participants consisting of 81 patients and 22 controls. Data analysis of the participants took about 6 hours using local databases and 200 nodes of a supercomputer. All variants in the selected genes led on average to 3.6 putative diseases for each patient while variants restricted to disease-causing genes identified the correct disease. Notably, only 12% of predicted causal variants were recorded as causal mutations in public databases: 88% had no or insufficient records. In this study, most genetic diseases were caused by rare mutations and public records were inadequate. Most rare variants, however, were not associated with genetic diseases. These data implied that novel, rare variants should not be ignored but interpreted in conjunction with additional clinical data. This step is needed so appropriate advice can be given to primary doctors and parents, thus fulfilling the purpose of this method as a primary screen for rare genetic diseases.	4
[Mutation of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in the population of central Bohemia. Relation to the clinical picture of phenylketonuria]. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive, disease, heterogeneous at the molecular level, caused by mutations in the gene of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The objective of the present work was to identify mutations and their frequency in the Central Bohemian and Prague population in relation to the clinical phenotype. The authors analyzed a group of 33 patients from 32 unrelated families. The phenotypic manifestations were classified as non-PKU hyperphenylalaninaemia (non-PKU-HPA), mild and classical PKU. Sixty-six mutant alleles of the PAH gene were analyzed by means of the polymerase chain reaction on a Perkin Elmer (480) apparatus and on PHC Techne. A total of eight mutations linked with five haplotypes were detected. R408W mutation linked with 2.4 haplotype was detected on 53% of mutant alleles. No type of mutation was detected by hitherto published procedures in 27% of mutant alleles. The finding on the distribution and frequency of mutations indicate a genotypic homogeneity of the PKU population in the Central Bohemian area and Prague and are consistent with hitherto published data from the Czech Republic. The revealed data can be used in prenatal and postnatal DNA diagnosis and genotype classification of PKU.	1 3
Molecular genetic analysis of TWIST1 and FGFR3 genes in Korean patients with coronal synostosis: identification of three novel TWIST1 mutations. || Acrocephalosyndactylia Child Child, Preschool Craniosynostoses Female Genetic Testing Humans Infant Korea Male Mutation Nuclear Proteins Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Twist-Related Protein 1 || Craniosynostosis is very heterogeneous in terms of its causes, presentation, and management. In particular, coronal synostosis evidences a higher tendency to be genetically caused, and TWIST1 and FGFR3 have been identified as major causative genes. The authors analyzed the clinical and molecular characteristics of Korean patients with coronal synostosis in this study. Forty-three Korean patients with unicoronal or bicoronal synostosis were included in this study. All samples were first screened for TWIST1 and FGFR3 mutation hot spots, and the negative samples were subsequently screened for FGFR2. The patients' clinical features were analyzed and compared. Seven sequence alterations (six in TWIST1 and one in FGFR3) were identified in 11 patients (25.6 percent). Three novel TWIST1 mutations were detected, and p.P250R was the only mutation in FGFR3. Bicoronal cases evidenced a much higher mutation detection rate (52.9 percent) than unicoronal cases (7.7 percent). In the TWIST1 group, five patients had Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, and one was nonsyndromic. In the FGFR3 group, four patients had Muenke syndrome, and one was nonsyndromic. The majority of associated anomalies, with the exception of psychomotor retardation and Chiari malformation, were detected more frequently in TWIST1 patients than in FGFR3 p.P250R patients. This study is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to illustrate the frequency and spectrum of mutations in TWIST1 and FGFR3 in Korea. Considering that molecular diagnosis techniques can prove helpful in providing adequate genetic counseling and guidance, genetic screening for TWIST1 and FGFR3 p.P250R in cases of coronal synostosis is recommended.	4
Extensive and coordinated transcription of noncoding RNAs within cell-cycle promoters. || Apoptosis Biomarkers Cell Cycle Cell Differentiation Chromatin Immunoprecipitation DNA Damage Gene Expression Profiling Genes, cdc Humans Immunoprecipitation Molecular Sequence Data Neoplasms Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Promoter Regions, Genetic RNA, Messenger RNA, Untranslated Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation || Transcription of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within gene regulatory elements can modulate gene activity in response to external stimuli, but the scope and functions of such activity are not known. Here we use an ultrahigh-density array that tiles the promoters of 56 cell-cycle genes to interrogate 108 samples representing diverse perturbations. We identify 216 transcribed regions that encode putative lncRNAs, many with RT-PCR-validated periodic expression during the cell cycle, show altered expression in human cancers and are regulated in expression by specific oncogenic stimuli, stem cell differentiation or DNA damage. DNA damage induces five lncRNAs from the CDKN1A promoter, and one such lncRNA, named PANDA, is induced in a p53-dependent manner. PANDA interacts with the transcription factor NF-YA to limit expression of pro-apoptotic genes; PANDA depletion markedly sensitized human fibroblasts to apoptosis by doxorubicin. These findings suggest potentially widespread roles for promoter lncRNAs in cell-growth control.	0
The Role of Cdkn1A-Interacting Zinc Finger Protein 1 (CIZ1) in DNA Replication and Pathophysiology. || Alternative Splicing Animals Cell Cycle Cell Differentiation Cell Proliferation DNA Replication Disease Susceptibility Gene Expression Regulation Humans Nuclear Proteins Protein Conformation || Cdkn1A-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (CIZ1) was first identified in a yeast-2-hybrid system searching for interacting proteins of CDK2 inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1). Ciz1 also binds to CDK2, cyclin A, cyclin E, CDC6, PCNA, TCF4 and estrogen receptor-α. Recent studies reveal numerous biological functions of CIZ1 in DNA replication, cell proliferation, and differentiation. In addition, splicing variants of CIZ1 mRNA is associated with a variety of cancers and Alzheimer's disease, and mutations of the CIZ1 gene lead to cervical dystonia. CIZ1 expression is increased in cancers and rheumatoid arthritis. In this review, we will summarize the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of CIZ1 in these physiological and pathological processes.	0
Dies1/VISTA expression loss is a recurrent event in gastric cancer due to epigenetic regulation. || B7 Antigens Cell Line, Tumor DNA Methylation Down-Regulation Epigenesis, Genetic Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2 Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins Neoplasm Proteins Promoter Regions, Genetic Stomach Neoplasms Transforming Growth Factor beta1 Tumor Microenvironment || Dies1/VISTA induces embryonic stem-cell differentiation, via BMP-pathway, but also acts as inflammation regulator and immune-response modulator. Dies1 inhibition in a melanoma-mouse model led to increased tumour-infiltrating T-cells and decreased tumour growth, emphasizing Dies1 relevance in tumour-microenvironment. Dies1 is involved in cell de/differentiation, inflammation and cancer processes, which mimic those associated with Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). Despite this axis linking Dies1 with EMT and cancer, its expression, modulation and relevance in these contexts is unknown. To address this, we analysed Dies1 expression, its regulation by promoter-methylation and miR-125a-5p overexpression, and its association with BMP-pathway downstream-effectors, in a TGFβ1-induced EMT-model, cancer cell-lines and primary samples. We detected promoter-methylation as a mechanism controlling Dies1 expression in our EMT-model and in several cancer cell-lines. We showed that the relationship between Dies1 expression and BMP-pathway effectors observed in the EMT-model, was not present in all cell-lines, suggesting that Dies1 has other cell-specific effectors, beyond the BMP-pathway. We further demonstrated that: Dies1 expression loss is a recurrent event in GC, caused by promoter methylation and/or miR-125a-5p overexpression and; GC-microenvironment myofibroblasts overexpress Dies1. Our findings highlight Dies1 as a novel player in GC, with distinct roles within tumour cells and in the tumour-microenvironment.	0
Unravelling mechanisms of p53-mediated tumour suppression. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Cycle Checkpoints Cellular Senescence DNA Damage Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Mice Neoplasm Invasiveness Neoplasm Metastasis Neoplasms Signal Transduction Stem Cells Transcription, Genetic Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 is a crucial tumour suppressor that responds to diverse stress signals by orchestrating specific cellular responses, including transient cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence and apoptosis, which are all processes associated with tumour suppression. However, recent studies have challenged the relative importance of these canonical cellular responses for p53-mediated tumour suppression and have highlighted roles for p53 in modulating other cellular processes, including metabolism, stem cell maintenance, invasion and metastasis, as well as communication within the tumour microenvironment. In this Opinion article, we discuss the roles of classical p53 functions, as well as emerging p53-regulated processes, in tumour suppression.	0
Association between idiopathic hearing loss and mitochondrial DNA mutations: a study on 169 hearing-impaired subjects. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aminoglycosides Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA, Mitochondrial Female Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Mutation Nucleic Acid Conformation Phenotype Polymorphism, Genetic RNA, Ribosomal Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been shown to be an important cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). In this study, we performed a clinical and genetic analysis of 169 hearing-impaired patients and some of their relatives suffering from idiopathic SNHL, both familial and sporadic. The analysis of four fragments of their mtDNA identified several polymorphisms, the well known pathogenic mutation, A1555G, and some novel mutations in different genes, implying changes in the aminoacidic sequence. A novel sporadic mutation in 12S rRNA (MT-RNR1), not previously reported in the literature, was found in a case of possible aminoglycoside-induced progressive deafness.	4
Molecular determinants of ATP-sensitive potassium channel MgATPase activity: diabetes risk variants and diazoxide sensitivity. || Amino Acid Substitution Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Diazoxide HEK293 Cells Humans Mutation, Missense Sulfonylurea Receptors || ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channels play an important role in insulin secretion. KATP channels possess intrinsic MgATPase activity that is important in regulating channel activity in response to metabolic changes, although the precise structural determinants are not clearly understood. Furthermore, the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) S1369A diabetes risk variant increases MgATPase activity, but the molecular mechanisms remain to be determined. Therefore, we hypothesized that residue-residue interactions between 1369 and 1372, predicted from in silico modelling, influence MgATPase activity, as well as sensitivity to the clinically used drug diazoxide that is known to increase MgATPase activity. We employed a point mutagenic approach with patch-clamp and direct biochemical assays to determine interaction between residues 1369 and 1372. Mutations in residues 1369 and 1372 predicted to decrease the residue interaction elicited a significant increase in MgATPase activity, whereas mutations predicted to possess similar residue interactions to wild-type (WT) channels elicited no alterations in MgATPase activity. In contrast, mutations that were predicted to increase residue interactions resulted in significant decreases in MgATPase activity. We also determined that a single S1369K substitution in SUR1 caused MgATPase activity and diazoxide pharmacological profiles to resemble those of channels containing the SUR2A subunit isoform. Our results provide evidence, at the single residue level, for a molecular mechanism that may underlie the association of the S1369A variant with type 2 diabetes. We also show a single amino acid difference can account for the markedly different diazoxide sensitivities between channels containing either the SUR1 or SUR2A subunit isoforms.	0
Molecular Mechanism for Conformational Dynamics of Ras·GTP Elucidated from In-Situ Structural Transition in Crystal. ||  || Ras•GTP adopts two interconverting conformational states, state 1 and state 2, corresponding to inactive and active forms, respectively. However, analysis of the mechanism for state transition was hampered by the lack of the structural information on wild-type Ras state 1 despite its fundamental nature conserved in the Ras superfamily. Here we solve two new crystal structures of wild-type H-Ras, corresponding to state 1 and state 2. The state 2 structure seems to represent an intermediate of state transition and, intriguingly, the state 1 crystal is successfully derived from this state 2 crystal by regulating the surrounding humidity. Structural comparison enables us to infer the molecular mechanism for state transition, during which a wide range of hydrogen-bonding networks across Switch I, Switch II and the α3-helix interdependently undergo gross rearrangements, where fluctuation of Tyr32, translocation of Gln61, loss of the functional water molecules and positional shift of GTP play major roles. The NMR-based hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments also support this transition mechanism. Moreover, the unveiled structural features together with the results of the biochemical study provide a new insight into the physiological role of state 1 as a stable pool of Ras•GTP in the GDP/GTP cycle of Ras.	0
[The spectrum of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in the Russian population]. || Amino Acid Substitution European Continental Ancestry Group Exons Female Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetics, Population Humans Hypercholesterolemia Male Mutation, Missense Receptors, LDL Russia || The spectrum of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene was studied in a sample of hypercholesterolemia patients of Caucasoid origin from the population of Russia. The examined patients were 45 to 49-years-old and had the highest level of total serum cholesterol in this age group. Seven previously non-described mutations have been revealed in exon 9 (R410G; M412V) and in exon 12 (Y/Y576; N/N591; L605V; L605R; A612G). Twelve previously described mutations have been identified in exons 2 (C/C27), 5 (C261F; E240X), 6 (E288K), 8 (A391T), 9 (E418G; L432R; D433E), 11 (G/G549; E558K; L/L568), and 12 (G592E). Only one of these mutations was previously described in Russia in a clinical sample of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The spectrum of LDL receptor gene mutations in the population sample of patients with hypercholesterolemia significantly differs from the mutation spectrum in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (clinical samples). Sequencing of the LDL receptor gene is a highly efficient method for identifying the markers of hypercholesterolemia predisposition in a population.	4
Treatment of terminal peritoneal carcinomatosis by a transducible p53-activating peptide. || Antineoplastic Agents Cell Division Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Genes, p53 Genetic Therapy Humans Peptides Peritoneal Neoplasms Protein Processing, Post-Translational Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Advanced-stage peritoneal carcinomatosis is resistant to current chemotherapy treatment and, in the case of metastatic ovarian cancer, results in a devastating 15%-20% survival rate. Therapeutics that restore genes inactivated during oncogenesis are predicted to be more potent and specific than current therapies. Experiments with viral vectors have demonstrated the theoretical utility of expressing the p53 tumor suppressor gene in cancer cells. However, clinically useful alternative approaches for introducing p53 activity into cancer cells are clearly needed. It has been hypothesized that direct reactivation of endogenous p53 protein in cancer cells will be therapeutically beneficial, but few tests of this hypothesis have been carried out in vivo. We report that a transducible D-isomer RI-TATp53C' peptide activates the p53 protein in cancer cells, but not normal cells. RI-TATp53C' peptide treatment of preclinical terminal peritoneal carcinomatosis and peritoneal lymphoma models results in significant increases in lifespan (greater than 6-fold) and the generation of disease-free animals. These proof-of-concept observations show that specific activation of endogenous p53 activity by a macromolecular agent is therapeutically effective in preclinical models of terminal human malignancy. Our results suggest that TAT-mediated transduction may be a useful strategy for the therapeutic delivery of large tumor suppressor molecules to malignant cells in vivo.	0
Structural effects of the L145Q, V157F, and R282W cancer-associated mutations in the p53 DNA-binding core domain. || Binding Sites Crystallography, X-Ray DNA Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Dynamics Simulation Mutation Neoplasms Protein Conformation Structure-Activity Relationship Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor involved in many important signaling pathways, such as apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. In over half of human cancers, p53 function is compromised by a mutation in its gene. Mutations in the p53 DNA-binding core domain destabilize the structure and reduce DNA-binding activity. We performed molecular dynamics simulations at physiological temperature to study the structural and dynamic effects of the L145Q, V157F, and R282W cancer-associated mutations in comparison to the wild-type protein. While there were common regions of destabilization in the mutant simulations, structural changes particular to individual mutations were also observed. Significant backbone deviations of the H2 helix and S7-S8 loop were observed in all mutant simulations; the H2 helix binds to DNA. In addition, the L145Q and V157F mutations, which are located in the β-sandwich core of the domain, disrupted the β-sheet structure and the loop-sheet-helix motif. The R282W mutation caused distortion of the loop-sheet-helix motif, but otherwise this mutant was similar to the wild-type structure. The introduction of these mutations caused rearrangement of the DNA-binding surface, consistent with their reduced DNA-binding activity. The simulations reveal detailed effects of the mutations on the stability and dynamics of p53 that may provide insight for therapeutic approaches.	0
Association between Mutation and Expression of TP53 as a Potential Prognostic Marker of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Disease-Free Survival Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Neoplasm Staging Prognosis RNA, Messenger Sequence Deletion Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || TP53, the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer, is more frequently altered in HER2-enriched and basal-like breast cancer. However, no studies have clarified the role ofTP53 status as a prognostic and predictive marker of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We performed p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC), nCounter mRNA expression assay, and DNA sequencing to determine the relationship between TP53 alteration and clinical outcomes of TNBC patients. Seventy-seven of 174 TNBC patients were found to harbor a TP53 mutation. Patients with missense mutations showed high protein expression in contrast to patients with deletion mutations (positivity of IHC: wild type vs. missense vs. deletion mutation, 53.6% vs. 89.8% vs. 25.0%, respectively; p < 0.001).TP53 mRNA expression was influenced by mutation status (mRNA expression [median]: wild type vs. missense vs. deletion mutation, 207.36± 132.73 vs. 339.61±143.21 vs. 99.53±99.57, respectively; p < 0.001). According to survival analysis, neither class of mutation nor protein or mRNA expression status had any impact on patient prognosis. In subgroup analysis, low mRNA expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with aTP53 missense mutation (5-year distant recurrence-free survival [5Y DRFS]: low vs. high, 50.0% vs. 87.8%; p=0.009), while high mRNA expression with aTP53 deletion mutation indicated poor prognosis (5Y DRFS: low vs. high, 91.7% vs. 75.0%; p=0.316). Association between TP53 mutation and expression indicates a potential prognostic marker of TNBC; hence both DNA sequencing and mRNA expression analysis may be required to predict the prognosis of TNBC patients.	4
The genomic landscape of pediatric myelodysplastic syndromes. || Adult Animals Cell Line Child Cohort Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genomics HEK293 Cells Humans Loss of Heterozygosity Mice Mutation Myelodysplastic Syndromes Proteins Survival Analysis Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are uncommon in children and have a poor prognosis. In contrast to adult MDS, little is known about the genomic landscape of pediatric MDS. Here, we describe the somatic and germline changes of pediatric MDS using whole exome sequencing, targeted amplicon sequencing, and/or RNA-sequencing of 46 pediatric primary MDS patients. Our data show that, in contrast to adult MDS, Ras/MAPK pathway mutations are common in pediatric MDS (45% of primary cohort), while mutations in RNA splicing genes are rare (2% of primary cohort). Surprisingly, germline variants in SAMD9 or SAMD9L were present in 17% of primary MDS patients, and these variants were routinely lost in the tumor cells by chromosomal deletions (e.g., monosomy 7) or copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH). Our data confirm that adult and pediatric MDS are separate diseases with disparate mechanisms, and that SAMD9/SAMD9L mutations represent a new class of MDS predisposition.	0
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) aberrations in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Transitional Cell DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Neoplasm Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Invasiveness Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Urinary Bladder Neoplasms || Recent studies suggest that FGFR3 is a potential therapeutic target in urothelial carcinoma (UC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rates and types of FGFR3 aberrations in patients with muscle-invasive UC who received radical resection. We analyzed surgical tumor samples from 74 UC patients who had received radical cystectomy (n = 40) or ureteronephrectomy (n = 34). Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 and nCounter Copy Number Variation Assay were used to detect FGFR3 aberrations. Fifty-four patients (73%) had high-grade tumors, and 62% had lymph node involvement. Sixteen patients (22%) harbored FGFR3 alterations, the most common of which was FGFR3 mutations (n = 13): Y373C (n = 3), N532D (n = 3), R248C (n = 2), S249C (n = 1), G370C (n = 1), S657S (n = 1), A797P (n = 1), and 746_747insG (n = 1). Three additional patients had a FGFR3-TACC3 rearrangement. The frequency of FGFR3 aberrations was higher in bladder UC (25%) than in UC of the renal pelvis and ureter (18%) but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.444). Genes that were co-aberrant with FGFR3 included APC (88%), PDGFRA (81%), RET (69%), and TP53 (69%). We report the frequency and types of FGFR3 aberrations in Korean patients with UC. Patients with FGFR3 mutations or FGFR3-TACC3 fusion may constitute potential candidates for a novel FGFR-targeted therapy in the perioperative setting.	4
Ligand dependent restoration of human TLR3 signaling and death in p53 mutant cells. || Animals Apoptosis Cell Line, Tumor Cell Proliferation DNA Damage Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Humans Immunity, Innate Mice Mutation Plasmids Signal Transduction Toll-Like Receptor 3 Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Diversity within the p53 transcriptional network can arise from a matrix of changes that include target response element sequences and p53 expression level variations. We previously found that wild type p53 (WT p53) can regulate expression of most innate immune-related Toll-like-receptor genes (TLRs) in human cells, thereby affecting immune responses. Since many tumor-associated p53 mutants exhibit change-of-spectrum transactivation from various p53 targets, we examined the ability of twenty-five p53 mutants to activate endogenous expression of the TLR gene family in p53 null human cancer cell lines following transfection with p53 mutant expression vectors. While many mutants retained the ability to drive TLR expression at WT levels, others exhibited null, limited, or change-of-spectrum transactivation of TLR genes. Using TLR3 signaling as a model, we show that some cancer-associated p53 mutants amplify cytokine, chemokine and apoptotic responses after stimulation by the cognate ligand poly(I:C). Furthermore, restoration of WT p53 activity for loss-of-function p53 mutants by the p53 reactivating drug RITA restored p53 regulation of TLR3 gene expression and enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis via TLR3 signaling. Overall, our findings have many implications for understanding the impact of WT and mutant p53 in immunological responses and cancer therapy.	0
Comparing the frequency of common genetic variants and haplotypes between carriers and non-carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations in Australian women diagnosed with breast cancer before 40 years of age. || Adolescent Adult Australia BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Case-Control Studies Female Founder Effect Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Haplotypes Humans Middle Aged Neoplasm Staging Polymorphism, Genetic Prognosis Risk Factors Survival Rate Young Adult || BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are found in a proportion of families with multiple early-onset breast cancers. There are a large number of different deleterious mutations in both genes, none of which would be detectable using standard genetic association studies. Single common variants and haplotypes of common variants may capture groups of deleterious mutations since some low prevalence haplotypes of common variants occur more frequently among chromosomes that carry rare, deleterious mutations than chromosomes that do not. DNA sequence data for BRCA1 and BRCA2 was obtained from 571 participants from the Australian Breast Cancer Family Study. Genetic variants were classified as either deleterious mutations or common genetic variants. Variants tagging common polymorphisms were selected and haplotypes resolved using Haploview. Their frequency was compared to those with and without deleterious mutations using a permutation test. A common genetic variant in BRCA1 (3232A > G) was found to be over-represented in deleterious mutation carriers (p = 0.05), whereas a common genetic variant in BRCA2 (1342A > C) occurred less frequently in deleterious mutation carriers (p = 0.04). All four of the common BRCA1 variants used to form haplotypes occurred more frequently in the deleterious mutation carriers when compared to the non-carriers, but there was no evidence of a difference in the distributions between the two groups (p = 0.34). In BRCA2, all four common variants were found to occur less frequently in the deleterious mutation carriers when compared to non-carriers, but the evidence for difference in the distribution between the two groups was weak (p = 0.16). Several less common haplotypes of common BRCA1 variants were found to be over-represented among deleterious mutation carriers but there was no evidence for this at the population level. In BRCA2, only the most common haplotype was found to occur more frequently in deleterious mutation carriers, with again no evidence at the population level. We observed differences in the frequency of common genetic variants of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 and their haplotypes between early-onset breast cancer cases who did and did not carry deleterious mutations in these genes. Although our data provide only weak evidence for a difference in frequencies at the population level, the number of deleterious mutation carriers was low and the results may yet be substantiated in a larger study using pooled data.	4
A Rare Missense Mutation and a Polymorphism with High Frequency in <i>LDLR</i> Gene among Iranian Patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia. || Familial hypercholesterolemia Iran high-resolution melting low-density lipoprotein receptor missense mutation || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a disorder that is inherited by autosomal dominant pattern. The main cause of FH disease is the occurrence of mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene sequence, as well as apolipoprotein B and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes, located in the next ranks, respectively. Forty-five unrelated Iranian patients with FH were screened using a high-resolution melting (HRM) method for exon 9 along with intron/exon boundaries of <i>LDLR</i> gene. Samples with shift in resultant HRM curves were compared to normal ones, sequenced, and analyzed. Our findings revealed a missense mutation c. 1246C>T and a known variant IVS9-30C>T (rs1003723) that was recognized in 71% of the patients (22%: homozygous and 49%: heterozygous genotypes). <i>In silico</i> analysis, predicted the pathological effect of the c. 1246C>T mutation in LDLR protein structure, but IVS9-30C>T variant had no predicted effect on splice site and branch point function. FH is a hereditary type of hypercholesterolemia that leads to premature cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis, and early diagnosis is needed. We detected a rare missense mutation (1246C>T) and a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Iranian population. These reports could help in the genetic diagnosis and counseling of FH patients.	4
Cross-sectional analysis of hearing threshold in relation to age in a large family with cochleovestibular impairment thoroughly genotyped for DFNA9/COCH. || Adult Age Factors Audiometry Auditory Threshold Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14 Cochlear Diseases Deafness Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Proteins Regression Analysis Vestibular Diseases || Hearing threshold was analyzed for each frequency in relation to age in 88 members of a large Dutch family with cochleovestibular impairment caused by a P51S mutation in the COCH gene within the DFNA9 locus (chromosome 14q12-13). The participants in this study were 34 mutation carriers and 54 relatives without the mutation (control subjects). A sigmoidal dose-response curve with a variable slope was used to fit the mutation carriers' threshold-on-age data. Progression started at about 40 years of age and only lasted for some 20 to 25 years; the associated average progression was 2.9 dB/y for all frequencies. However, some hearing impairment was already present before, predominantly at the high frequencies. The mean thresholds in the young mutation carriers (< 33 years of age) were significantly higher (by 4 to 13 dB) than those in age-matched controls at 2 to 8 kHz. Presumably, mutation carriers have a congenital, stable offset threshold (10 to 29 dB) at these frequencies, and develop progression later in life.	4
Anticancer effects of CKD-602 (Camtobell®) via G2/M phase arrest in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. ||  || CKD-602 (7-[2-(N-isopropylamino) ethyl]-(20S)-camptothecin, belotecan) is a synthetic water-soluble camptothecin derivative and topoisomerase I inhibitor that has been shown to exert a clinical anticancer effect on various types of tumor. In the present study, the anticancer effects of CKD-602 on the following three human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines originating from Korean cancer patients: YD-8 (tongue), YD-9 (buccal mucosa) and YD-38 (lower gingiva) were analyzed. The apoptotic proportion of the cells and cell cycle position were analyzed using flow cytometry. The expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins was detected by western blot analysis. CKD-602 was demonstrated to exert a time- and dose-dependent antiproliferative effect in all cell lines in vitro, however, susceptibility to CKD-602 at 72 h following treatment varied among the three cell lines, with 50% inhibition of cell viability at concentrations of 2.4 μg/ml for YD-8, 0.18 μg/ml for YD-9 and 0.05 μg/ml for YD-38. To investigate the underlying mechanism of the CKD-602 antiproliferative effect, a cell cycle-analysis was conducted in the three OSCC cell lines and CKD-602 treatment was observed to induce G2/M phase arrest. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of phospho-cdc2 (Tyr 15), cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 were increased in a time-dependent manner, following the administration of CKD-602. In the fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, the number of apoptotic cells was also increased in a dose-dependent manner following CKD-602 treatment of the OSCC cell lines. The results suggest that CKD-602 may inhibit the proliferation of OSCC oral cancer cells derived from samples from Korean patients by apoptosis and by G2/M phase arrest.	0
Evaluating Clinical Genome Sequence Analysis by Watson for Genomics. ||  || Background: Oncologists increasingly rely on clinical genome sequencing to pursue effective, molecularly targeted therapies. This study assesses the validity and utility of the artificial intelligence Watson for Genomics (WfG) for analyzing clinical sequencing results.Methods: This study identified patients with solid tumors who participated in in-house genome sequencing projects at a single cancer specialty hospital between April 2013 and October 2016. Targeted genome sequencing results of these patients' tumors, previously analyzed by multidisciplinary specialists at the hospital, were reanalyzed by WfG. This study measures the concordance between the two evaluations.Results: In 198 patients, in-house genome sequencing detected 785 gene mutations, 40 amplifications, and 22 fusions after eliminating single nucleotide polymorphisms. Breast cancer (n = 40) was the most frequent diagnosis in this analysis, followed by gastric cancer (n = 31), and lung cancer (n = 30). Frequently detected single nucleotide variants were found inTP53 (n = 107),BRCA2 (n = 24), andNOTCH2 (n = 23).MYC (n = 10) was the most frequently detected gene amplification, followed byERBB2 (n = 9) andCCND1 (n = 6). Concordant pathogenic classifications (i.e., pathogenic, benign, or variant of unknown significance) between in-house specialists and WfG included 705 mutations (89.8%; 95% CI, 87.5%-91.8%), 39 amplifications (97.5%; 95% CI, 86.8-99.9%), and 17 fusions (77.3%; 95% CI, 54.6-92.2%). After about 12 months, reanalysis using a more recent version of WfG demonstrated a better concordance rate of 94.5% (95% CI, 92.7-96.0%) for gene mutations. Across the 249 gene alterations determined to be pathogenic by both methods, including mutations, amplifications, and fusions, WfG covered 84.6% (88 of 104) of all targeted therapies that experts proposed and offered an additional 225 therapeutic options.Conclusions: WfG was able to scour large volumes of data from scientific studies and databases to analyze in-house clinical genome sequencing results and demonstrated the potential for application to clinical practice; however, we must train WfG in clinical trial settings.	4
Progressive hearing loss, and recurrent sudden sensorineural hearing loss associated with GJB2 mutations--phenotypic spectrum and frequencies of GJB2 mutations in Austria. || Adolescent Adult Austria Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Primers Disease Progression Female Gene Frequency Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Polymerase Chain Reaction Recurrence || Mutations of GJB2 (encoding connexin 26) are the most common cause of hearing loss (HL) in different populations, and a broad spectrum of GJB2 mutations has been identified. We screened 204 consecutive patients with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss for GJB2 mutations. Causative GJB2mutations were identified in 31 (15.2%) patients, and two common mutations, c.35delG and L90P (c.269T>C), accounted for 72.1% and 9.8% of GJB2 disease alleles. In four additional patients (2.0%) only one recessive GJB2 mutation was identified, making genetic counselling difficult. No genotype-phenotype correlation was established. We found, however, that homozygotes for truncating mutations were more likely to have a more severe degree of HL compared with other genotypes. Moreover, we showed by co-segregation studies that L90P is a GJB2 disease allele, and that compound heterozygotes for L90P and any recessive mutation share a mild to moderate phenotype. GJB2-associated HL was linked with progressive HL or with recurrent sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in three of 15 cases being analysed retrospectively. We extended the phenotypic spectrum of GJB2-related disease and recommend GJB2 mutation screening also in cases of progressive HL, and recurrent SSNHL. In addition, a carrier frequency of 1/110 (0.9%) for the most common Caucasian mutation in this gene, c.35delG, was determined in 1,212 blood donors from West-Austria, supporting the prevailing hypothesis of a Mediterranean founder mutation. Based on population and patient data, an overall GJB2 mutation carrier frequency of 1.3% was estimated for West-Austria.	4
Preimplantation testing for phenylketonuria. || Adult Embryo Transfer Embryonic Development Female Fertilization in Vitro Genotype Haplotypes Humans Male Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Pregnancy Prenatal Diagnosis Restriction Mapping || To use preimplantation genetic diagnosis to achieve a phenylketonuria-free pregnancy in a couple at 50% risk for producing an affected child. DNA analysis of the first and second polar bodies (PB1 and PB2) obtained from oocytes of a heterozygous mother in IVF-ET, with the goal of identifying and transferring back to the patient the embryos resulting from mutation-free oocytes. IVF program of Reproductive Genetics Institute, Chicago, Illinois. A mother carrying the R408W mutation and a father with compound heterozygosity for R408 and Y414C mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Removal and testing for maternal mutation in PB1 and PB2 from each oocyte after standard IVF. DNA analysis of PB1 and PB2 indicating whether corresponding oocytes were mutation-free, for the purposes of transferring only unaffected embryos resulting from these oocytes. Of 11 zygotes with both PB1 and PB2, 6 were predicted to be free of phenylketonuria. Of these, 4 were transferred, resulting in an unaffected twin pregnancy and birth of two healthy children. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of phenylketonuria resulted in the birth of phenylketonuria-free children. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis by PB analysis in couples with a compound heterozygous male partner is clinically useful.	3

Although incidence of the intestinal-type gastric cancer has decreased, the incidence of diffuse-type is still increasing and its progression is notoriously aggressive. There is insufficient information on genome variations of diffuse-type gastric cancer because its cells are usually mixed with normal cells, and this low cellularity has made it difficult to analyze the genome. We analyze whole genomes and corresponding exomes of diffuse-type gastric cancer, using matched tumor and normal samples from 14 diffuse-type and five intestinal-type gastric cancer patients. Somatic variations found in the diffuse-type gastric cancer are compared to those of the intestinal-type and to previously reported variants. We determine the average exonic somatic mutation rate of the two types. We find associated candidate driver genes, and identify seven novel somatic mutations in CDH1, which is a well-known gastric cancer-associated gene. Three-dimensional structure analysis of the mutated E-cadherin protein suggests that these new somatic mutations could cause significant functional perturbations of critical calcium-binding sites in the EC1-2 junction. Chromosomal instability analysis shows that the MDM2 gene is amplified. After thorough structural analysis, a novel fusion gene TSC2-RNF216 is identified, which may simultaneously disrupt tumor-suppressive pathways and activate tumorigenesis. We report the genomic profile of diffuse-type gastric cancers including new somatic variations, a novel fusion gene, and amplification and deletion of certain chromosomal regions that contain oncogenes and tumor suppressors.	4
Involvement of p53 in insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 regulation in the breast cancer cell response to DNA damage. || Antineoplastic Agents Apoptosis Breast Neoplasms Caspase 3 Cell Line, Tumor DNA Damage Doxorubicin Etoposide Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Silencing Humans Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 Membrane Proteins Mutation Nerve Tissue Proteins RNA, Small Interfering Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Chemotherapy drugs that induce apoptosis by causing DNA double-strand breaks, upregulate the tumor suppressor p53. This study investigated the regulation of the growth-regulatory protein insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), a p53 target, by DNA-damaging agents in breast cancer cells. IGFBP-3 was upregulated 1.4- to 13-fold in response to doxorubicin and etoposide in MCF-10A, Hs578T, MCF-7 and T47D cells, which express low to moderate basal levels of IGFBP-3. In contrast, IGFBP-3 was strongly downregulated by these agents in cells with high basal levels of IGFBP-3 (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436 and MDA-MB-468). In MDA-MB-468 cells containing the R273H p53 mutation, reported to display gain-of-function properties, chemotherapy-induced suppression of IGFBP-3 was not reversed by the p53 reactivating drug, PRIMA-1, or by p53 silencing, suggesting that the decrease in IGFBP-3 following DNA damage is not a mutant p53 gain-of-function response. SiRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous IGFBP-3 modestly attenuated doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T cells. IGFBP-3 downregulation in some breast cancer cell lines in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapy may have clinical implications because suppression of IGFBP-3 may modulate the apoptotic response. These observations provide further evidence that endogenous IGFBP-3 plays a role in breast cancer cell responsiveness to DNA damaging therapy.	0
BRAF V600E mutations are common in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma: diagnostic and therapeutic implications. || Adolescent Adult Astrocytoma Base Sequence Child DNA Mutational Analysis Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases Female Genotype Glioma Humans Immunohistochemistry In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phosphorylation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Young Adult || Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is low-grade glial neoplasm principally affecting children and young adults. Approximately 40% of PXA are reported to recur within 10 years of primary resection. Upon recurrence, patients receive radiation therapy and conventional chemotherapeutics designed for high-grade gliomas. Genetic changes that can be targeted by selective therapeutics have not been extensively evaluated in PXA and ancillary diagnostic tests to help discriminate PXA from other pleomorphic and often more aggressive astrocytic malignancies are limited. In this study, we apply the SNaPshot multiplexed targeted sequencing platform in the analysis of brain tumors to interrogate 60 genetic loci that are frequently mutated in 15 cancer genes. In our analysis we detect BRAF V600E mutations in 12 of 20 (60%) WHO grade II PXA, in 1 of 6 (17%) PXA with anaplasia and in 1 glioblastoma arising in a PXA. Phospho-ERK was detected in all tumors independent of the BRAF mutation status. BRAF duplication was not detected in any of the PXA cases. BRAF V600E mutations were identified in only 2 of 71 (2.8%) glioblastoma (GBM) analyzed, including 1 of 9 (11.1%) giant cell GBM (gcGBM). The finding that BRAF V600E mutations are common in the majority of PXA has important therapeutic implications and may help in differentiating less aggressive PXAs from lethal gcGBMs and GBMs.	4
Extracellular LDLR repeats modulate Wnt signaling activity by promoting LRP6 receptor endocytosis mediated by the Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase. ||  || The LOW-density lipoprotein related protein 6 (LRP6) receptor is an important effector of canonical Wnt signaling, a developmental pathway, whose dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases including cancer. The membrane proximal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor repeats in LRP6 exhibit homology to ligand binding repeats in the LDL receptor (LDLR), but lack known function. We generated single amino acid substitutions of LRP6-LDLR repeat residues, which are highly conserved in the human LDLR and mutated in patients with Familial Hypercholesteremia (FH). These substitutions negatively impacted LRP6 internalization and activation of Wnt signaling. By mass spectrometry, we observed that the Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with and ubiquitinated wild type LRP6 but not the LDLR repeat mutants. These findings establish the involvement of LRP6-LDLR repeats in the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling.	0
E-cadherin destabilization accounts for the pathogenicity of missense mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. || Algorithms Amino Acid Sequence Animals CHO Cells Cadherins Cricetinae Cricetulus Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense Stomach Neoplasms || E-cadherin is critical for the maintenance of tissue architecture due to its role in cell-cell adhesion. E-cadherin mutations are the genetic cause of Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC) and missense mutations represent a clinical burden, due to the uncertainty of their pathogenic role. In vitro and in vivo, most mutations lead to loss-of-function, although the causal factor is unknown for the majority. We hypothesized that destabilization could account for the pathogenicity of E-cadherin missense mutations in HDGC, and tested our hypothesis using in silico and in vitro tools. FoldX algorithm was used to calculate the impact of each mutation in E-cadherin native-state stability, and the analysis was complemented with evolutionary conservation, by SIFT. Interestingly, HDGC patients harbouring germline E-cadherin destabilizing mutants present a younger age at diagnosis or death, suggesting that the loss of native-state stability of E-cadherin accounts for the disease phenotype. To elucidate the biological relevance of E-cadherin destabilization in HDGC, we investigated a group of newly identified HDGC-associated mutations (E185V, S232C and L583R), of which L583R is predicted to be destabilizing. We show that this mutation is not functional in vitro, exhibits shorter half-life and is unable to mature, due to premature proteasome-dependent degradation, a phenotype reverted by stabilization with the artificial mutation L583I (structurally tolerated). Herein we report E-cadherin structural models suitable to predict the impact of the majority of cancer-associated missense mutations and we show that E-cadherin destabilization leads to loss-of-function in vitro and increased pathogenicity in vivo.	0
Automated validation of genetic variants from large databases: ensuring that variant references refer to the same genomic locations. || Algorithms Amino Acid Substitution Codon Computational Biology Databases, Genetic Electronic Data Processing Humans Molecular Sequence Annotation Point Mutation Sequence Analysis, DNA Software || Accurate annotations of genomic variants are necessary to achieve full-genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically sound and medically relevant. Many disease associations, especially those reported before the completion of the HGP, are limited in applicability because of potential inconsistencies with our current standards for genomic coordinates, nomenclature and gene structure. In an effort to validate and link variants from the medical genetics literature to an unambiguous reference for each variant, we developed a software pipeline and reviewed 68 641 single amino acid mutations from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and dbSNP. The frequency of unresolved mutation annotations varied widely among the databases, ranging from 4 to 23%. A taxonomy of primary causes for unresolved mutations was produced. This program is freely available from the web site (http://safegene.hms.harvard.edu/aa2nt/).	4
Connexin 26 gene mutations in congenitally deaf children: pitfalls for genetic counseling. ||  || To evaluate difficulties encountered in genetic counseling in deaf children carrying connexin 26 gene (CX26 or GJB2) mutations. Prospective study. Outpatients, tertiary referral center. Ninety-six unrelated deaf children in whom CX26 mutations had been detected consecutively. Children were recruited to a center for genetic counseling for deaf children, and all had congenital deafness, sporadic or familial. In 63 children, deafness was clearly a DFNB1 form with autosomal recessive inheritance: 47 of the 63 were homozygous for the most frequent mutation, the deletion of G at position 35 (35delG); 16 of 63 carried on both alleles of CX26 frameshift or stop mutations, or missense mutations affecting a critical region of the gene. In 33 of 96 children, genetic counseling was difficult: 21 of 33 had a single mutation detected, 11 of 33 had new missense mutations or mutations whose pathogenicity remains debated in the literature, and 1 of 33 had a genotype with both a recessive mutation (35delG) and a mutation acting as a dominant mutation. Interpretation of results for the molecular diagnosis of mutations in the connexin 26 gene is difficult in almost one third of cases. Close collaboration between geneticists familiar with deafness and otolaryngologists is essential to provide a high standard of genetic advice.	4
De novo ALK kinase domain mutations are uncommon in kinase inhibitor-naïve ALK rearranged lung cancers. || Adenocarcinoma Adenocarcinoma of Lung Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung Cell Line, Tumor Crizotinib Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Gene Rearrangement Humans Lung Neoplasms Mutation Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs Protein Kinase Inhibitors Pyrazoles Pyridines Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases Treatment Outcome || Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged lung adenocarcinomas are responsive to the multitargeted ALK inhibitor crizotinib. One of the common mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib is the acquisition of ALK kinase domain mutations. However, the presence of ALK mutations in crizotinib-naïve tumors has not been widely reported and it is unclear if de novo ALK mutations affect the response to crizotinib. We analyzed preclinical models of ALK rearranged lung cancers that were sensitive/resistant to ALK inhibitors, probed our institutional and other lung cancer databases for tumors with ALK kinase domain mutations, and evaluated tumor response to crizotinib. ALK rearranged cell lines with ALK kinase domain mutations were heterogeneously less inhibited by increasing concentrations of crizotinib than cells driven solely by EML4-ALK fusions. Previous ALK rearranged lung cancer cohorts did not report ALK kinase mutations in inhibitor-naïve tumors. We identified one TKI-naïve ALK rearranged tumor with an ALK kinase domain mutation: ALK-S1206F (mutations at ALK-S1206 shifted crizotinib inhibitory curves only minimally in preclinical models). The never smoker whose tumor harbored de novo EML4-ALK-E5;A20+ALK-S1206F only achieved a 4-month radiographic response to crizotinib 250mg twice daily. Combining data from our and prior cohorts, ALK kinase domain mutations were uncommon events (<3% of cases) in ALK inhibitor-naïve ALK rearranged lung adenocarcinomas but their effect on intrinsic resistance to ALK inhibitors should be better evaluated.	0
Characterization of a transforming N-ras gene in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2: additional evidence for the importance of c-myc and ras cooperation in hepatocarcinogenesis. || Alleles Animals Base Sequence Blotting, Northern Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Division Codon Gene Amplification Genes, Dominant Genes, ras Humans Liver Neoplasms Mice Mice, Nude Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Protein Biosynthesis RNA, Messenger Transcription, Genetic Transfection Tumor Cells, Cultured || The expression of the c-myc gene has previously been shown to be elevated and deregulated in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 (B. E. Huber and S. S. Thorgeirsson, Cancer Res., 47: 3414-3420, 1987). We now report that the Hep G2 N-ras gene is activated to a dominant-acting, transforming gene by a missense mutation in codon 61. Hep G2 DNA produced transformed foci when transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Subsequent to a secondary round of transfection, Southern blot analysis of tumorigenic NIH 3T3 foci demonstrated the presence of human N-ras sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis of one Hep G2 N-ras allele demonstrated that codons 12, 13, and 59 were normal and that codon 61 had a missense mutation (CAA to CTA). This mutation results in the incorporation of leucine instead of glutamine at residue 61 of the N-ras gene product, p21. N-ras sequences were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from both Hep G2 genomic DNA and Hep G2 complementary DNA. Analysis of the amplified sequences demonstrated that only one Hep G2 N-ras allele exhibited the codon 61 mutation and that both the mutant and normal alleles were transcribed. Northern blot analysis demonstrated equivalent steady-state levels of N-ras transcripts in Hep G2 cells and normal human liver. The steady-state levels of N-ras and ornithine decarboxylase transcripts were positively correlated suggesting a positive relationship between N-ras expression and the replication rate of Hep G2 cells. c-Ki-ras and c-Ha-ras transcripts were not detected in either Hep G2 cells or normal human liver. Immunoprecipitation experiments using the monoclonal antibody Y13-259 demonstrated the presence of p21 in Hep G2 cells. Expression of a dominant-acting, transforming N-ras gene, in conjunction with the altered regulation of the c-myc gene, documents two important genetic lesions that could be responsible for the transformed phenotype of Hep G2 cells.	0
Synergistic antitumor interaction between valproic acid, capecitabine and radiotherapy in colorectal cancer: critical role of p53. || Capecitabine Colorectal Neoplasms Flow Cytometry Humans Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Valproic Acid || Recurrence with distant metastases has become the predominant pattern of failure in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), thus the integration of new antineoplastic agents into preoperative fluoropyrimidine-based chemo-radiotherapy represents a clinical challenge to implement an intensified therapeutic strategy. The present study examined the combination of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA) with fluoropyrimidine-based chemo-radiotherapy on colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. HCT-116 (p53-wild type), HCT-116 p53-/- (p53-null), SW620 and HT29 (p53-mutant) CRC cell lines were used to assess the antitumor interaction between VPA and capecitabine metabolite 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) in combination with radiotherapy and to evaluate the role of p53 in the combination treatment. Effects on proliferation, clonogenicity and apoptosis were evaluated, along with γH2AX foci formation as an indicator for DNA damage. Combined treatment with equipotent doses of VPA and 5'-DFUR resulted in synergistic effects in CRC lines expressing p53 (wild-type or mutant). In HCT-116 p53-/- cells we observed antagonist effects. Radiotherapy further potentiated the antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic and DNA damage effects induced by 5'-DFUR/VPA combination in p53 expressing cells. These results highlighted the role of VPA as valuable candidate to be added to preoperative chemo-radiotherapy in LARC. On these bases we launched the ongoing phase I/II study of VPA and short-course radiotherapy plus capecitabine as preoperative treatment in low-moderate risk rectal cancer (V-shoRT-R3).	0
Prenatal features of Costello syndrome: ultrasonographic findings and atrial tachycardia. ||  || Delineate prenatal features of Costello syndrome (caused by HRAS mutations), which consists of mental retardation, facial, cardiovascular, skin, and musculoskeletal anomalies, and tumor predisposition. Literature and new cases classified as Group I (pre-HRAS), Group II (HRAS confirmed), and Group III (HRAS confirmed in natural history study, plus three contributed cases). Polyhydramnios occurred in most (mean 79%) pregnancies of cases in Groups I (98), II (107), and III (17); advanced paternal age and prematurity were noted in approximately half. Less frequent were nuchal thickening, ascites, shortened long bones, abnormal hand posture, ventriculomegaly, macrosomia, and macrocephaly. Fetal arrhythmia occurred in nine cases (six supraventricular or unspecified tachycardia, one unspecified arrhythmia, and two premature atrial contractions, PACs); excluding three new cases and two with PACs, the estimated prenatal frequency is 4/222 (2%). Costello syndrome can be suspected prenatally when polyhydramnios is accompanied by nuchal thickening, hydrops, shortened long bones, abnormal hand posture, ventriculomegaly, large size, and macrocephaly, and especially fetal atrial tachycardia. Consideration should be given for timely prenatal diagnostic studies for confirmative HRAS gene mutations and for maternal treatment of serious fetal arrhythmia.	4
Feasibility of monitoring advanced melanoma patients using cell-free DNA from plasma. || Biomarkers, Tumor Cell-Free Nucleic Acids Feasibility Studies Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Pilot Projects Skin Neoplasms || To determine the feasibility of liquid biopsy for monitoring of patients with advanced melanoma, cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma for 25 Stage III/IV patients, most (84.0%) having received previous therapy. DNA concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 390.0 ng/ml (median = 7.8 ng/ml) and were positively correlated with tumor burden as measured by imaging (Spearman rho = 0.5435, p = .0363). Using ultra-deep sequencing for a 61-gene panel, one or more mutations were detected in 12 of 25 samples (48.0%), and this proportion did not vary significantly for patients on or off therapy at the time of blood draw (52.9% and 37.5% respectively; p = .673). Sixteen mutations were detected in eight different genes, with the most frequent mutations detected in BRAF, NRAS, and KIT. Allele fractions ranged from 1.1% to 63.2% (median = 29.1%). Among patients with tissue next-generation sequencing, nine of 11 plasma mutations were also detected in matched tissue, for a concordance of 81.8%.	4
Analysis of tumor template from multiple compartments in a blood sample provides complementary access to peripheral tumor biomarkers. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Circulating Tumor DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplastic Cells, Circulating || Targeted cancer therapeutics are promised to have a major impact on cancer treatment and survival. Successful application of these novel treatments requires a molecular definition of a patient's disease typically achieved through the use of tissue biopsies. Alternatively, allowing longitudinal monitoring, biomarkers derived from blood, isolated either from circulating tumor cell derived DNA (ctcDNA) or circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ccfDNA) may be evaluated. In order to use blood derived templates for mutational profiling in clinical decisions, it is essential to understand the different template qualities and how they compare to biopsy derived template DNA as both blood-based templates are rare and distinct from the gold-standard. Using a next generation re-sequencing strategy, concordance of the mutational spectrum was evaluated in 32 patient-matched ctcDNA and ccfDNA templates with comparison to tissue biopsy derived DNA template. Different CTC antibody capture systems for DNA isolation from patient blood samples were also compared. Significant overlap was observed between ctcDNA, ccfDNA and tissue derived templates. Interestingly, if the results of ctcDNA and ccfDNA template sequencing were combined, productive samples showed similar detection frequency (56% vs 58%), were temporally flexible, and were complementary both to each other and the gold standard. These observations justify the use of a multiple template approach to the liquid biopsy, where germline, ctcDNA, and ccfDNA templates are employed for clinical diagnostic purposes and open a path to comprehensive blood derived biomarker access.	4
Various forms of mutant p53 confer sensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin in bladder cancer cells. ||  || The nature of p53 mutation has been reported to affect cellular responses to chemotherapy. We characterized the impact of p53 mutations on drug resistance in bladder cancer cells. Various human p53 mutants (V143A, V173L, H179Q, N247I and R273H) were introduced to the TCC-SUP bladder carcinoma cell line to establish stable transfectants. The expression of mutant p53 was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemical analysis. The sensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin in these transfectants was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cell death mediated by cisplatin and doxorubicin was characterized by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling analysis, Hoechst 33258 staining and annexin-V binding assay. The expression of all forms of mutant p53 protein except p53His273 enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin. The chemosensitivity of p53His273 transfectants is similar to that of parental TCC-SUP and control transfectants. Cisplatin induced cell death undergoes apoptosis, as demonstrated by Hoechst staining, annexin-V assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling, respectively. In contrast, doxorubicin induced cell death probably occurs through a nonapoptotic pathway. These results indicated that the nature of p53 mutations may affect the cellular response to anticancer drugs and many forms of mutant p53 protein may enhance chemosensitivity through apoptotic or nonapoptotic pathways in bladder cancer cells.	0

Hot-spot mutants of p53 core domain evince characteristic local structural changes. || Binding Sites DNA-Binding Proteins Humans Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Models, Molecular Mutation Neoplasms Protein Structure, Secondary Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Most of the oncogenic mutations in the tumor suppressor p53 map to its DNA-binding (core) domain. It is thus a potential target in cancer therapy for rescue by drugs. To begin to understand how mutation inactivates p53 and hence to provide a structural basis for drug design, we have compared structures of wild-type and mutant p53 core domains in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Structural changes introduced by five hot-spot mutations (V143A, G245S, R248Q, R249S, and R273H) were monitored by chemical-shift changes. Only localized changes are observed for G245S, R248Q, R249S, and R273H, suggesting that the overall tertiary folds of these mutant proteins are similar to that of wild type. Structural changes in R273H are found mainly in the loop-sheet-helix motif and the loop L3 of the core domain. Mutations in L3 (G245S, R248Q, and R249S) introduce structural changes in the loop L2 and L3 as well as terminal residues of strands 4, 9, and 10. It is noteworthy that R248Q, which is often regarded as a contact mutant that affects only interactions with DNA, introduces structural changes as extensive as the other loop L3 mutations (G245S and R249S). These changes suggest that R248Q is also a structural mutant that perturbs the structure of loop L2-L3 regions of the p53 core domain. In contrast to other mutants, replacement of the core residue valine 143 to alanine causes chemical-shift changes in almost all residues in the beta-sandwich and the DNA-binding surface. Long-range effects of V143A mutation may affect the specificity of DNA binding.	0
Down-regulation of the RUNX1-target gene NR4A3 contributes to hematopoiesis deregulation in familial platelet disorder/acute myelogenous leukemia. || Adolescent Adult Animals Cell Proliferation Cells, Cultured Clone Cells Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit DNA-Binding Proteins Down-Regulation Female HEK293 Cells Hematopoiesis Hematopoietic Stem Cells Humans Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute Male Mice Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Platelet Storage Pool Deficiency Receptors, Steroid Receptors, Thyroid Hormone T-Lymphocytes Young Adult || RUNX1 encodes a DNA-binding α subunit of the core-binding factor, a heterodimeric transcription factor. RUNX1 is a master regulatory gene in hematopoiesis and its disruption is one of the most common aberrations in acute leukemia. Inactivating or dominant-negative mutations in the RUNX1 gene have been also identified in pedigrees of familial platelet disorders with a variable propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML). We performed analysis of hematopoiesis from 2 FPD/AML pedigrees with 2 distinct RUNX1 germline mutations, that is, the R139X in a pedigree without AML and the R174Q mutation in a pedigree with AML. Both mutations induced a marked increase in the clonogenic potential of immature CD34(+)CD38(-) progenitors, with some self-renewal capacities observed only for R174Q mutation. This increased proliferation correlated with reduction in the expression of NR4A3, a gene previously implicated in leukemia development. We demonstrated that NR4A3 was a direct target of RUNX1 and that restoration of NR4A3 expression partially reduced the clonogenic potential of patient progenitors. We propose that the down-regulation of NR4A3 in RUNX1-mutated hematopoietic progenitors leads to an increase in the pool of cells susceptible to be hit by secondary leukemic genetic events.	4
High prevalence of genetic variants previously associated with LQT syndrome in new exome data. || Exome Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genotype Humans Long QT Syndrome Mutation, Missense Prevalence || To date, hundreds of variants in 13 genes have been associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS). The prevalence of LQTS is estimated to be between 1:2000 and 1:5000. The knowledge of genetic variation in the general population has until recently been limited, but newly published data from NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) has provided important knowledge on this topic. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants in ESP (5400 individuals), in order to identify possible false-positive LQTS variants. With this aim, we performed a search for previously published LQTS-associated variants in ESP. In addition, a PolyPhen-2 prediction was conducted, and the four most prevalent LQTS-associated variants with significant functional effects present in ESP were genotyped in a second control population. We identified 33 missense variants previously associated with LQTS in ESP. These 33 variants affected 173 alleles and this corresponded to a LQTS prevalence of 1:31 in the ESP population. PolyPhen-2 predicted 30% of the 33 variants present in ESP to be benign compared with 13% among LQTS-associated variants not present in ESP (P=0.019). Genotyping of the four variants KCNH2 P347S; SCN5A: S216L, V1951L; and CAV3 T78M in the control population (n=704) revealed prevalences comparable to those of ESP. Thus, we identified a much higher prevalence of previously LQTS-associated variants than expected in exome data from population studies. Great caution regarding the possible disease causation of some of these variants has to be taken, especially when used for risk stratification in family members.	4
Mutant p53 proteins behave in a dominant, negative fashion in vivo. ||  || The p53 encodes a cellular phosphoprotein that has been association with both neoplastic transformation and the control of cellular growth. Recent studies have reported that p53 also acts as a transcriptional regulator. We have studied transactivational properties of human wild-type and mutant p53 proteins representing 4 major mutational hotspots (codons 141, 175, 248, 273) as well as a double mutant Tyr141/His273 and a p53 with the transcriptional activating region removed (pcDC2). Transactivation by p53 was shown with a p53 concensus binding sequence controlled CAT reporter gene, and activity was assayed after co-transfection of the reporter with either wild-type or mutant p53 expression constructs. Wild-type p53 as well as one mutant p53 [(mutation of arginine to histidine at codon 273 (His 273)], had strong transactivating activity, but all other mutant p53s were inactive in transcriptional activation, including the double mutant Tyr141/His273 suggesting that the Tyr141 mutation was dominant over the His273 mutation in the same protein. Moreover, when mutant p53 (Tyr141, His175, Trp248, or Tyr141/His273) was cotransfected with either wild-type p53 or mutant His273 p53, these mutants inhibited the transactivation of coexpressed wild-type p53. The p53 vector (pcDC2), which contains p53 oligomerization sequences, but not the transactivational domain, markedly inhibited wild-type p53 transactivational activity. Each of the mutant p53s similarly inhibited the transactivation of His273 p53. Therefore, with the exception of His273, each of the other mutant p53 were unable to transactivate and each behaved in a dominant negative fashion.	0
Prevalence and complications of single-gene and chromosomal disorders in craniosynostosis. || Chromosome Aberrations Craniosynostoses Cytogenetic Analysis Exons Genetic Diseases, Inborn Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Molecular Biology Neurosurgical Procedures Point Mutation Prevalence Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3 Reconstructive Surgical Procedures Signal Transduction || We describe the first cohort-based analysis of the impact of genetic disorders in craniosynostosis. We aimed to refine the understanding of prognoses and pathogenesis and to provide rational criteria for clinical genetic testing. We undertook targeted molecular genetic and cytogenetic testing for 326 children who required surgery because of craniosynostosis, were born in 1993-2002, presented to a single craniofacial unit, and were monitored until the end of 2007. Eighty-four children (and 64 relatives) had pathologic genetic alterations (86% single-gene mutations and 14% chromosomal abnormalities). The FGFR3 P250R mutation was the single largest contributor (24%) to the genetic group. Genetic diagnoses accounted for 21% of all craniosynostosis cases and were associated with increased rates of many complications. Children with an initial clinical diagnosis of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis were more likely to have a causative mutation if the synostoses were unicoronal or bicoronal (10 of 48 cases) than if they were sagittal or metopic (0 of 55 cases; P = .0003). Repeat craniofacial surgery was required for 58% of children with single-gene mutations but only 17% of those with chromosomal abnormalities (P = .01). Clinical genetic assessment is critical for the treatment of children with craniosynostosis. Genetic testing of nonsyndromic cases (at least for FGFR3 P250R and FGFR2 exons IIIa/c) should be targeted to patients with coronal or multisuture synostoses. Single-gene disorders that disrupt physiologic signaling in the cranial sutures often require reoperation, whereas chromosomal abnormalities follow a more-indolent course, which suggests a different, secondary origin of the associated craniosynostosis.	4
Spectrum of mutations in Chinese children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. || Adolescent Age of Onset Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child Child, Preschool China Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Drug Resistance Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Glucocorticoids High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Homozygote Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Male Membrane Proteins Mutation, Missense Nephrotic Syndrome Protein Kinases Proteinuria Sequence Analysis, DNA TRPC6 Cation Channel WT1 Proteins || The aim of this study was to elucidate whether genetic screening test results of pediatric patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) vary with ethnicity. Using high-throughput DNA sequencing, 28 nephrotic syndrome-related genes were analyzed in 110 chil-dren affected by SRNS and 10 children with isolated proteinuria enrolled by 5 centers in China (67 boys, 53 girls). Their age at disease onset ranged from 1 day to 208 months (median, 48.8 months). Patients were excluded if their age at onset of disease was over 18 years or if they were diagnosed as having Alport syndrome. A genetic etiology was identified in 28.3% of our cohort and the likelihood of establishing a genetic diagnosis decreased as the age at onset of nephrotic syndrome increased. The most common mutated genes were ADCK4 (6.67%), NPHS1 (5.83%), WT1 (5.83%), and NPHS2 (3.33%), and the difference in the frequencies of ADCK4 and NPHS2 mutations between this study and a study on monogenic causes of SRNS in the largest international cohort of 1,783 different families was significant. A case of congenital nephrotic syndrome was attributed to a homozygous missense mutation in ADCK4, and a de novo missense mutation in TRPC6 was detected in a case of infantile nephrotic syndrome. Our results showed that, in the first and the largest multicenter cohort of Chinese pediatric SRNS reported to date, ADCK4 is the most common causative gene, whereas there is a low prevalence of NPHS2 mutations. Our data indicated that the genetic testing results for pediatric SRNS patients vary with different ethnicities, and this information will help to improve management of the disease in clinical practice.	4
The genetic spectrum of familial hypercholesterolemia in Pakistan. || Adult Amino Acid Sequence Apolipoproteins B Base Sequence Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Female Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Introns Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Pakistan Pedigree Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Receptors, LDL Serine Endopeptidases || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the genes coding for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) or apo-lipoprotein B-100 (APOB). The aim of the present work was to determine the genetic basis of dyslipidemia in 11 unrelated Pakistani families. High resolution melting (HRM), sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Probands were screened for the promoter and all coding regions, including intron/exon boundaries, of LDLR and PCSK9 and part of exon 26 of APOB including p.(R3527Q). Two families were identified with previously unreported LDLR mutations (c.1019_1020delinsTG, p.(C340L) and c.1634G>A, p.(G545E)). Both probands had tendon xanthomas or xanthelasma and/or a history of cardiovascular disease. Co-segregation with hypercholesterolemia was demonstrated in both families. In silico studies predicted these variations to be damaging. In two families, novel PCSK9 variations were identified (exon2; c.314G>A, p.(R105Q) and exon3; c.464C>T, p.(P155L)). In silico studies suggested both were likely to be damaging, and family members carrying the p.(105Q) allele had lower total cholesterol levels, suggesting this is a loss-of-function mutation. For c.464C>T p.(P155L) the small number of relatives available precluded any strong inference. This report brings to seven the number of different LDLR mutations reported in FH patients from Pakistan and, as expected in this heterogeneous population, no common LDLR mutation has been identified.	4
Phenotype and prognostic correlations of the converter region mutations affecting the β myosin heavy chain. || Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathies Echocardiography Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Pedigree Phenotype Prognosis Spain Survival Analysis || The prognostic value of genetic studies in cardiomyopathies is still controversial. Our objective was to evaluate the outcome of patients with cardiomyopathy with mutations in the converter domain of β myosin heavy chain (MYH7). Clinical characteristics and survival of 117 affected members with mutations in the converter domain of MYH7 were compared with 409 patients described in the literature with mutations in the same region. Twenty-five mutations were evaluated (9 in our families including 3 novel (Ile730Asn, Asp717Gly and Arg719Pro)). Clinical diagnoses were hypertrophic (n=407), dilated (n=15), non-compaction (n=4) and restrictive (n=5) cardiomyopathies, unspecified cardiomyopathy (n=11), sudden death (n=50) and 35 healthy carriers. One hundred eighty-four had events (cardiovascular death or transplant). Median event-free survival was 50±2 years in our patients and 53±3 years in the literature (p=0.27). There were significant differences in the outcome between mutation: Ile736Thr had fewer events than other mutations in the region (p=0.01), while Arg719Gln (p<0.01) had reduced event-free survival. Mutations in the converter region are generally associated with adverse prognosis although there are differences between mutations. The identification of a mutation in this particular region provides important prognostic information that should be considered in the clinical management of affected patients.	4

NF1 mutations occur in lung cancer, but their clinical significance is unknown. We evaluated clinical and molecular characteristics of NF1 mutant lung cancers with comparison to tumors with KRAS mutations. Between July 2013 and October 2014, 591 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors underwent targeted next-generation sequencing in a 275 gene panel that evaluates gene mutations and genomic rearrangements. NF1 and KRAS cohorts were identified, with subsequent clinical and genomic analysis. Among 591 patients, 60 had NF1 mutations (10%) and 141 (24%) had KRAS mutations. 15 NF1 mutations (25%) occurred with other oncogenic mutations [BRAF (2); ERBB2 (2); KRAS (9); HRAS (1); NRAS (1)]. There were 72 unique NF1 variants. NF1 tumor pathology was diverse, including both adenocarcinoma (36, 60%) and squamous cell carcinoma (10, 17%). In contrast, KRAS mutations occurred predominantly in adenocarcinoma (136, 96%). Both mutations were common in former/current smokers. Among NF1 tumors without concurrent oncogenic alterations, TP53 mutations/2-copy deletions occurred more often (33, 65%) than with KRAS mutation (46, 35%; P < 0.001). No difference between cohorts was seen with other tumor suppressors. NF1 mutations define a unique population of NSCLC. NF1 and KRAS mutations present in similar patient populations, but NF1 mutations occur more often with other oncogenic alterations and TP53 mutations. Therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS activation, including inhibitors of MAP kinase signaling, may warrant investigation in NF1 mutant tumors. Tumor-suppressor inactivation patterns may help further define novel treatment strategies. Clin Cancer Res; 22(13); 3148-56. ©2016 AACR.	4
Prediction and Analysis of Breast Cancer Related Deleterious Non-Synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the PTEN Gene. ||  || One of the most common cancer types faced by the women around the world is breast cancer.

In this study, we predicted and analyzed the impact of three deleterious coding non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms rs121909218 (G129E), rs121909229 (R130Q) and rs57374291 (D107N) in the PTEN gene on the phenotype of breast tumors using computational tools SIFT, Polyphen-2, PROVEAN, MUPro, POPMusic and the GETAREA server.	4
Using thermal scanning assays to test protein-protein interactions of inner-ear cadherins. || Animals Cadherins Ear, Inner Kinetics Mice Models, Molecular Mutant Proteins Mutation Protein Binding Protein Denaturation Protein Interaction Mapping Protein Precursors Solutions Surface Plasmon Resonance Temperature || Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in biological processes such as cell-cell adhesion, immune system-pathogen interactions, and sensory perception. Understanding the structural determinants of protein-protein complex formation and obtaining quantitative estimates of their dissociation constant (KD) are essential for the study of these interactions and for the discovery of new therapeutics. At the same time, it is equally important to characterize protein-protein interactions in a high-throughput fashion. Here, we use a modified thermal scanning assay to test interactions of wild type (WT) and mutant variants of N-terminal fragments (EC1+2) of cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15, two proteins essential for inner-ear mechanotransduction. An environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye (SYPRO orange) is used to monitor melting temperature (Tm) shifts of protocadherin-15 EC1+2 (pcdh15) in the presence of increasing concentrations of cadherin-23 EC1+2 (cdh23). These Tm shifts are absent when we use proteins containing deafness-related missense mutations known to disrupt cdh23 binding to pcdh15, and are increased for some rationally designed mutants expected to enhance binding. In addition, surface plasmon resonance binding experiments were used to test if the Tm shifts correlated with changes in binding affinity. We used this approach to find a double mutation (cdh23(T15E)- pcdh15(G16D)) that enhances binding affinity of the cadherin complex by 1.98 kJ/mol, roughly two-fold that of the WT complex. We suggest that the thermal scanning methodology can be used in high-throughput format to quickly compare binding affinities (KD from nM up to 100 μM) for some heterodimeric protein complexes and to screen small molecule libraries to find protein-protein interaction inhibitors and enhancers.	0
BRAF and NRAS Mutations in Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma and Concordance in BRAF Mutations Between Primary and Corresponding Lymph Node Metastases. || Adult Age Factors Carcinoma, Papillary Female GTP Phosphohydrolases Humans Lymphatic Metastasis Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Retrospective Studies Thyroid Cancer, Papillary Thyroid Neoplasms Young Adult || Concordance between mutations in the primary papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and the paired x lymph node metastasis may elucidate the potential role of molecular targeted therapy in advanced stages. BRAF and NRAS mutations in primary PTC (n = 253) with corresponding metastatic lymph node (n = 46) were analyzed utilizing StripAssays (ViennaLab Diagnostics). Statistical analysis was performed using (SPSS, Inc.), version 24.0 with a p-value of <0.05, and concordance via kappa agreement. BRAF mutation frequency in conventional PTC (cPTC): 56.8%, papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC): 36.5%, PTMC-FV: 2.7% and PTC-FV: 4.1%. NRAS mutation frequency in PTC-FV: 28.6%, PTMC: 28.6%, PTMC-FV: 23.8%, and cPTC: 19.0%. BRAF mutation correlation with older age in cPTC (42.6 versus 33.6) years (p < 0.001) was the only significant clinicopathologic parameter. BRAF mutations were concordant in the primary and its corresponding lymph node deposits in PTC with a kappa of 0.77 (p-value < 0.0001). BRAF mutations are predominant in cPTC and PTMC while NRAS mutations in PTC-FV. BRAF mutation is conserved in metastatic lymph node deposits, thus BRAF is an early mutational pathogenetic driver. Therefore, targeted therapy is potential in recurrent and advanced stage disease.	4
Improving performance of multigene panels for genomic analysis of cancer predisposition. || Adult BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Colorectal Neoplasms Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Neoplasm Proteins Risk Factors || Screening multiple genes for inherited cancer predisposition expands opportunities for cancer prevention; however, reports of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) may limit clinical usefulness. We used an expert-driven approach, exploiting all available information, to evaluate multigene panels for inherited cancer predisposition in a clinical series that included multiple cancer types and complex family histories. For 1,462 sequential patients referred for testing by BROCA or ColoSeq multigene panels, genomic DNA was sequenced and variants were interpreted by multiple experts using International Agency for Research on Cancer guidelines and incorporating evolutionary conservation, known and predicted variant consequences, and personal and family cancer history. Diagnostic yield was evaluated for various presenting conditions and family-history profiles. Of 1,462 patients, 12% carried damaging mutations in established cancer genes. Diagnostic yield varied by clinical presentation. Actionable results were identified for 13% of breast and colorectal cancer patients and for 4% of cancer-free subjects, based on their family histories of cancer. Incidental findings explaining cancer in neither the patient nor the family were present in 1.7% of subjects. Less than 1% of patients carried VUS in BRCA1 or BRCA2. For all genes combined, initial reports contained VUS for 10.5% of patients, which declined to 7.5% of patients after reclassification based on additional information. Individualized interpretation of gene panels is a complex medical activity. Interpretation by multiple experts in the context of personal and family histories maximizes actionable results and minimizes reports of VUS.Genet Med 18 10, 974-981.	4
The impact of genome-wide association studies on the pathophysiology and therapy of cardiovascular disease. || Animals Cardiovascular Diseases Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genome-Wide Association Study Humans || Cardiovascular diseases are leading causes for death worldwide. Genetic disposition jointly with traditional risk factors precipitates their manifestation. Whereas the implications of a positive family history for individual risk have been known for a long time, only in the past few years have genome-wide association studies (GWAS) shed light on the underlying genetic variations. Here, we review these studies designed to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. We focus on the newly established pathways to exemplify the translation from the identification of risk-related genetic variants to new preventive and therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease.	4
Reassessing the significance of the PAH c.158G>A (p.Arg53His) variant in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. || Biomarkers Child, Preschool Female Follow-Up Studies Gene Frequency Genotype Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Prognosis Republic of Korea || The accurate interpretation of sequence variation is critical for successful molecular diagnoses. It is also fundamental to the accurate diagnosis and treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). This study aims to evaluate the significance of the c.158G>A (p.Arg53His) variant in the PAH gene, which was previously reported to be a pathogenic mutation that results in decreased phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity in hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) patients. Seven unrelated Korean patients with HPA genotyped with the c.158G>A variant were included in this study. The variant c.158G>A was classified by the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. By both directly collecting genetic data and comprehensively reviewing the existing literature, we found that this variant is more appropriately classified as "Likely benign" rather than pathogenic. The allele's frequency is 2.57% in the general Korean population, which was greater than expected for phenylketonuria. This variant was observed to be homozygous in healthy subjects and was also observed in cis with other pathogenic variants. It is common in East Asian populations (especially in Koreans) compared to Western populations. There is a possibility that it causes decreased enzyme activity without leading to the full pathology of phenylketonuria. This study expands our understanding of the consequences of variation in PAH and its relationship to HPA.	3
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (embryo screening) for enlarged vestibular aqueduct due to SLC26A4 mutation. ||  || Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is used to analyze embryos genetically before their transfer into the uterus. For families with genetic diseases, PGD offers a chance to have an unaffected child, without facing termination of pregnancy. Although PGD has been performed for many monogenic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and beta-thalassemia, the application of PGD to hereditary hearing impairment has not been explored. In the present study, we reported the development and application of PGD protocols to address enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), which is a common type of hereditary hearing impairment associated with mutations in the SLC26A4 gene. The family requesting PGD had a history of EVA, segregating the SLC26A4 c.919-2A-->G mutation. In short, the PGD process was composed of two steps: the development of a single-cell testing protocol and clinical PGD cycles (i.e., selection and implantation of unaffected embryos using the single-cell testing protocol). First, protocols for genetic testing in a single cell were established for the c.919-2A-->G mutation using GenomiPhi technology and primer extension mini-sequencing. These protocols were validated on single lymphocytes collected from both parents and their affected child. Two clinical PGD cycles were then performed for the parents, with the second cycle successfully leading to a singleton pregnancy. The baby was homozygous for the wild-type SLC26A4 allele and revealed a normal audiological phenotype after birth. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature describing successful PGD in families with genetic hearing impairment. In our opinion, the application of PGD in the field of hereditary hearing impairment involves fewer ethical controversies than other novel applications of PGD and traditional indications for PGD for other monogenic diseases. Therefore, the approach demonstrated in the present study can also be used in a large number of families with other types of hereditary hearing impairment.	4
[ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM GENES OF APOPTOSIS SYSTEM WITH A RISK OF DEVELOPMENT OF COLORECTAL CANCER IN RUSSIAN POPULATION]. ||  || Study the effect of single nucleotide polymorphism genes TP53 (rs1042522, rs1800371), CDKN2A (rs3731217, rs3088440) and MDM2 (rs2279744) on the risk of development of color- ectal cancer (CRC) in population of Perm Region. Case group con- sisted of 198 patients with histologically verified CRC, control group - 205 individuals with CRC excluded by results of colonoscopy. DNA genotyping, obtained from leukocytes of venous blood ofthe studied individuals; was carried out by PCRwith electrophoretic detection of results. Significant inter-population differences of frequency of occurrence of alleles rs 1042522; rs3088440, rs2279744 in Russian population compared with East-Asian and European were detected (p<0.0001). Association of heterozygote (G/T) genotype rs2279744 with a lower risk of development of CRC regardless of sex and age (OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.26 - 0.97) was established. Statistically significant relations between development of CRC and other polymorphisms were not determined. Relations of gene polymorphism of apoptosis system with risk of development of CRC in Russian population was studied for the first time. The data obtained give evidence on the probable reduction of risk of development of CRC with carriage of hetero- zygote genotype of polymorphism rs2279744.	4
Proliferative lesion of anogenital mammary-like glands in the setting of Cowden syndrome: case report and review of the literature. || Adult Anal Canal Female Hamartoma Syndrome, Multiple Humans Hyperplasia || Mammary-like glands are normal appendages of anogenital skin and can give rise to epithelial and stromal tumors that closely resemble breast tumors. Cowden syndrome is an autosomal-dominant cancer-predisposition syndrome that is associated with increased risk of various benign and malignant tumors including breast cancers. Here, we report the first case of a proliferative lesion of mammary-like glands in the setting of Cowden syndrome. A 27-year-old female with Cowden syndrome (R130Q-PTEN mutation) presented with a 1-cm tender, polypoid perianal lesion. An excisional biopsy revealed a circumscribed, lobulated lesion with fibromyxoid stroma and epithelial hyperplasia with apocrine and columnar cell changes that was arranged in papillary, micropapillary and focal cribriform architecture. The features strikingly resembled proliferative changes commonly seen in the breast. Interestingly, the patient subsequently developed an atypical complex sclerosing lesion of the breast. Given the increased risk of breast neoplasia in Cowden syndrome, and the morphologic relationship between breast glands and mammary-like glands, this case raises the possibility of an increased risk of neoplasia arising in mammary-like glands in the setting of Cowden syndrome.	3
The genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease: beyond APP, PSENs and APOE. || Alzheimer Disease Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor Animals Apolipoproteins E Humans Presenilin-1 Presenilin-2 || Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder with a clear genetic component. Three genes have been identified as the cause of early onset familial AD (EOAD). The most common form of the disease, late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), is, however, a sporadic one presenting itself in later stages of life. The genetic component of this late onset form of AD has been the target of a large number of studies, because only one genetic risk factor (APOE4) has been consistently associated with the disease. However, technological advances allow new approaches in the study of complex disorders. In this review, we discuss the new results produced by genome wide association studies, in light of the current knowledge of the complexity of AD genetics.	4
Sensitivity to PRIMA-1MET is associated with decreased MGMT in human glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma stem cells irrespective of p53 status. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Proteins Cell Line, Tumor Cell Survival DNA Modification Methylases DNA Repair Enzymes Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Glioblastoma Humans Mutation Neoplastic Stem Cells Nuclear Proteins Phosphorylation Quinuclidines RNA Interference Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Alterations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene occur in ~30% of primary glioblastoma (GBM) with a high frequency of missense mutations associated with the acquisition of oncogenic "gain-of-function" (GOF) mutant (mut)p53 activities. PRIMA-1MET/APR-246, emerged as a promising compound to rescue wild-type (wt)p53 function in different cancer types. Previous studies suggested the role of wtp53 in the negative regulation of the DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a major determinant in resistance to therapy in GBM treatment. The potential role of MGMT in expression of p53 and the efficacy of PRIMA-1MET with respect to TP53 status and expression of MGMT in GBM remain unknown. We investigated response to PRIMA-1MET of wtp53/MGMT-negative (U87MG, A172), mutp53/MGMT-positive U138, LN-18, T98/Empty vector (T98/EV) and its isogenic MGMT/shRNA gene knockdown counterpart (T98/shRNA). We show that MGMT silencing decreased expression of mutp53/GOF in T98/shRNA. PRIMA-1MET further cleared T98/shRNA cells of mutp53, decreased proliferation and clonogenic potential, abrogated the G2 checkpoint control, increased susceptibility to apoptotic cell death, expression of GADD45A and sustained expression of phosphorylated Erk1/2. PRIMA-1MET increased expression of p21 protein in U87MG and A172 and promoted senescence in U87MG cell line. Importantly, PRIMA-1MET decreased relative cell numbers, disrupted the structure of neurospheres of patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSCs) and enabled activation of wtp53 with decreased expression of MGMT in MGMT-positive GSCs or decreased expression of mutp53. Our findings highlight the cell-context dependent effects of PRIMA-1MET irrespective of p53 status and suggest the role of MGMT as a potential molecular target of PRIMA-1MET in MGMT-positive GSCs.	0
Simultaneous detection of BRCA mutations and large genomic rearrangements in germline DNA and FFPE tumor samples. || BRCA1 Protein BRCA2 Protein Breast Neoplasms Computational Biology DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Female Formaldehyde Gene Rearrangement Genome, Human Germ-Line Mutation High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Paraffin Stem Cells || The development of breast and ovarian cancer is strongly connected to the inactivation of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes by different germline and somatic alterations, and their diagnosis has great significance in targeted tumor therapy, since recently approved PARP inhibitors show high efficiency in the treatment of BRCA-deficient tumors. This raises the need for new diagnostic methods that are capable of performing an integrative mutation analysis of the BRCA genes not only from germline DNA but also from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Here we describe the development of such a methodology based on next-generation sequencing and a new bioinformatics software for data analysis. The diagnostic method was initially developed on an Illumina MiSeq NGS platform using germline-mutated stem cell lines and then adapted for the Ion Torrent PGM NGS platform as well. We also investigated the usability of NGS coverage data for the detection of copy number variations and exon deletions as a replacement of the conventional MLPA technique. Finally, we tested the developed workflow on FFPE samples from breast and ovarian cancer patients. Our method meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements for the genetic diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancers both from germline and FFPE samples.	4
Depletion of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) enhances SAHA sensitivity of p53-mutated pancreatic cancer cells through the regulation of mutant p53 and TAp63. || Cell Line, Tumor Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit Down-Regulation Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Gene Knockdown Techniques Genes, p53 Humans Hydroxamic Acids Mutation Pancreatic Neoplasms Transcription Factors Tumor Suppressor Proteins Up-Regulation Vorinostat || Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) represents one of the new class of anti-cancer drugs. However, multiple lines of clinical evidence indicate that SAHA might be sometimes ineffective on certain solid tumors including pancreatic cancer. In this study, we have found for the first time that RUNX2/mutant p53/TAp63-regulatory axis has a pivotal role in the determination of SAHA sensitivity of p53-mutated pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells. According to our present results, MiaPaCa-2 cells responded poorly to SAHA. Forced depletion of mutant p53 stimulated SAHA-mediated cell death of MiaPaCa-2 cells, which was accomapanied by a further accumulation of γH2AX and cleaved PARP. Under these experimental conditions, pro-oncogenic RUNX2 was strongly down-regulated in mutant p53-depleted MiaPaCa-2 cells. Surprisingly, RUNX2 silencing augmented SAHA-dependent cell death of MiaPaCa-2 cells and caused a significant reduction of mutant p53. Consistent with these observations, overexpression of RUNX2 in MiaPaCa-2 cells restored SAHA-mediated decrease in cell viability and increased the amount of mutant p53. Thus, it is suggestive that there exists a positive auto-regulatory loop between RUNX2 and mutant p53, which might amplify their pro-oncogenic signals. Intriguingly, knockdown of mutant p53 or RUNX2 potentiated SAHA-induced up-regulation of TAp63. Indeed, SAHA-stimulated cell death of MiaPaCa-2 cells was partially attenuated by p63 depletion. Collectively, our present observations strongly suggest that RUNX2/mutant p53/TAp63-regulatory axis is one of the key determinants of SAHA sensitivity of p53-mutated pancreatic cancer cells.	0
Prevalence and audiological features in carriers of GJB2 mutations, c.35delG and c.101T>C (p.M34T), in a UK population study. ||  || To determine the carrier rate of the GJB2 mutation c.35delG and c.101T>C in a UK population study; to determine whether carriers of the mutation had worse hearing or otoacoustic emissions compared to non-carriers. Prospective cohort study. University of Bristol, UK. Children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. 9202 were successfully genotyped for the c.35delG mutation and c.101>T and classified as either carriers or non-carriers. Hearing thresholds at age 7, 9 and 11 years and otoacoustic emissions at age 9 and 11. The carrier frequency of the c.35delG mutation was 1.36% (95% CI 1.13 to 1.62) and c.101T>C was 2.69% (95% CI 2.37 to 3.05). Carriers of c.35delG and c.101T>C had worse hearing than non-carriers at the extra-high frequency of 16 kHz. The mean difference in hearing at age 7 for the c.35delG mutation was 8.53 dB (95% CI 2.99, 14.07) and 12.57 dB at age 9 (95% CI 8.10, 17.04). The mean difference for c.101T>C at age 7 was 3.25 dB (95% CI -0.25 to 6.75) and 7.61 dB (95% CI 4.26 to 10.96) at age 9. Otoacoustic emissions were smaller in the c.35delG mutation carrier group: at 4 kHz the mean difference was -4.95 dB (95% CI -6.70 to -3.21) at age 9 and -3.94 dB (95% CI -5.78 to -2.10) at age 11. There was weak evidence for differences in otoacoustic emissions amplitude for c.101T>C carriers. Carriers of the c.35delG mutation and c.101T>C have worse extra-high-frequency hearing than non-carriers. This may be a predictor for changes in lower-frequency hearing in adulthood. The milder effects observed in carriers of c.101T>C are in keeping with its classification as a mutation causing mild/moderate hearing loss in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity.	4
Audiological profile of the prevalent genetic form of childhood sensorineural hearing loss due to GJB2 mutations in northern Greece. || Adolescent Audiometry, Pure-Tone Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Greece Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Prevalence Risk Assessment Severity of Illness Index || The present study describes the audiological profile of genetic hearing loss resulting from GJB2 mutations in northern Greece, as this represents the most frequent single cause of childhood sensorineural hearing loss. The 35delG mutation in homozygosity was detected in 27 of 107 patients (25.2%). The audiological profile is that of a profound or severe sensorineural hearing loss, with a sloping or flat configuration of the audiogram, mostly symmetrical, non-progressive and affecting more the higher frequencies. This profile underlines the importance of early identification and genetic family counseling leading to the future possibility of prevention of deafness.	4
Mutation Screening of Candidate Genes in Patients with Nonsyndromic Sagittal Craniosynostosis. || Craniosynostoses Databases, Factual Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Humans Infant, Newborn Male Molecular Sequence Data Nuclear Proteins Point Mutation Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1 Retrospective Studies Sensitivity and Specificity Twist-Related Protein 1 || Craniosynostosis is a condition that includes the premature fusion of one or multiple cranial sutures. Among various craniosynostosis forms, sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is the most prevalent. Although different gene mutations have been identified in some craniosynostosis syndromes, the cause of sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis remains largely unknown. To screen for candidate genes for sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, the authors sequenced DNA of 93 sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients from a population-based study conducted in Iowa and New York states. FGFR1-3 mutational hotspots and the entire TWIST1, RAB23, and BMP2 coding regions were screened because of their known roles in human nonsyndromic or syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis, expression patterns, and/or animal model studies. The authors identified two rare variants in their cohort. A FGFR1 insertion c.730_731insG, which led to a premature stop codon, was predicted to abolish the entire immunoglobulin-like III domain, including the ligand-binding region. A c.439C>G variant was observed in TWIST1 at its highly conserved loop domain in another patient. The patient's mother harbored the same variant and was reported with jaw abnormalities. These two variants were not detected in 116 alleles from unaffected controls or seen in the several databases; however, TWIST1 variant was found in a low frequency of 0.000831 percent in Exome Aggregation Consortium database. The low mutation detection rate indicates that these genes account for only a small proportion of sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients. The authors' results add to the perception that sagittal nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is a complex developmental defect with considerable genetic heterogeneity. Risk, II.	4
Identification of Circulating Tumor DNA for the Early Detection of Small-cell Lung Cancer. || Biomarkers, Tumor Case-Control Studies DNA, Neoplasm Early Detection of Cancer Female Humans Leukocytes Lung Neoplasms Male Mutation Neoplasm Staging Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a key potential biomarker for post-diagnosis surveillance but it may also play a crucial role in the detection of pre-clinical cancer. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an excellent candidate for early detection given there are no successful therapeutic options for late-stage disease, and it displays almost universal inactivation of TP53. We assessed the presence of TP53 mutations in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from the plasma of 51 SCLC cases and 123 non-cancer controls. We identified mutations using a pipeline specifically designed to accurately detect variants at very low fractions. We detected TP53 mutations in the cfDNA of 49% SCLC patients and 11.4% of non-cancer controls. When stratifying the 51 initial SCLC cases by stage, TP53 mutations were detected in the cfDNA of 35.7% early-stage and 54.1% late-stage SCLC patients. The results in the controls were further replicated in 10.8% of an independent series of 102 non-cancer controls. The detection of TP53 mutations in 11% of the 225 non-cancer controls suggests that somatic mutations in cfDNA among individuals without any cancer diagnosis is a common occurrence, and poses serious challenges for the development of ctDNA screening tests.	4
p53-dependent Nestin regulation links tumor suppression to cellular plasticity in liver cancer. || Animals Carcinoma, Hepatocellular Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Hepatocytes Humans Liver Neoplasms Mice Nestin Prognosis Sp1 Transcription Factor Sp3 Transcription Factor Transcription, Genetic Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || The p53 tumor suppressor coordinates a series of antiproliferative responses that restrict the expansion of malignant cells, and as a consequence, p53 is lost or mutated in the majority of human cancers. Here, we show that p53 restricts expression of the stem and progenitor-cell-associated protein nestin in an Sp1/3 transcription-factor-dependent manner and that Nestin is required for tumor initiation in vivo. Moreover, loss of p53 facilitates dedifferentiation of mature hepatocytes into nestin-positive progenitor-like cells, which are poised to differentiate into hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) or cholangiocarcinomas (CCs) in response to lineage-specific mutations that target Wnt and Notch signaling, respectively. Many human HCCs and CCs show elevated nestin expression, which correlates with p53 loss of function and is associated with decreased patient survival. Therefore, transcriptional repression of Nestin by p53 restricts cellular plasticity and tumorigenesis in liver cancer.	0
Phenotypic diversity identified by cardiac magnetic resonance in a large hypertrophic cardiomyopathy family with a single MYH7 mutation. || Adult Aged Asian Continental Ancestry Group Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Electrocardiography Female Genetic Association Studies Genotype Heart Humans Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Male Middle Aged Mutation Myocardium Myosin Heavy Chains Pedigree Phenotype || Limited data is available on phenotypic variations with the same genotype in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The present study aims to explore the relationship between genotype and phenotype characterized by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in a large Chinese family. A proband diagnosed with HCM from a multigenerational family underwent next-generation sequencing based on a custom sureSelect panel, including 117 candidate pathogenic genes associated with cardiomyopathies. All genetic results were confirmed by the Sanger sequencing method. All confirmed mutation carriers underwent CMR exam and myocardial tissue characterization using T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on a 3T scanner (Siemens Trio, Gemany). After clinical and genetic screening of 36 (including the proband) members of a large Chinese family, nineteen family members are determined to carry the single p.T1377M (c.4130C>T) mutation in the MYH7 gene. Of these 19 mutation carriers, eight are diagnosed with HCM, one was considered as borderline affected and ten are not clinically or phenotypically affected. Different HCM phenotypes are present in the nine affected individuals in this family. In addition, we have found different tissue characteristics assessed by T1 mapping and LGE in these individuals. We describe a family that demonstrates the diverse HCM phenotypes associated with a single MYH7 mutation.	4
A double mutation of the ryanodine receptor type 1 gene in a malignant hyperthermia family with multiminicore myopathy. ||  || At least 100 Ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) mutations associated with malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) have been identified, but 2 RYR1 mutations accompanying multiminicore myopathy in an MH and/or CCD family have been reported only rarely. Fifty-three members of a large MH family were investigated with clinical, histopathologic, RYR1 mutation, and haplotyping studies. Blood creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels were also measured where possible. Sequencing of the entire RYR1 coding region identified a double RYR1 mutation (R2435H and A4295V) in MH/CCD regions 2 and 3. Haplotyping analysis revealed that the two missense heterozygous mutations (c.7304G>A and c.12891C>T) were always present on a common haplotype allele, and were closely cosegregated with histological multiminicores and elevated serum CK. All the subjects with the double mutation showed elevated serum CK and myoglobin, and the obtained muscle biopsy samples showed multiminicore lesions, but only two family members presented a late-onset, slowly progressive myopathy. We found multiminicore myopathy with clinical and histological variability in a large MH family with an unusual double RYR1 mutation, including a typical CCD-causing known mutant. These results suggest that multiminicore lesions are associated with the presence of more than two mutations in the RYR1 gene.	4
Glycerol increases the yield and activity of human phenylalanine hydroxylase mutant enzymes produced in a prokaryotic expression system. || Amino Acid Substitution Blotting, Western Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel Escherichia coli Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic Glycerol Humans Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Recombinant Proteins || Chemical chaperones are low molecular weight compounds known to stabilize proteins in vitro. Recently it was shown that, in transfected cells, these molecules can also correct the defective folding of some mutant proteins. Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) has been proposed to be classified as a "conformational disease," since it has been shown that the majority of the PAH mutations affect protein folding, thereby causing an increasing tendency toward aggregation and proteolytic degradation. Based on these observations, the effect of glycerol as a stabilizer agent of recombinant mutant forms of human phenylalanine hydroxylase enzymes (hPAH) produced in a prokaryotic expression system was investigated. The wild-type and two mutant forms of the hPAH protein (R270K and V388M) were expressed in the presence of glycerol in the culture medium. The yield, specific enzymatic activities, and kinetic properties of the recombinant proteins were determined and compared with the data obtained under normal growth conditions. The results obtained demonstrate that glycerol not only improved the yield of the soluble hPAH proteins (2- to 3-fold depending on the mutant enzyme) produced but also increased the specific activity of the purified recombinant enzymes. We speculate that correction of protein folding abnormalities by chemical chaperones may be a possible therapeutic approach to correct conformational diseases.	0
Clinical versus molecular diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in the diverse South African population. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic disease characterised by strikingly elevated plasma cholesterol concentration, which can lead to premature coronary death if left untreated. In this study DNA diagnosis of FH, which allows detection before onset of clinical symptoms, was evaluated against biochemical parameters routinely used to identify subjects with FH. A population-based strategy was used to identify low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene defects in South Africans with clinical signs of FH, followed by a family-based DNA screening approach for presymptomatic diagnosis of FH. DNA screening of 790 at-risk relatives for the FH-related mutations identified in 379 index cases, allowed accurate disease diagnosis in an additional 338 relatives and exclusion of the relevant mutation in 452 individuals. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis, based on total cholesterol values measured in family members of FH heterozygous index cases with one of the three founder-related mutations, D154N, D206E and V408M, were 89.3% and 81.9%, respectively. The predominance of 10 LDLR gene mutations in the local population justifies population-directed DNA diagnosis of FH in South Africa on a routine basis, particularly since expression of the defective gene measured in biochemical tests does not allow accurate diagnosis of FH in all cases. DNA testing provides a definitive tool for family tracing aimed at pre-clinical diagnosis and preventive treatment of FH.	4
Utility of BRAF V600E Immunohistochemistry Expression Pattern as a Surrogate of BRAF Mutation Status in 154 Patients with Advanced Melanoma. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biomarkers, Tumor DNA Mutational Analysis Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Immunohistochemistry Male Melanoma Middle Aged Mutation Predictive Value of Tests Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Reproducibility of Results || Successful BRAF inhibitor therapy depends on the accurate assessment of the mutation status of the BRAF V600 residue in tissue samples. In melanoma, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis with monoclonal anti-BRAF V600E has emerged as a sensitive and specific surrogate of BRAF V600E mutation, particularly when BRAF V600E protein expression is homogeneous and strong. A subset of melanomas exhibit heterogeneous labeling for BRAF V600E, but our understanding of the significance of heterogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression is limited. We used next-generation sequencing to compare BRAF V600E IHC staining patterns in 154 melanomas: 79 BRAF(WT) and 75 BRAF (including 53 V600E) mutants. Agreement among dermatopathologists on tumor morphology, IHC expression, and intensity was excellent (ρ = 0.99). A predominantly epithelioid cell phenotype significantly correlated with the BRAF V600E mutation (P = .0085). Tumors demonstrating either heterogeneous or homogeneous IHC expression were significantly associated with the BRAF V600E mutation (P < .0001), as was increased intensity of staining (P < .0001). The positive predictive value was 98% for homogenous IHC expression compared with 70% for heterogeneous labeling. Inclusion of both heterogeneous and homogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression as a positive test significantly improved IHC test sensitivity from 85% to 98%. However, this reduced BRAF V600E IHC test specificity from 99% to 96%. Cautious evaluation of heterogeneous BRAF V600E IHC expression is warranted and comparison with sequencing results is critical, given its reduced test specificity and positive predictive value for detecting the BRAF V600E mutation.	4
Prediction of multiple hypermutable codons in the human PAH gene: codon 280 contains recurrent mutations in Quebec and other populations. ||  || The predicted mutability profile (MUTPRED) of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene shows that the 48 CpG sites (template and atemplate strands) are either empty of known mutations (7 sites), harbour "PKU" alleles involving CpG doublets (16 sites), or contain mutations that do not involve a C-->T or G-->A substitution in the doublet. These hypermutable sites harbour 32 different mutations in association with at least 66 different haplotypes and hyperphenylalaninemia. The E280K mutation in exon 7 of the PAH gene is a cause of phenylketonuria. It occurs on four different haplotypes in Europeans and on haplotypes 1 and 2 in Quebec. Whereas a single recombination event could explain the two haplotype associations in Quebec, the mutation does involve a CpG dinucleotide. By analyzing multiallelic markers 5' (STR) and 3' (VNTR) to the E280K allele on 12 mutant and 30 normal chromosomes, we conclude that recurrent mutation is the likely origin of E280K in Quebec. The PAH mutation database shows that the allele accounts for 1.5% of PKU chromosomes worldwide.	1 3
Impact of genetic variation on three dimensional structure and function of proteins. || Exome Genetic Variation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proteins Structure-Activity Relationship || The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://wwpdb.org) was established in 1971 as the first open access digital data resource in biology with seven protein structures as its initial holdings. The global PDB archive now contains more than 126,000 experimentally determined atomic level three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules (proteins, DNA, RNA), all of which are freely accessible via the Internet. Knowledge of the 3D structure of the gene product can help in understanding its function and role in disease. Of particular interest in the PDB archive are proteins for which 3D structures of genetic variant proteins have been determined, thus revealing atomic-level structural differences caused by the variation at the DNA level. Herein, we present a systematic and qualitative analysis of such cases. We observe a wide range of structural and functional changes caused by single amino acid differences, including changes in enzyme activity, aggregation propensity, structural stability, binding, and dissociation, some in the context of large assemblies. Structural comparison of wild type and mutated proteins, when both are available, provide insights into atomic-level structural differences caused by the genetic variation.	0
Germline and somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes predict platinum response and survival in ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinomas. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Antineoplastic Agents Carcinoma Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Fallopian Tube Neoplasms Female Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic Homologous Recombination Humans Middle Aged Mutation Ovarian Neoplasms Peritoneal Neoplasms Platinum Compounds || Hallmarks of germline BRCA1/2-associated ovarian carcinomas include chemosensitivity and improved survival. The therapeutic impact of somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and mutations in other homologous recombination DNA repair genes is uncertain. Using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, we assessed 390 ovarian carcinomas for germline and somatic loss-of-function mutations in 30 genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, and 11 other genes in the homologous recombination pathway. Thirty-one percent of ovarian carcinomas had a deleterious germline (24%) and/or somatic (9%) mutation in one or more of the 13 homologous recombination genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, FAM175A, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D. Nonserous ovarian carcinomas had similar rates of homologous recombination mutations to serous carcinomas (28% vs. 31%, P = 0.6), including clear cell, endometrioid, and carcinosarcoma. The presence of germline and somatic homologous recombination mutations was highly predictive of primary platinum sensitivity (P = 0.0002) and improved overall survival (P = 0.0006), with a median overall survival of 66 months in germline homologous recombination mutation carriers, 59 months in cases with a somatic homologous recombination mutation, and 41 months for cases without a homologous recombination mutation. Germline or somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes are present in almost one third of ovarian carcinomas, including both serous and nonserous histologies. Somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and mutations in other homologous recombination genes have a similar positive impact on overall survival and platinum responsiveness as germline BRCA1/2 mutations. The similar rate of homologous recombination mutations in nonserous carcinomas supports their inclusion in PARP inhibitor clinical trials.	4
Long Non-Coding RNAs Embedded in the Rb and p53 Pathways. ||  || In recent years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained significant attention as a novel class of gene regulators. Although a small number of lncRNAs have been shown to regulate gene expression through diverse mechanisms including transcriptional regulation, mRNA splicing and translation, the physiological function and mechanism of action of the vast majority are not known. Profiling studies in cell lines and tumor samples have suggested a potential role of lncRNAs in cancer. Indeed, distinct lncRNAs have been shown to be embedded in the p53 and Rb networks, two of the major tumor suppressor pathways that control cell cycle progression and survival. Given the fact that inactivation of Rb and p53 is a hallmark of human cancer, in this review we discuss recent evidence on the function of lncRNAs in the Rb and p53 signaling pathways.	0
Co-occurring PTPN11 and SOS1 gene mutations in Noonan syndrome: does this predict a more severe phenotype? || Child Female Heterozygote Humans Mutation Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 SOS1 Protein Sequence Analysis, DNA || Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, with variable phenotypic expression, characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphisms and heart disease. Different genes of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway are responsible for the syndrome, the most common are: PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS. The objective of this study was to report a patient with Noonan syndrome presenting mutations in two genes of RAS/MAPK pathway in order to establish whether these mutations lead to a more severe expression of the phenotype. We used direct sequencing of the PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, and KRAS genes. We have identified two described mutations in heterozygosity: p.N308D and p.R552G in the genes PTPN11 and SOS1, respectively. The patient has typical clinical features similar to the ones with NS and mutation in only one gene, even those with the same mutation identified in this patient. A more severe or atypical phenotype was not observed, suggesting that these mutations do not exhibit an additive effect.	4
