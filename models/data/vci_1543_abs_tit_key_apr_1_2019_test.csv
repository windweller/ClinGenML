Diagnosis of families with familial hypercholesterolaemia and/or Apo B-100 defect by means of DNA analysis of LDL-receptor gene mutations. ||  || One major problem of using hypercholesterolaemia alone as a primary criterion for diagnosing familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is that 15-40% of relatives may be misdiagnosed because plasma lipid levels in FH heterozygotes overlap with those in the general population. General Hospital/University of Vienna, Department of Pediatrics, Outpatient lipid clinic. As a part of the MED-PED (make early diagnosis-prevent early death) project we are currently investigating children, adolescents and their relatives who are suspected to be affected with FH in our out-patient clinic for metabolic diseases using MED-PED inclusion criteria and confirming the diagnosis by means of DNA analysis. 263 patients with premature atherosclerosis and/or hypercholesterolaemia: 116 children (mean age 11.6 +/- 4.1 years; 57 girls and 59 boys) and 147 adults (64 women, mean age 41.5 +/- 13.7 years; 83 men, mean age 42.8 +/- 10.8 years). 119 patients with mutations have been detected; 56 children with either low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and/or ApoB mutations (27 girls and 29 boys; mean total cholesterol (TC) 275 +/- 71 mg/dl, triglycerides (TG) 101 +/- 57 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 49 +/- 12 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 198 +/- 67 mg/dl) and one boy with a homozygous. LDLR mutation. A further 62 adults with LDLR and/or ApoB mutations were documented; 33 women (mean age 36.9 +/- 11.1 years; mean TC 283 +/- 76 mg/dl, TG 137 +/- 78 mg/dl, HDL-C 55 +/- 17 mg/dl, LDL-C 210 +/- 67 mg/dl) and 29 men (mean age 45.0 +/- 10.6 years; mean TC 301 +/- 87 mg/dl, TG 163 +/- 112 mg/dl, HDL-C 42 +/- 12 mg/dl, LDL-C 233 +/- 83 mg/dl). In 32 of these subjects (11 children (21%), 21 adults (42%)), serum lipid levels were lower than the diagnostic MED-PED limits adopted, so that they might have been misclassified without an additional DNA analysis. In our study, diagnosis of FH and related disorders (ApoB-100 defect) by means of conventional laboratory methods missed at least 21% in children and 42% in adults affected with LDLR and/or ApoB gene mutations. Genetic FH diagnosis provides a tool for specific diagnosis of mutation carrier status.	4
Germline mutations of the PTEN gene in Cowden disease, an inherited breast and thyroid cancer syndrome. || Breast Neoplasms DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genes, Tumor Suppressor Germ-Line Mutation Hamartoma Syndrome, Multiple Humans Male PTEN Phosphohydrolase Pedigree Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases Polymorphism, Genetic Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Cowden disease (CD) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome associated with an elevated risk for tumours of the breast, thyroid and skin. Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) cosegregates with a subset of CD families and is associated with macrocephaly, ataxia and dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytomatosis. The common feature of these diseases is a predisposition to hamartomas, benign tumours containing differentiated but disorganized cells indigenous to the tissue of origin. Linkage analysis has determined that a single locus within chromosome 10q23 is likely to be responsible for both of these diseases. A candidate tumour suppressor gene (PTEN) within this region is mutated in sporadic brain, breast and prostate cancer. Another group has independently isolated the same gene, termed MMAC1, and also found somatic mutations throughout the gene in advanced sporadic cancers. Mutational analysis of PTEN in CD kindreds has identified germline mutations in four of five families. We found nonsense and missense mutations that are predicted to disrupt the protein tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatase domain of this gene. Thus, PTEN appears to behave as a tumour suppressor gene in the germline. Our data also imply that PTEN may play a role in organizing the relationship of different cell types within an organ during development.	2 3

Estimation of the genetic contribution of presenilin-1 and -2 mutations in a population-based study of presenile Alzheimer disease. || Aged Alzheimer Disease Female Humans Male Membrane Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic Presenilin-1 Presenilin-2 || Two closely related genes, the presenilins ( PS ), located at chromosomes 14q24.3 and 1q42.1, have been identified for autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) with onset age below 65 years (presenile AD). We performed a systematic mutation analysis of all coding and 5'-non-coding exons of PS -1 and PS -2 in a population-based epidemiological series of 101 unrelated familial and sporadic presenile AD cases. The familial cases included 10 patients of autosomal dominant AD families sampled for linkage analysis studies. In all patients mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene ( APP ) had previously been excluded. Four different PS -1 missense mutations were identified in six familial cases, two of which where autosomal dominant cases. Three mutations resulted in onset ages above 55 years, with one segregating in an autosomal dominant family with mean onset age 64 years (range 50-78 years). One PS -2 mutation was identified in a sporadic case with onset age 62 years. Our mutation data provided estimates for PS -1 and PS -2 mutation frequencies in presenile AD of 6 and 1% respectively. When family history was accounted for mutation frequencies for PS -1 were 9% in familial cases and 18% in autosomal dominant cases. Further, polymorphisms were detected in the promoter and the 5'-non-coding region of PS -1 and in intronic and exonic sequences of PS -2 that will be useful in genetic association studies.	4
Diagnosis of MODY in the offspring of parents with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. || Adolescent Blood Glucose Child Child, Preschool DNA-Binding Proteins Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Fasting Glucokinase Glucose Intolerance Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta Humans Hyperglycemia Mutation Nuclear Proteins Parents Transcription Factors || Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant monogenic form of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) representing 5% of youth-onset DM in the Caucasian population. In young adults the disease can be present as either non-insulin dependent or insulin-dependent DM. The diagnosis of this genetic disorder in children and adolescents is rare because of the mild glucose metabolism disorder at this time. We performed a metabolic, autoimmune and genetic study in 40 offspring of young parents affected by insulin-dependent DM (Group A) and in 35 offspring of young parents affected by early-onset non-insulin-dependent DM (Group B). Two children of Group A (5%) were found to be affected by fasting hyperglycemia and carry a GCK gene mutation that in one case was present also in the diabetic father. Eighteen offspring of Group B (51%) were positive for GCK or HNF-1alpha gene mutations present in the affected parents. All but two of these young patients had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Eleven of them were younger than 16 years. We conclude that screening for DM in youth should be extended to MODY in young families with both non-insulin-dependent and insulin-dependent DM. The sensitivity of the metabolic tests will precede the genetic diagnosis.	2
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Assay of Leukocyte Acid α-Glucosidase for Post-Newborn Screening Evaluation of Pompe Disease. || Adult Alleles Child Child, Preschool Chromatography, Liquid Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Leukocytes Neonatal Screening Tandem Mass Spectrometry alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease (PD) is the first lysosomal storage disorder to be added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel for newborn screening. This condition has a broad phenotypic spectrum, ranging from an infantile form (IOPD), with severe morbidity and mortality in infancy, to a late-onset form (LOPD) with variable onset and progressive weakness and respiratory failure. Because the prognosis and treatment options are different for IOPD and LOPD, it is important to accurately determine an individual's phenotype. To date, no enzyme assay of acid α-glucosidase (GAA) has been described that can differentiate IOPD vs LOPD using blood samples. We incubated 10 μL leukocyte lysate and 25 μL GAA substrate and internal standard (IS) assay cocktail for 1 h. The reaction was purified by a liquid-liquid extraction. The extracts were evaporated and reconstituted in 200 μL methanol and analyzed by LC-MS/MS for GAA activity. A 700-fold higher analytical range was observed with the LC-MS/MS assay compared to the fluorometric method. When GAA-null and GAA-containing fibroblast lysates were mixed, GAA activity could be measured accurately even in the range of 0%-1% of normal. The leukocyte GAA activity in IOPD (n = 4) and LOPD (n = 19) was 0.44-1.75 nmol · h-1 · mg-1 and 2.0-6.5 nmol · h-1 · mg-1, respectively, with no overlap. The GAA activity of pseudodeficiency patients ranged from 3.0-28.1 nmol · h-1 · mg-1, showing substantial but incomplete separation from the LOPD group. This assay allows determination of low residual GAA activity in leukocytes. IOPD, LOPD, and pseudodeficiency patients can be partially differentiated by measuring GAA using blood samples.	3 1
Phenotypic severity of homozygous GCK mutations causing neonatal or childhood-onset diabetes is primarily mediated through effects on protein stability. || Age of Onset Birth Weight Child Child, Preschool Diabetes Mellitus Enzyme Assays Enzyme Stability Female Genotype Glucokinase Homozygote Hot Temperature Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Kinetics Male Mutation, Missense Phenotype Recombinant Proteins Severity of Illness Index || Mutations in glucokinase (GCK) cause a spectrum of glycemic disorders. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations cause mild fasting hyperglycemia irrespective of mutation severity due to compensation from the unaffected allele. Conversely, homozygous loss-of-function mutations cause permanent neonatal diabetes requiring lifelong insulin treatment. This study aimed to determine the relationship between in vitro mutation severity and clinical phenotype in a large international case series of patients with homozygous GCK mutations. Clinical characteristics for 30 patients with diabetes due to homozygous GCK mutations (19 unique mutations, including 16 missense) were compiled and assigned a clinical severity grade (CSG) based on birth weight and age at diagnosis. The majority (28 of 30) of subjects were diagnosed before 9 months, with the remaining two at 9 and 15 years. These are the first two cases of a homozygous GCK mutation diagnosed outside infancy. Recombinant mutant GCK proteins were analyzed for kinetic and thermostability characteristics and assigned a relative activity index (RAI) or relative stability index (RSI) value. Six of 16 missense mutations exhibited severe kinetic defects (RAI ≤ 0.01). There was no correlation between CSG and RAI (r(2) = 0.05, P = 0.39), indicating that kinetics alone did not explain the phenotype. Eighty percent of the remaining mutations showed reduced thermostability, the exceptions being the two later-onset mutations which exhibited increased thermostability. Comparison of CSG with RSI detected a highly significant correlation (r(2) = 0.74, P = 0.002). We report the largest case series of homozygous GCK mutations to date and demonstrate that they can cause childhood-onset diabetes, with protein instability being the major determinant of mutation severity.	4
Myofilament protein gene mutation screening and outcome of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Actin Cytoskeleton Adult Aged Anticoagulants Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cardiovascular Diseases Carrier Proteins Cohort Studies Coronary Artery Bypass Endpoint Determination Female Genetic Testing Humans Kaplan-Meier Estimate Male Middle Aged Mutation Ultrasonography Warfarin || To determine the influence of a positive genetic test for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) on clinical outcome. A cohort of 203 unrelated patients with HCM (mean +/- SD age, 50+/-18 years) was enrolled from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003. They were followed up for a mean +/- SD time of 4.0+/-1.7 years after genetic testing of the 8 HCM-susceptibility genes that encode key sarcomeric/myofilament proteins. The clinical phenotype of those with a positive genetic test (myofilament-positive HCM) was compared with those with a negative genetic test (myofilament-negative HCM). In this cohort of 203 patients, 87 mutations were identified in 126 patients (myofilament-positive HCM, 62%); the remaining 77 patients (38%) were myofilament-negative. Despite similar baseline features, patients with myofilament-positive HCM showed increased risk of the combined end points of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, or progression to New York Heart Association class III or IV compared with the patients with myofilament-negative HCM (25% vs 7%, respectively; independent hazard ratio, 4.27; P=.008). These end points occurred at any age among patients with myofilament-positive HCM (range, 14-86 years), but only in those aged 65 years and older among patients with myofilament-negative HCM. Moreover, patients with myofilament-positive HCM showed greater probability of severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, defined as an ejection fraction of less than 50% and a restrictive filling pattern (P=.02 and P<.02, respectively, vs myofilament-negative HCM). Screening for sarcomere protein gene mutations in HCM identifies a broad subgroup of patients with increased propensity toward long-term impairment of left ventricular function and adverse outcome, irrespective of the myofilament (thick, intermediate, or thin) involved.	4
Functional study of GJB2 in hereditary hearing loss. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group Codon Connexin 26 Connexins Frameshift Mutation Gap Junctions Genes, Recessive HeLa Cells Hearing Disorders Humans Korea Mutation, Missense Polymerase Chain Reaction Transfection || The gene of the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26) was found to be the main causative gene of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB1). Although 35delG has been known as the major mutation in Western countries, 235delC was reported to be a specific form of mutation in Asian populations. The objective of the study was to identify how 235delC and E114G changes found in the Korean population affected the function of using molecular biological techniques. Genes containing 235delC and E114G were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector, and HeLa cells were transfected with the recombinant DNA samples by the liposome complex method. The expression and subcellular localization of Cx26 were determined, using antibodies against amino acid sequences in the intracellular loop (IL) and N-terminal (NT) portions of Cx26. To analyze functions of the as a gap junction channel, we examined Lucifer yellow dye transfer between cells with a scrape-loaded technique. Wild-type (WT) with normal hearing was used as a positive control, and mock transfected cells were used as a negative control. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that cells transfected with E114G and WT gave characteristic punctate patterns of reaction in the cell membrane with both antibodies. However, 235delC cells were not stained with anti-IL antibody but stained slightly just around the nucleus only with anti-NT antibody. In a functional study of, transfer of Lucifer yellow into contiguous cells was detected in both WT and E114G, but no transfer activity was observed in 235delC. The 235delC mutation showed a loss of targeting activity to the cell membrane and severe deterioration of gap junction activity. For the E114G, we did not find any difference from WT transfected cells.	0
Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer due to a previously undescribed CDH1 splice site mutation. || Alternative Splicing Antigens, CD Cadherins Humans Male Point Mutation Stomach Neoplasms || Our patient was a 52-year-old man who was diagnosed with signet ring cell gastric adenocarcinoma. An extensive family history of gastric cancer raised suspicion for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Sequencing of the patient's CDH1 gene revealed a novel point mutation in a strictly conserved splice site within intron 6, c.833-2 A > G. This mutation was predicted to result in loss of function due to defective RNA splicing. To characterize the pathogenic mechanism of this mutation, we amplified the patient's CDH1 gene products by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Primers flanking the region of the mutation detected 3 distinct transcripts. In addition to the wild-type product, a larger product consistent with activation of a cryptic splice site within intron 6 and a smaller product shown to result from exon 7 skipping were detected. In summary, we have identified a novel CDH1 mutation in a large hereditary diffuse gastric cancer kindred and identified its pathogenic mechanism.	2 4 0
Compound heterozygous or homozygous truncating MYBPC3 mutations cause lethal cardiomyopathy with features of noncompaction and septal defects. || Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Carrier Proteins DNA Mutational Analysis Echocardiography Electrocardiography Fatal Outcome Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heart Defects, Congenital Heart Septal Defects Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mutation || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is usually caused by autosomal dominant pathogenic mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric or sarcomere-associated cardiac muscle proteins. The disease mainly affects adults, although young children with severe HCM have also been reported. We describe four unrelated neonates with lethal cardiomyopathy, and performed molecular studies to identify the genetic defect. We also present a literature overview of reported patients with compound heterozygous or homozygous pathogenic MYBPC3 mutations and describe their clinical characteristics. All four children presented with feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and dyspnea. They died from cardiac failure before age 13 weeks. Features of left ventricular noncompaction were diagnosed in three patients. In the fourth, hypertrabeculation was not a clear feature, but could not be excluded. All of them had septal defects. Two patients were compound heterozygotes for the pathogenic c.2373dup p.(Trp792fs) and c.2827C>T p.(Arg943*) mutations, and two were homozygous for the c.2373dup and c.2827C>T mutations. All patients with biallelic truncating pathogenic mutations in MYBPC3 reported so far (n=21) were diagnosed with severe cardiomyopathy and/or died within the first few months of life. In 62% (13/21), septal defects or a patent ductus arteriosus accompanied cardiomyopathy. In contrast to heterozygous pathogenic mutations, homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating pathogenic MYBPC3 mutations cause severe neonatal cardiomyopathy with features of left ventricular noncompaction and septal defects in approximately 60% of patients.	4
Prevalence and spectrum of mutations in a cohort of 192 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cohort Studies Death, Sudden, Cardiac Female France Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Prevalence Sarcomeres Young Adult || Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), a common and clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by unexplained ventricular myocardial hypertrophy and a high risk of sudden cardiac death, is mostly caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes but modifiers genes may also modulate the phenotypic expression of HCM mutations. The aim of the current study was to report the frequency of single and multiple gene mutations in a large French cohort of HCM patients and to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms previously suggested to be potential disease modifiers in this myocardial pathology. We report the molecular screening of 192 unrelated HCM patients using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography/sequencing analysis of the MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNT2 and TNNI3 genes. Genotyping of 6 gene polymorphisms previously reported as putative HCM modifiers (5 RAAS polymorphisms and TNF-α -308 G/A) was also performed. Seventy-five mutations were identified in 92 index patients (48%); 32 were novel. MYBPC3 mutations (25%) represent the most prevalent cause of inherited HCM whereas MYH7 mutations (12%) rank second in the pathogenesis. The onset age was older in patients carrying MYBPC3 mutations than in those with MYH7 mutations. The MYBPC3 IVS20-2A>G splice mutation was identified in 7% of our HCM population. Multiple gene mutations were identified in 9 probands (5%), highlighting the importance of screening other HCM-causing genes even after a first mutation has been identified, particularly in young patients with a severe phenotype. No single or cumulative genetic modifier effect could be evidenced in this HCM cohort.	4
Myosin VIIA mutation screening in 189 Usher syndrome type 1 patients. ||  || Usher syndrome type 1b (USH1B) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital profound hearing loss, vestibular abnormalities, and retinitis pigmentosa. The disorder has recently been shown to be caused by mutations in the myosin VIIa gene (MYO7A) located on 11q14. In the current study, a panel of 189 genetically independent Usher I cases were screened for the presence of mutations in the N-terminal coding portion of the motor domain of MYO7A by heteroduplex analysis of 14 exons. Twenty-three mutations were found segregating with the disease in 20 families. Of the 23 mutations, 13 were unique, and 2 of the 13 unique mutations (Arg212His and Arg212Cys) accounted for the greatest percentage of observed mutant alleles (8/23, 31%). Six of the 13 mutations caused premature stop codons, 6 caused changes in the amino acid sequence of the myosin VIIa protein, and 1 resulted in a splicing defect. Three patients were homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for mutant alleles; these three cases were Tyr333Stop/Tyr333Stop, Arg212His-Arg302His/Arg212His-Arg302His, and IVS13nt-8c-->g/Glu450Gln. All the other USH1B mutations observed were simple heterozygotes, and it is presumed that the mutation on the other allele is present in the unscreened regions of the gene. None of the mutations reported here were observed in 96 unrelated control samples, although several polymorphisms were detected. These results add three patients to single case reported previously where mutations have been found in both alleles and raises the total number of unique mutations in MYO7A to 16.	1
The efficacy of microarray screening for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa in routine clinical practice. || Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genes, Recessive Genetic Testing High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis Retinitis Pigmentosa Retrospective Studies || To determine the efficacy of multiple versions of a commercially available arrayed primer extension (APEX) microarray chip for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). We included 250 probands suspected of arRP who were genetically analyzed with the APEX microarray between January 2008 and November 2013. The mode of inheritance had to be autosomal recessive according to the pedigree (including isolated cases). If the microarray identified a heterozygous mutation, we performed Sanger sequencing of exons and exon-intron boundaries of that specific gene. The efficacy of this microarray chip with the additional Sanger sequencing approach was determined by the percentage of patients that received a molecular diagnosis. We also collected data from genetic tests other than the APEX analysis for arRP to provide a detailed description of the molecular diagnoses in our study cohort. The APEX microarray chip for arRP identified the molecular diagnosis in 21 (8.5%) of the patients in our cohort. Additional Sanger sequencing yielded a second mutation in 17 patients (6.8%), thereby establishing the molecular diagnosis. In total, 38 patients (15.2%) received a molecular diagnosis after analysis using the microarray and additional Sanger sequencing approach. Further genetic analyses after a negative result of the arRP microarray (n = 107) resulted in a molecular diagnosis of arRP (n = 23), autosomal dominant RP (n = 5), X-linked RP (n = 2), and choroideremia (n = 1). The efficacy of the commercially available APEX microarray chips for arRP appears to be low, most likely caused by the limitations of this technique and the genetic and allelic heterogeneity of RP. Diagnostic yields up to 40% have been reported for next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques that, as expected, thereby outperform targeted APEX analysis.	4
Melanocortin 4 receptor gene variation is associated with severe obesity in Pima Indians. || Adult Arizona Body Mass Index Codon Female Genetic Carrier Screening Genetic Variation Humans Indians, North American Male Obesity Obesity, Morbid Pedigree Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Reference Values || Heterozygous coding mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R) are the most common genetic causes of severe human obesity identified to date. To determine whether MC4R has a role in causing severe obesity in Pima Indians, we sequenced the coding region of this gene in 426 full-heritage, non-first-degree related, adult Pima Indians (300 severely obese and 126 nondiabetic nonobese control subjects). Three coding variations were detected as heterozygotes only in severely obese subjects. One variation, detected in three obese subjects, was a novel single-base insertion (A) at nucleotide 100, and it predicted a frameshift and premature STOP at codon 37. The second variant, detected in 10 obese subjects, predicted a previously identified arginine-to-glutamine substitution at codon 165, and the third variant, detected in one obese subject, predicted a novel glycine-to-serine substitution at codon 231. Three polymorphisms were also identified in the 5' untranslated region, but these variants were detected in both obese and lean subjects and had similar allele frequencies. We conclude that variations in MC4R may account for a small portion of obesity in Pima Indians, but they do not explain the overall high prevalence of obesity in this Native American population.	4
Trunk muscle involvement in late-onset Pompe disease: study of thirty patients. || Adult Aged Disease Progression Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Image Processing, Computer-Assisted Longitudinal Studies Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal Radiography Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed Torso Young Adult || Late-onset Pompe disease is characterized by progressive weakness involving proximal limb and respiratory muscles. Recently, treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been introduced partially improving patients' prognosis, but a standard consensus on when to start ERT is still lacking. There is also a lack of biomarkers related to the clinical progression of the disease. Here we used muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) to study the abdominal and paravertebral muscles of 30 late-onset Pompe patients at different stages of disease. We observed a selective pattern of muscle damage, with early involvement of the Multifidus muscle, followed by the Obliquus internus abdominis and Longissimus muscle. Some degree of trunk involvement on MRI occurred even in asymptomatic patients. Severity of muscle involvement in MRI correlated with patients' functional stage. We suggest that: (a) the combination of paravertebral and abdominal muscle involvement may serve as a useful tool in the diagnostic work-up of patients with a clinical suspicion of Pompe disease; (b) trunk abnormalities appear at very early stages of disease and even in asymptomatic patients, possibly "announcing" the onset of the disease and thus the need for a closer clinical follow-up.	3 1
Impaired binding of 14-3-3 to C-RAF in Noonan syndrome suggests new approaches in diseases with increased Ras signaling. || 14-3-3 Proteins Animals Binding Sites Cell Line Cercopithecus aethiops Crystallization Crystallography, X-Ray Green Fluorescent Proteins Humans Kinetics Microscopy, Confocal Models, Molecular Mutation Noonan Syndrome Phosphorylation Protein Binding Protein Structure, Tertiary Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Serine Signal Transduction Transfection ras Proteins || The Ras-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras-RAF-MAPK) pathway is overactive in many cancers and in some developmental disorders. In one of those disorders, namely, Noonan syndrome, nine activating C-RAF mutations cluster around Ser(259), a regulatory site for inhibition by 14-3-3 proteins. We show that these mutations impair binding of 14-3-3 proteins to C-RAF and alter its subcellular localization by promoting Ras-mediated plasma membrane recruitment of C-RAF. By presenting biophysical binding data, the 14-3-3/C-RAFpS(259) crystal structure, and cellular analyses, we indicate a mechanistic link between a well-described human developmental disorder and the impairment of a 14-3-3/target protein interaction. As a broader implication of these findings, modulating the C-RAFSer(259)/14-3-3 protein-protein interaction with a stabilizing small molecule may yield a novel potential approach for treatment of diseases resulting from an overactive Ras-RAF-MAPK pathway.	0
Longitudinal association of PCSK9 sequence variations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Amino Acid Substitution Apolipoproteins E Cholesterol, LDL Coronary Artery Disease Female Genotype Humans Longitudinal Studies Male Middle Aged Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Risk Factors Serine Endopeptidases || Mutations of PCSK9 are associated cross-sectionally with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, but little is known about their longitudinal association with LDL-C levels from young adulthood to middle age. We investigated the associations of 6 PCSK9 variants with LDL-C over 20 years in 1750 blacks and 1828 whites from the Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults study. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess longitudinal differences in LDL-C levels between genotype categories. For blacks, LDL-C levels at age 18 were significantly lower (P<0.001) among those with 3 genetic variants (L253F, C679X, and Y142X; 81.5 mg/dL) and A443T (95.5 mg/dL) compared with noncarriers (109.6 mg/dL). The difference in LDL-C levels from noncarriers tended to widen for those with the 3 variants only, by 0.24 mg/dL per year of age (P=0.14). For whites with the R46L variant, compared with noncarriers, LDL-C levels at age 18 were significantly lower (84.4 mg/dL versus 100.9 mg/dL; P<0.001), and the increase in LDL-C with age was similar to noncarriers. The 3 genetic variants and the A443T variant in black men were associated with lower carotid intima-media thickness and lower prevalence of coronary calcification measured at ages 38 to 50. Our results suggest that participants with several genetic variants of PCSK9 have persistently lower serum LDL-C levels than noncarriers from ages 18 to 50. Such long-term reduction in LDL-C levels is associated with reduced subclinical atherosclerosis burden in black men.	4
A Novel SHOC2 Variant in Rasopathy. || Abnormalities, Multiple Child, Preschool Facies Female Gene Expression Genetic Variation Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins MAP Kinase Signaling System Mutation Phenotype Protein Binding || Rasopathies are a group of genetic disorders caused by germline mutations in multiple genes of the Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway. The only previously identified missense mutation in SHOC2, a scaffold protein of the ERK1/2 pathway, led to Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. Here, we report a novel mutation in SHOC2(c.519G>A; p.M173I) that leads to a Rasopathy with clinical features partially overlapping those occurring in Noonan and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes. Studies to clarify the significance of this SHOC2 variant revealed that the mutant protein has impaired capacity to interact with protein phosphatase 1c (PP1c), leading to insufficient activation of RAF-1 kinase. This SHOC2 variant thus is unable to fully rescue ERK1/2 activity in cells depleted of endogenous SHOC2. We conclude that SHOC2 mutations can cause a spectrum of Rasopathy phenotypes in heterozygous individuals. Importantly, our work suggests that individuals with mild Rasopathy symptoms may be underdiagnosed.	0
Intrafamilial phenotypic variability in families with biallelic SLC26A4 mutations. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group Audiometry, Pure-Tone Child Child, Preschool Female Genotype Hearing Loss Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Membrane Transport Proteins Mutation Phenotype Polymerase Chain Reaction Republic of Korea Retrospective Studies Sulfate Transporters Vestibular Aqueduct || Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) and hearing loss are known to be caused by SLC26A4 mutations, but large phenotypic variability exists among patients with biallelic SLC26A4 mutations. Intrafamilial phenotypic variability was analyzed in multiplex EVA families carrying biallelic SLC26A4 mutations to identify the contribution of SLC26A4 mutations and other genetic or environmental factors influencing the clinical manifestations. Retrospective case series. Eleven multiplex Korean families with EVA and hearing loss that carry biallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene were included. Genetic analysis for SLC26A4 and other genes including FOXI1, FOXI1-DBD, and KCNJ10 was performed. The auditory and other phenotypes were compared among siblings with the same SLC26A4 mutations. The difference in the auditory phenotypes was identified between siblings in approximately half of the EVA families. Families with SLC26A4 mutations other than H723R homozygous mutations demonstrated more phenotypic variability, especially in those carrying IVS7-2A>G splice site mutation. Cochlear malformation was a consistent finding among siblings with the same SLC26A4 mutations. No mutation was identified in the FOXI1, FOXI1-DBD, and KCNJ10 genes in the tested families. The possibility of variability concerning auditory phenotype should be considered even within family members carrying the same SLC26A4 mutations when providing genetic counseling to multiplex EVA families. Mutations in the currently known genes associated with EVA other than SLC26A4 were not found to be responsible for the intrafamilial phenotypic variability. Modifier genes or environmental factors other than the currently known genes seem to play a role in the phenotypic expressions of EVA patients.	1
START, a double blind, placebo-controlled pharmacogenetic test of responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride in phenylketonuria patients. || Adult Alleles Biopterin Child, Preschool Dose-Response Relationship, Drug Double-Blind Method Enzyme Activation Female Genotype Humans Male Mutation Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || Sapropterin dihydrochloride, a synthetic tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), works as a chaperone of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) in phenylketonuria (PKU) to facilitate and stabilize folding of PAH into its most active conformation. No standard pharmacogenetic tests exist to identify responsive genotypes. Previous studies have failed to identify genotypes that consistently predict response; they are weakened by varied: 1) doses; 2) response definitions; 3) duration; 4) phenylalanine (PHE) test times during different protein catabolic states; 5) control of dietary PHE. START (sapropterin therapy actual response test) protocol is a double blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week clinical test that obviates the confounders aforementioned. START results were evaluated for response-genotype correlates and trends in molecular characteristics. Seventy-four patients completed START. Thirty-six patients (48.6%) responded, 55 patients' genotypes are known, 38 unique genotypes are present. Alleles consistently associated with response include Y414C (8/8 patients, 6 genotypes) and I65T (9/9 patients, 6 genotypes). The p.R408W mutation, in which substitution of straight chain arginine with bulky aromatic amine, tryptophan, at the crux of a strategic hinge site activating folding of PAH, amino acid sequence 408, was strongly associated with non-response (21/29 patients non-responsive, 12/17 genotypes non-responsive). Genotypes containing at least one allele with ≥25% residual activity compared to wild type, were strongly associated with response. The START protocol provides a rigorous pharmacogenetic test to identify sapropterin responsiveness and genotypes associated with responsiveness and non-responsiveness. Some genotypes were found to be predictive of responsiveness or non-responsiveness, and responsiveness was associated with specific alleles. The START protocol provides a reliable test for sapropterin responsiveness and will continue to improve understanding of how PKU mutations impact PAH protein-folding dynamics and enhance understanding of PKU disease and its management.	3 1
Alterations in protein aggregation and degradation due to mild and severe missense mutations (A104D, R157N) in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH). ||  || Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine; its activity is the major determinant of phenylalanine disposal. Mutations in the corresponding human gene (PAH), which encodes the human hepatic PAH enzyme, result in hyperphenylalaninemia; the resulting phenotypes can range in severity from mild forms of hyperphenylalaninemia with benign outcome to the severe form, phenylketonuria with impaired cognitive development. This paper describes the detailed characterization of two inherited recessive missense mutations in PAH, c.311C-->A (A104D) and [c.470G-->A;c.471A-->C] (R157N), which are associated, respectively, in the homozygous or functionally hemizygous states, with mild and severe metabolic phenotypes. We used three different in vitro PAH expression systems (in Escherichia coli, cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and human embryonal kidney cells), as well as a unique assay for phenylalanine oxidation in vivo. In each system, we observed alterations of PAH function and physical properties, compared with wild-type enzyme, and differences in relative severity of effects between these two mutations. Pulse-chase experiments showed increased PAH degradation, probably related to observed aberrations in protein folding and altered oligomerization, as a basic mechanism underlying effects of these missense mutations.	3 0
Mutation Spectrum and Phenotypic Features in Noonan Syndrome with PTPN11 Mutations: Definition of Two Novel Mutations. || Child Female Genetic Association Studies Genotype Humans Male Mutation Noonan Syndrome Phenotype Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 || To evaluate the spectrum of PTPN11 gene mutations in Noonan syndrome patients and to study the genotype-phenotype associations. In this study, twenty Noonan syndrome patients with PTPN11 mutations were included. The patients underwent a detailed clinical and physical evaluation. To identify inherited cases, parents of all mutation positive patients were analyzed. Thirteen different PTPN11 mutations, two of them being novel, were detected in the study group. These mutations included eleven missense mutations: p.G60A, p.D61N, p.Y62D, p.Y63C, p.E69Q, p.Q79R, p.Y279C,p.N308D, p.N308S, p.M504V, p.Q510R and two novel missense mutations: p.I56V and p.I282M. The frequency of cardiac abnormalities and short stature were found to be 80 % and 80 %, respectively. Mental retardation was not observed in patients having exon 8 mutations. No significant correlations were detected between other phenotypic features and genotypes. By identifying genotype-phenotype correlations, this study provides information on phenotypes observed in NS patients with different PTPN11 mutations.	2 4
A novel non-synonymous mutation in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) in a 2-year-old Austrian girl with extreme obesity. || Adolescent Adult Animals Anticarcinogenic Agents Austria Body Fat Distribution Bone Density COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops Child Child, Preschool Female Gene Expression Glucose Tolerance Test Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Obesity, Morbid Pedigree Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Signal Transduction alpha-MSH || Functionally relevant mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene ( MC4R) currently display the most common major gene/allele effect on extreme obesity. Mutation screen of the MC4R in consecutively ascertained Austrian children and adolescents with severe obesity, to analyse the phenotype of mutation carriers and to functionally characterise novel mutations. 102 unrelated extremely obese children and adolescents (mean BMI 33.5+/-7.1 kg/m(2), >97th centile; mean age 13.8+/-4.1 yr) and 109 parents (79 mothers/30 fathers) of 88 of these patients were studied. The MC4R coding region was screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC); PCR products of aberrant dHPLC pattern were re-sequenced. Signal transduction properties of mutant MC4R was investigated by challenge with the highly potent agonist NDP-alpha-MSH. Cell surface expression was determined by ELISA. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) was applied to a 2.3 year old index patient. Body fat and bone mineral content were assessed in three of the five mutation carriers by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was applied to some mutation carriers. Heterozygous carriers of two non-synonymous mutations, two polymorphisms and a silent variation were identified within the study group. (1) A novel MC4R non-synonymous mutation (S136F) was detected in a 2.3 year old girl with extreme obesity (BMI 33.2 kg/m(2), >99th centile); (2) a previously described non-synonymous mutation (V253I) was identified in an obese mother (BMI 28.1 kg/m(2)) who did not transmit this mutation to her extremely obese son; (3) two known polymorphisms (V103I and I251L) were also identified; and (4) one obese mother was carrier of a silent variation (c.594C>T; I198). Co-segregation of S136F with the obesity phenotype was shown for three generations. IN VITRO functional studies revealed a complete loss of signal transduction activity of the mutant receptor while cell surface expression was only slightly reduced compared to the wild-type receptor. We detected a novel non-synonymous mutation (S136F) that leads to a complete loss of MC4R function IN VITRO.	2 4
Dilative arteriopathy and basilar artery dolichoectasia complicating late-onset Pompe disease. || Adult Age of Onset Basilar Artery Dilatation, Pathologic Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged Radiography Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency || Strokes related to intracranial aneurysm or arteriopathy have been reported in a few patients with late-onset Pompe disease. These reports suggested that cerebral vessel involvement could be an underrecognized complication of this disease. We report cerebral artery involvement in three French patients with late-onset Pompe disease. The first patient died at age 35 years from complications of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the basilar artery, and her 34-year-old sister showed evidence of dolichoectatic basilar artery on magnetic resonance angiography. A dilative arteriopathy complicated with carotid artery dissection was diagnosed in the third patient, aged 50 years. Two patients are currently being treated with enzyme replacement therapy (alglucosidase alfa), and regular angiographic follow-up showed the absence of progression of vascular abnormalities in one of them. These observations, combined with previously reported cases, confirm that Pompe disease should be recognized as a predisposing condition to dilative arteriopathy and cerebral aneurysm formation, although the real incidence of these vascular complications remains unknown.	1
Allelic variants of the Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene in a South African study group. ||  || Obesity is a global epidemic that results in significant morbidity and mortality. Mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene, which codes for a G-protein-coupled receptor responsible for postprandial satiety signaling, have been associated with monogenic obesity. The prevalence of obesity is on the increase in South Africa, and it is hypothesized that mutations in MC4R are a contributing factor. The aim of this study was to perform a retrospective assessment of the relationship between allelic variants of MC4R and BMI in a South African study cohort. DNA was isolated from a demographically representative cohort of 297 individuals and the entire MC4R gene sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Eight previously reported MC4R variants were identified in 42 of the 297 (14.1%) study participants. The most frequently observed MC4R alleles were V103I (4.0%), I170V (1.5%), and I198I (1.2%), while the remaining five variants together constituted 1.18%. Five compound heterozygotes were also detected. Although MC4R variants were rare, the majority of variation was observed in individuals of Black African ancestry. No statistically significant associations with BMI were reported. Given that lifestyle interventions have limited success in decreasing obesity, there is an urgent need to perform large-scale population studies to further elucidate the molecular underpinnings of this disease.	4
Burden of rare sarcomere gene variants in the Framingham and Jackson Heart Study cohorts. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cardiovascular Diseases Cohort Studies Female Genetic Variation Humans Male Middle Aged Models, Cardiovascular Risk Factors Sarcomeres || Rare sarcomere protein variants cause dominant hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. To evaluate whether allelic variants in eight sarcomere genes are associated with cardiac morphology and function in the community, we sequenced 3,600 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohorts. Out of the total, 11.2% of individuals had one or more rare nonsynonymous sarcomere variants. The prevalence of likely pathogenic sarcomere variants was 0.6%, twice the previous estimates; however, only four of the 22 individuals had clinical manifestations of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Rare sarcomere variants were associated with an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio: 2.3) in the FHS cohort, suggesting that cardiovascular risk assessment in the general population can benefit from rare variant analysis.	4
Crystal structure of the PTEN tumor suppressor: implications for its phosphoinositide phosphatase activity and membrane association. || Amino Acid Sequence Animals Binding Sites Caenorhabditis elegans Computer Graphics Crystallography, X-Ray Drosophila Genes, Tumor Suppressor Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositols Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases Protein Structure, Secondary Sequence Alignment Sequence Homology, Amino Acid Tumor Suppressor Proteins Xenopus || The PTEN tumor suppressor is mutated in diverse human cancers and in hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. PTEN is a phosphatase that can act on both polypeptide and phosphoinositide substrates in vitro. The PTEN structure reveals a phosphatase domain that is similar to protein phosphatases but has an enlarged active site important for the accommodation of the phosphoinositide substrate. The structure also reveals that PTEN has a C2 domain. The PTEN C2 domain binds phospholipid membranes in vitro, and mutation of basic residues that could mediate this reduces PTEN's membrane affinity and its ability to suppress the growth of glioblastoma tumor cells. The phosphatase and C2 domains associate across an extensive interface, suggesting that the C2 domain may serve to productively position the catalytic domain on the membrane.	0
Significance of genotype in tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive phenylketonuria. ||  || The value of genotyping to identify tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive (BH(4)-responsive) patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is a matter of debate. We reviewed 250 cases of patients with PAH deficiency, using published data from 198 cases and unpublished data from 52 cases of patients attending our own clinic. Patients underwent analyses for BH(4) load and genetic mutations. Partial and full BH(4) responses were defined as a 10-29% decrease and a >or=30% decrease from baseline in blood phenylalanine levels, respectively. BH(4)-responsive alleles were identified from BH(4)-responsive patients as either homozygous for a specific allele or compound heterozygous for that allele with a null mutation. Most inconsistencies between observed genotype and BH(4) response were associated with mutations in the regulatory domain of PAH (p.R68S, p.I65T, p.L48S and p.F39C), where 20/62 alleles (32.2%) were non-responsive. In the catalytic domain (mutations p.Y414C, p.R261Q, p.E390G, p.A300S, p.R241C, p.A403V and p.V388M), only 8/125 alleles (6.4%) were non-responsive. Seven patients had a genotype with two BH(4)-responsive alleles resulting in no response or only a partial response to BH(4). Ten patients had identical genotypes but inconsistent responses in BH(4) load. These results show that BH(4) non-responsiveness is associated with genotype. However, patients with mutations in the regulatory domain show inconsistent results. In patients with two responsive alleles, non-responsiveness may be related to negative inter-allelic complementation. In patients with the same genotype and inconsistent results for BH(4) load, external factors such as intestinal absorption of BH(4), catabolic conditions or other genetic factors may be responsible. Further in vitro studies are necessary to clarify the genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with BH(4)-responsive PKU.	3 1
Low density lipoprotein receptor founder mutations in Afrikaner familial hypercholesterolaemic patients: a comparison of two geographical areas. || Alleles Apolipoproteins B Base Sequence Heterozygote Homozygote Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Receptors, LDL South Africa || Afrikaners with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) were screened for the presence of three point mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene that were previously described as being relatively common in this population. The prevalence and distribution of the mutations were compared in 27 unrelated homozygous and 79 unrelated heterozygous FH Afrikaner patients from two regions in South Africa, the Transvaal and Cape Provinces. The relative distribution of the three mutations was similar in the two regions, with the FH1 mutation being the most prevalent (66%), followed by the FH2 mutation (27%) and the FH3 mutation (7%). Interestingly, defects other than the three common mutations are more common in the Cape than in the Transvaal; thus the three known mutations account for 98% of FH alleles in the Transvaal and only 74% in the Cape Province. None of the patients carried the recently described familial defective apolipoprotein B100 mutation. These results establish that three "founder" mutant genes occur amongst the Afrikaner and are responsible for the overall high prevalence of FH in this population.	4
Targeted sequence capture and GS-FLX Titanium sequencing of 23 hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy genes: implementation into diagnostics. || Adult Aged Cardiomegaly Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Female Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Sequence Alignment Sequence Analysis, DNA Titanium || Genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathies poses a challenge. Multiple genes are involved but no clear genotype-phenotype correlations have been found so far. In the past, genetic evaluation for hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies was performed by sequential screening of a very limited number of genes. Recent developments in sequencing have increased the throughput, enabling simultaneous screening of multiple genes for multiple patients in a single sequencing run. Development and implementation of a next generation sequencing (NGS) based genetic test as replacement for Sanger sequencing. In order to increase the number of genes that can be screened in a shorter time period, we enriched all exons of 23 of the most relevant HCM and DCM related genes using on-array multiplexed sequence capture followed by massively parallel pyrosequencing on the GS-FLX Titanium. After optimisation of array based sequence capture it was feasible to reliably detect a large panel of known and unknown variants in HCM and DCM patients, whereby the unknown variants could be confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The rate of detection of (pathogenic) variants in both HCM and DCM patients was increased due to a larger number of genes studied. Array based target enrichment followed by NGS showed the same accuracy as Sanger sequencing. Therefore, NGS is ready for implementation in a diagnostic setting.	4
Evaluation of ACMG-Guideline-Based Variant Classification of Cancer Susceptibility and Non-Cancer-Associated Genes in Families Affected by Breast Cancer. || Adult Aged Biomarkers, Tumor Breast Neoplasms Computational Biology Exome Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genetic Variation Genomics Guidelines as Topic High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Middle Aged Mutation Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Sequencing tests assaying panels of genes or whole exomes are widely available for cancer risk evaluation. However, methods for classification of variants resulting from this testing are not well studied. We evaluated the ability of a variant-classification methodology based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to define the rate of mutations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 180 medically relevant genes, including all ACMG-designated reportable cancer and non-cancer-associated genes, in individuals who met guidelines for hereditary cancer risk evaluation. We performed whole-exome sequencing in 404 individuals in 253 families and classified 1,640 variants. Potentially clinically actionable (likely pathogenic [LP] or pathogenic [P]) versus nonactionable (VUS, likely benign, or benign) calls were 95% concordant with locus-specific databases and Clinvar. LP or P mutations were identified in 12 of 25 breast cancer susceptibility genes in 26 families without identified BRCA1/2 mutations (11%). Evaluation of 84 additional genes associated with autosomal-dominant cancer susceptibility identified LP or P mutations in only two additional families (0.8%). However, individuals from 10 of 253 families (3.9%) had incidental LP or P mutations in 32 non-cancer-associated genes, and 9% of individuals were monoallelic carriers of a rare LP or P mutation in 39 genes associated with autosomal-recessive cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, 95% of individuals had at least one VUS. In summary, these data support the clinical utility of ACMG variant-classification guidelines. Additionally, evaluation of extended panels of cancer-associated genes in breast/ovarian cancer families leads to only an incremental clinical benefit but substantially increases the complexity of the results.	4
Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: molecular epidemiology and predictable BH4-responsiveness in South Portugal PKU patients. || Biopterin Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Association Studies Haplotypes Humans Molecular Epidemiology Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Portugal || Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA, OMIM #261600), which includes phenylketonuria (PKU), is caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), being already described more than 600 different mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlation is a useful tool to predict the metabolic phenotype, to establish the better tailored diet and, more recently, to assess the potential responsiveness to BH(4) therapy, a current theme on PKU field. The aim of this study was the molecular analysis of the PAH gene, evaluation of genotype-phenotype relationships and prediction of BH(4)-responsiveness in the HPA population living in South Portugal. We performed the molecular characterization of 83 HPA patients using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples or Guthrie cards. PAH mutations were scanned by PCR amplification of exons and related intronic boundaries, followed by direct sequence analysis. Intragenic polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP analysis. The results allowed the full characterization of 67 patients. The mutational spectrum encompasses 34 distinct mutations, being the most frequent IVS10nt-11G>A (14.6%), V388M (10.8%), R261Q (8.2%) and R270K (7.6%), which account for 46% of all mutant alleles. Moreover, 12 different haplotypes were identified and most mutations were associated with a single one. Notably, more than half of the 34 mutations belong to the group of more than 70 mutations already identified in BH(4)-responsive patients, according to BIOPKU database. Fifty one different genotypic combinations were found, most of them in single patients and involving a BH(4)-responsive mutation. In conclusion, a significant number (30-35%) of South Portugal PKU patients may potentially benefit from BH(4) therapy which, combined with a less strict diet, or eventually in special cases as monotherapy, may contribute to reduce nutritional deficiencies and minimize neurological and psychological dysfunctions.	3 1
Phenylketonuria genotypes correlated to metabolic phenotype groups in Norway. || Child Child, Preschool Family Health Female Gene Expression Genotype Humans In Vitro Techniques Infant Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Norway Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias || In order to establish a genotype-phenotype relationship, we have identified both mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genes in 108 phenylketonuria (PKU) patients (27 different alleles, 54 different genotypes). One major group of patients with very high pretreatment phenylalanine values ("classical" PKU) exclusively comprised homozygotes of the PKU mutations I65T, G272X, F299C, Y356X, R408W, IVS12nt1, and compound heterozygotes of various combinations of these alleles with G46S, R261Q, R252W, A259T, R158Q, D143G, R243X, E280K, or Y204C. A second major group of patients with lower phenylalanine values ("mild" PKU) comprised mutations A300S, R408Q, Y414C in various compound heterozygous states, and R261Q, R408Q, Y414C in homozygotes. The phenylalanine values in these groups were non-overlapping. In addition, a smaller group of patients formed the transition between the two main groups. In sib pairs 4 of 15 had discordant pretreatment phenylalanine values. Our results are consistent with the view that allelic heterogeneity at the PAH locus dominates the biochemical phenotype in PKU and that genotype information is able to predict the metabolic phenotype in PKU patients.	3 1
Germline KRAS mutations cause aberrant biochemical and physical properties leading to developmental disorders. || Animals COS Cells Cercopithecus aethiops Developmental Disabilities Ectodermal Dysplasia Facies Failure to Thrive GTPase-Activating Proteins Germ-Line Mutation Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Models, Molecular Noonan Syndrome Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction ras Proteins || The KRAS gene is the most common locus for somatic gain-of-function mutations in human cancer. Germline KRAS mutations were shown recently to be associated with developmental disorders, including Noonan syndrome (NS), cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), and Costello syndrome (CS). The molecular basis of this broad phenotypic variability has in part remained elusive so far. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the biochemical and structural features of ten germline KRAS mutations using physical and cellular biochemistry. According to their distinct biochemical and structural alterations, the mutants can be grouped into five distinct classes, four of which markedly differ from RAS oncoproteins. Investigated functional alterations comprise the enhancement of intrinsic and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalyzed nucleotide exchange, which is alternatively accompanied by an impaired GTPase-activating protein (GAP) stimulated GTP hydrolysis, an overall loss of functional properties, and a deficiency in effector interaction. In conclusion, our data underscore the important role of RAS in the pathogenesis of the group of related disorders including NS, CFCS, and CS, and provide clues to the high phenotypic variability of patients with germline KRAS mutations.	4 0
Mutational analysis of the LDL receptor and APOB genes in Mexican individuals with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. || Adolescent Adult Aged Alleles Anticholesteremic Agents Apolipoproteins B Cholesterol DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genotype Homozygote Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Mexico Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Receptors, LDL Sequence Analysis, DNA || The goal of this project was to identify families with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) to facilitate early detection and treatment and to provide genetic counselling as well as to approximate the mutational diversity of ADH in Mexico. Mutational analysis of the LDLR and APOB genes in 62 index cases with a clinical and/or biochemical diagnosis of ADH was performed. Twenty-five mutations (24 LDLR, 1 APOB) were identified in 38 index cases. A total of 162 individuals with ADH were identified using familial segregation analysis performed in 269 relatives of the index cases. In addition, a novel PCSK9 mutation, c.1850 C>A (p.Ala617Asp), was detected. The LDLR mutations showed the following characteristics: (1) four mutations are novel: c.695 -1G>T, c.1034_1035insA, c.1586 G>A, c.2264_2273del; (2) the most common mutations were c.682 G>A (FH-Mexico), c.1055 G>A (FH-Mexico 2), and c.1090 T>C (FH-Mexico 3); (3) five mutations were identified in 3 or more apparently unrelated probands; (4) three mutations were observed in a true homozygous state; and (5) four index cases were compound heterozygous, and one was a carrier of two mutations in the same allele. These results suggest that, in Mexico, ADH exhibits allelic heterogeneity with 5 relatively common LDLR mutations and that mutations in the APOB gene are not a common cause of ADH. This knowledge is important for the genotype-phenotype correlation and for optimising both cholesterol lowering therapies and mutational analysis protocols. In addition, these data contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of ADH in Mexico.	4
The Predictive Value of Genetic Analyses in the Diagnosis of Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-Responsiveness in Chinese Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency Patients. || Adolescent Asian Continental Ancestry Group Biopterin Child Child, Preschool Female Genotype Humans Infant Male Mutation Phenylketonurias Predictive Value of Tests || Molecular characterization of PAH deficiency has been proven essential in establishing treatment options. We examine the diagnostic accuracy of two genetic assays to predict BH4 responsiveness: to determine whether the AV sum test or mutation-status assessment test can obviate the need for BH4 loading in Chinese patients. The overall predicted response in 346 patients was 31.65% by the AV sum test and 25.43% by the other assay; both percentages were lower than 51.06% derived from loading results in 94 patients. Responders were compound heterozygotes with definite BH4 responsive mutations, while non-responders had null/null ones; some consistently with specific mutations and genotypes. The sensitivity and specificity of the assays were 81.1% and 92.5% for the AV sum, and 82.9%, 97.3% for the other. An AV sum cutoff >2 has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90.9%, while the presence of at least one BH4 responsive mutation has a PPV of 97.1%. The two approaches showed good concordance. Our data confirmed that the mutation-status assessment has a higher diagnostic accuracy in predicting response for Chinese patients than the AV sum test. BH4-responsiveness may be predicted or excluded from patients' molecular characteristics to some extent, thus some patients may avoid the initial loading.	1
Engineering and Functional Characterization of Fusion Genes Identifies Novel Oncogenic Drivers of Cancer. || Animals Cell Line, Tumor Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Female Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Mice Mice, Nude Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Neoplasms Oncogene Fusion Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf || Oncogenic gene fusions drive many human cancers, but tools to more quickly unravel their functional contributions are needed. Here we describe methodology permitting fusion gene construction for functional evaluation. Using this strategy, we engineered the known fusion oncogenes, BCR-ABL1, EML4-ALK, andETV6-NTRK3, as well as 20 previously uncharacterized fusion genes identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. In addition to confirming oncogenic activity of the known fusion oncogenes engineered by our construction strategy, we validated five novel fusion genes involvingMET, NTRK2, andBRAF kinases that exhibited potent transforming activity and conferred sensitivity to FDA-approved kinase inhibitors. Our fusion construction strategy also enabled domain-function studies ofBRAF fusion genes. Our results confirmed other reports that the transforming activity ofBRAF fusions results from truncation-mediated loss of inhibitory domains within the N-terminus of the BRAF protein.BRAF mutations residing within this inhibitory region may provide a means for BRAF activation in cancer, therefore we leveraged the modular design of our fusion gene construction methodology to screen N-terminal domain mutations discovered in tumors that are wild-type at theBRAF mutation hotspot, V600. We identified an oncogenic mutation, F247L, whose expression robustly activated the MAPK pathway and sensitized cells to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. When applied broadly, these tools will facilitate rapid fusion gene construction for subsequent functional characterization and translation into personalized treatment strategies.Cancer Res; 77(13); 3502-12. ©2017 AACR.	0
{alpha}-Catenin mediates initial E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell recognition and subsequent bond strengthening. || Animals CHO Cells Cadherins Cell Adhesion Cricetinae Cricetulus Humans Immunoprecipitation Microscopy, Atomic Force Protein Binding RNA, Small Interfering Sensitivity and Specificity Transfection alpha Catenin || alpha-Catenin is essential in cadherin-mediated epithelium development and maintenance of tissues and in cancer progression and metastasis. However, recent studies question the conventional wisdom that alpha-catenin directly bridges the cadherin adhesion complex to the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, whether alpha-catenin plays a direct role in cadherin-dependent cell adhesion is unknown. Here, single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements in cells depleted of alpha-catenin or expressing the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer associated V832M E-cadherin germ-line missense mutation show that alpha-catenin plays a critical role in cadherin-mediated intercellular recognition and subsequent multibond formation within the first 300 ms of cell contact. At short contact times, alpha-catenin mediates a 30% stronger interaction between apposing E-cadherin molecules than when it cannot bind the E-cadherin-beta-catenin complex. As contact time between cells increases, alpha-catenin is essential for the strengthening of the first intercellular cadherin bond and for the ensuing formation of additional bonds between the cells, all without the intervention of actin. These results suggest that a critical decision to form an adhesion complex between 2 cells occurs within an extremely short time span and at a single-molecule level and identify a previously unappreciated role for alpha-catenin in these processes.	0
PIK3CA mutations and amplification in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas: relation to other genetic defects and clinicopathologic status of the tumors. || Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Carcinoma, Endometrioid Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Endometrial Hyperplasia Endometrial Neoplasms Female Gene Amplification Genes, ras Humans Middle Aged Mutation PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational beta Catenin || Alterations of the PIK3CA gene occur in endometrial carcinomas, but their role in the carcinogenesis of those malignancies is still poorly understood. In this study, PIK3CA mutations and amplification in 196 endometrioid endometrial carcinomas and 20 endometrial hyperplasias were assessed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), sequencing, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results were correlated with mutations in the PTEN, KRAS, and CTNNB1 genes and with the clinicopathologic parameters of the tumors. PIK3CA mutations were found in 39 (20%) carcinomas. Six new mutations were identified. No PIK3CA mutations were found in endometrial hyperplasias. PIK3CA amplification was observed in 24 (12.2%) carcinomas and in 2 (10%) hyperplasias. The PIK3CA mutations and amplifications (with the exception of 6 cases) occurred independently. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with PTEN mutations (P = .0414) and tended to be associated with CTNNB1 (P = .0833), but not with KRAS mutations. Conversely, the PIK3CA amplifications significantly negatively correlated with PTEN mutations (P = .0038) and did not coexist with CTNNB1 and KRAS mutations. The PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with poorly differentiated tumors (P = .0423). Interestingly, PIK3CA amplifications, but not mutations, were strongly associated with older age (≥63 years, P = .0018). Our data show that mutations and amplification of PIK3CA are significant genetic alterations in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas associated with adverse clinicopathologic parameters (grade and stage). These data also demonstrate that PIK3CA mutations cooperate with PTEN mutations, suggesting an additive effect to PTEN, whereas PIK3CA amplification can, as an isolated event, enable the development of those tumors. Moreover, for the first time, a possible role of PIK3CA amplification in initiation and progression of endometrial carcinomas in older women is suggested, but this preliminary suggestion requires further research.	3
Broad spectrum of Pompe disease in patients with the same c.-32-13T->G haplotype. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Haplotypes Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Internationality Male Middle Aged Mutation Prevalence Risk Assessment alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease (acid maltase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type II; OMIM 232300) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency due to mutations in the GAA gene. Progressive skeletal muscle weakness affects motor and respiratory functions and is typical for all forms of Pompe disease. Cardiac hypertrophy is an additional fatal symptom in the classic infantile subtype. c.-32-13T-->G is the most common mutation in adults. To delineate the disease variation among patients with this mutation and to define the c.-32-13T-->G haplotypes in search for genotype-phenotype correlations. We studied 98 compound heterozygotes with a fully deleterious mutation (11 novel mutations are described) and the common c.-32-13T-->G mutation. All patients were Caucasian. None had the classic infantile form of Pompe disease. The clinical course varied far more than anticipated (age at diagnosis <1 to 78 years; age at onset: <1 to 52 years). The acid alpha-glucosidase activities in a subset of patients ranged from 4 to 19.9 nmol/mg/h. Twelve different c.-32-13T-->G haplotypes were identified based on 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the GAA gene. In 76% of the cases, c.-32-13T-->G was encountered in the second most common GAA core haplotype (DHRGEVVT). In only one case was c.-32-13T-->G encountered in the major GAA core haplotype (DRHGEIVT). Patients with the same c.-32-13T-->G haplotype (c.q. GAA genotype) may manifest first symptoms at different ages, indicating that secondary factors may substantially influence the clinical course of patients with this mutation.	1
Mutants of glucokinase cause hypoglycaemia- and hyperglycaemia syndromes and their analysis illuminates fundamental quantitative concepts of glucose homeostasis. || Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Adenosine Triphosphate Blood Glucose Carrier Proteins Enzyme Activation Enzyme Stability Glucokinase Glucose Glutathione Transferase Homeostasis Humans Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia Insulin Models, Biological Mutation Proteins Recombinant Fusion Proteins Syndrome || Mutations of the glucokinase gene cause hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. A quantitative understanding of these defects of glucose homeostasis linked to the glucokinase gene was lacking. Therefore a database of kinetic variables of wild-type and 20 missense mutants of glucokinase was developed and used in mathematical modelling to predict the thresholds for glucose-stimulated insulin release. Recombinant human glucokinase was generated in E. coli. The k(cat), glucose S(0.5), ATP K(m), and Hill number of glucokinase were determined. Inhibition by Stearoyl CoA and glucokinase regulatory protein and thermal stability were assayed for all mutants kinetically similar to wild-type glucokinase. A mathematical model predicting the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release was constructed. This model is based on the two substrate kinetics of glucokinase and the kinetic variables of the database. It is assumed that both glucokinase gene alleles are equally expressed in beta-cells and that induction of glucokinase occurs as a function of basal blood glucose. Large changes, varying greatly between mutants were found in nearly all variables. Glucokinase flux at threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release was about 25 % of total phosphorylating potential in the normal beta-cell and this was used to predict thresholds for the mutant heterozygotes. Clinical data for maturity onset diabetes of the young type linked to the glucokinase gene and familial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia linked to the glucokinase gene and the glucokinase kinetic data of this study were used to test the model. The model predicts fasting blood glucose between 3 and 7 mmol/l in these cases. A kinetics database of wild-type and 20 mutants of glucokinase was developed. Many kinetic differences were found for the mutants. The mathematical model to calculate the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin release predicts fasting blood glucose between 3 and 7 mmol/l in subjects with glucokinase gene mutations.

Mutation of SHOC2 promotes aberrant protein N-myristoylation and causes Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. || Actins Cell Nucleus Cytoskeleton Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect Fluorescent Dyes Germ-Line Mutation Hair Humans Indoles Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Mutation Mutation, Missense Myristic Acid Noonan Syndrome || N-myristoylation is a common form of co-translational protein fatty acylation resulting from the attachment of myristate to a required N-terminal glycine residue. We show that aberrantly acquired N-myristoylation of SHOC2, a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein that positively modulates RAS-MAPK signal flow, underlies a clinically distinctive condition of the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous disorders family. Twenty-five subjects with a relatively consistent phenotype previously termed Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (MIM607721) shared the 4A>G missense change in SHOC2 (producing an S2G amino acid substitution) that introduces an N-myristoylation site, resulting in aberrant targeting of SHOC2 to the plasma membrane and impaired translocation to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. Expression of SHOC2(S2G) in vitro enhanced MAPK activation in a cell type-specific fashion. Induction of SHOC2(S2G) in Caenorhabditis elegans engendered protruding vulva, a neomorphic phenotype previously associated with aberrant signaling. These results document the first example of an acquired N-terminal lipid modification of a protein causing human disease.	0
DNA binding cooperativity of p53 modulates the decision between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. || Apoptosis Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Binding Sites Cell Cycle Cell Proliferation DNA DNA Damage Gene Expression Profiling Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic HCT116 Cells Humans Models, Molecular Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation Promoter Regions, Genetic Protein Conformation Time Factors Transfection Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || p53 limits the proliferation of precancerous cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. How the decision between survival and death is made at the level of p53 binding to target promoters remains unclear. Using cancer cell lines, we show that the cooperative nature of DNA binding extends the binding spectrum of p53 to degenerate response elements in proapoptotic genes. Mutational inactivation of cooperativity therefore does not compromise the cell-cycle arrest response but strongly reduces binding of p53 to multiple proapoptotic gene promoters (BAX, PUMA, NOXA, CASP1). Vice versa, engineered mutants with increased cooperativity show enhanced binding to proapoptotic genes, which shifts the cellular response to cell death. Furthermore, the cooperativity of DNA binding determines the extent of apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Because mutations, which impair cooperativity, are genetically linked to cancer susceptibility in patients, DNA binding cooperativity contributes to p53's tumor suppressor activity.	0
Mutation analysis of the PTEN / MMAC1 gene in Japanese patients with Cowden disease. ||  || Cowden disease (CD), also known as multiple hamartoma syndrome, is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome associated with high risk of breast and thyroid cancer. Recently, germline mutations in PTEN / MMAC1, which has nine exons encoding a dual specificity phosphatase with homology to tensin and auxilin, have been identified on chromosome 10q23 in some 40 to 80% of CD patients. Our polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of all coding regions identified five different mutations including four novel germline mutations among 5 of 12 unrelated Japanese CD patients. The novel findings included a missense mutation (G --> T) at nucleotide 1004 in exon 8 resulting in an arginine-to-leucine change at codon 335 (R335L), two novel splice-site mutations (209 + 1delGT and 209 + 1delGTAA) in intron 3, and insertion of G at nucleotide 632 in exon 6 (632insG). We also detected a nonsense mutation (C --> T) at nucleotide 697 producing R233X in exon 7, which has been reported previously. From reported phenotypic data concerning CD patients from five different families who had the R233X mutation, it may be suggested that R233X mutation correlates with macrocephaly. Although previous reports have implicated exon 5 as a "hot spot," we found no mutation in exon 5.	3
Screening of SLC26A4 (PDS) gene in Pendred's syndrome: a large spectrum of mutations in France and phenotypic heterogeneity. || Adolescent Adult Biological Transport Child Child, Preschool Female France Genetic Heterogeneity Goiter Hearing Loss Humans Male Mass Screening Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Sulfate Transporters Syndrome Vestibular Aqueduct || Sensorineural hearing defect and goiter are common features of Pendred's syndrome. The clinical diagnosis of Pendred's syndrome remains difficult because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of the thyroid signs. The identification of PDS as the causative gene allowed molecular screening and enabled a re-evaluation of the syndrome to identify potential diagnostic characteristics. This report presents the clinical and genotypic findings of 30 French families, for whom a diagnosis of Pendred's syndrome had been made. Twenty-seven families had at least one mutated allele. Twenty-eight different mutations were identified, 11 of which had never been previously reported. The main clinical characteristics were: early hearing loss, fluctuation in terms of during deafness evolution, and the presence of an enlarged vestibular aqueduct.	3 1
Cardiac myosin missense mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy in mouse models and depress molecular motor function. || Actins Animals Biomechanical Phenomena Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Disease Models, Animal Echocardiography Heterozygote Homozygote Mice Molecular Motor Proteins Mutant Proteins Mutation, Missense Myocardium Myocytes, Cardiac Protein Structure, Secondary || Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leads to heart failure, a leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Approximately 30% of DCM cases are genetic in origin, with some resulting from point mutations in cardiac myosin, the molecular motor of the heart. The effects of these mutations on myosin's molecular mechanics have not been determined. We have engineered two murine models characterizing the physiological, cellular, and molecular effects of DCM-causing missense mutations (S532P and F764L) in the alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain and compared them with WT mice. Mutant mice developed morphological and functional characteristics of DCM consistent with the human phenotypes. Contractile function of isolated myocytes was depressed and preceded left ventricular dilation and reduced fractional shortening. In an in vitro motility assay, both mutant cardiac myosins exhibited a reduced ability to translocate actin (V(actin)) but had similar force-generating capacities. Actin-activated ATPase activities were also reduced. Single-molecule laser trap experiments revealed that the lower V(actin) in the S532P mutant was due to a reduced ability of the motor to generate a step displacement and an alteration of the kinetics of its chemomechanical cycle. These results suggest that the depressed molecular function in cardiac myosin may initiate the events that cause the heart to remodel and become pathologically dilated.	0

Should patients with asymptomatic pompe disease be treated? A nationwide study in France. || Adult Aged Cohort Studies Creatine Kinase Electrocardiography Female France Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Lysosomal Storage Diseases Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Muscular Diseases Respiratory Function Tests Young Adult alpha-Glucosidases || Acid α-glucosidase deficiency, that is, Pompe disease, is a glycogenosis for which enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available. It is not known whether patients diagnosed at an asymptomatic stage should be treated to prevent progression of the disease. We investigated 7 patients with asymptomatic Pompe disease identified from the French Pompe registry. The patients had a mean age of 45 (range 24-75) years, a median follow-up duration of 2 (range 1-22) years, and normal clinical examination, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and echocardiography. All presented with at least 1 subclinical abnormality, including hyperCKemia, vacuolar myopathy, and muscle MRI abnormalities, suggesting that subclinical myopathy was present in all cases. Asymptomatic Pompe disease may remain clinically silent for decades, and affected patients should be monitored closely for overt myopathy using clinical examination, PFTs, and muscle MRI to determine when to start ERT.	3 1 4 0
Homozygous and heterozygous Arg614Cys mutations (1840C-->T) in the ryanodine receptor gene co-segregate with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in a German family. ||  || The determination of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH) by genetic investigation is a controversial issue because of the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. The requirement for such an approach in MH diagnosis is a strong correlation between MH-associated genetic abnormalities and phenotypic findings in the in vitro contracture test (IVCT). After a severe clinical MH crisis during general anaesthesia a patient was diagnosed by the IVCT in which susceptibility to MH was confirmed. Genetic screening for MH-related mutations in the RYR1 gene revealed the presence of a homozygous 1840C-->T base exchange (Arg614Cys substitution) in this patient. A specific search for this defect in 20 relatives led to the identification of a total of 11 Arg614Cys mutations. Of these, 10 were heterozygous (including both parents) and one was homozygous (sister). Further IVCTs were subsequently performed on the parents of the index patient, the homozygous sister and all relatives who did not carry the Arg614Cys in order to determine the genotype/phenotype correlation. After analysing these data, and because of the strong correlation between clinical, phenotypic, and genetic results in the index patient, we assigned the diagnosis 'MHS' to all the remaining Arg614Cys mutation carriers of that family without performing the IVCT.	2
Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the same mutation, different prognosis. Comparison of two families with a long follow-up. || Adolescent Adult Aged Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child Child, Preschool Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Phenotype Portugal Prognosis Protein Isoforms || The gene encoding the beta-myosin heavy chain is one of the most frequently implicated in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Several mutations have been identified and some genotype-phenotype relationships have been assumed, particularly with regard to prognosis. Nevertheless, phenotypic expression is variable even in affected members of the same family carrying the same mutation. We identified the Ile263Thr mutation in several members of two unrelated Portuguese families. Penetrance, clinical behavior and prognosis were quite different between the two families, particularly concerning the occurrence of sudden death. Additional factors probably exist which account for the differences found. The complexity of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy makes it difficult to accurately determine genotype-phenotype relationships, and the screening and comparison of large affected families carrying the same mutation is warranted.	2 4
HER2 activating mutations are targets for colorectal cancer treatment. || Afatinib Animals Antibodies, Monoclonal Antineoplastic Agents Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Colorectal Neoplasms Disease Models, Animal Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Epithelial Cells ErbB Receptors Humans Molecular Targeted Therapy Mucous Membrane Mutation Quinazolines Quinolines Receptor, ErbB-2 Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays || The Cancer Genome Atlas project identified HER2 somatic mutations and gene amplification in 7% of patients with colorectal cancer. Introduction of the HER2 mutations S310F, L755S, V777L, V842I, and L866M into colon epithelial cells increased signaling pathways and anchorage-independent cell growth, indicating that they are activating mutations. Introduction of these HER2 activating mutations into colorectal cancer cell lines produced resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab by sustaining MAPK phosphorylation. HER2 mutants are potently inhibited by low nanomolar doses of the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors neratinib and afatinib. HER2 gene sequencing of 48 cetuximab-resistant, quadruple (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA) wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) identified 4 PDXs with HER2 mutations. HER2-targeted therapies were tested on two PDXs. Treatment with a single HER2-targeted drug (trastuzumab, neratinib, or lapatinib) delayed tumor growth, but dual HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors produced regression of these HER2-mutated PDXs. HER2 activating mutations cause EGFR antibody resistance in colorectal cell lines, and PDXs with HER2 mutations show durable tumor regression when treated with dual HER2-targeted therapy. These data provide a strong preclinical rationale for clinical trials targeting HER2 activating mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer.	4
Analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in the Spanish population: mutation profile and association with intragenic polymorphic markers. || DNA Mutational Analysis Electrophoresis Ethnic Groups Gene Frequency Genetic Heterogeneity Genetic Markers Haplotypes Humans Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Genetic Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid Spain || The aim of this study was to characterize the phenylketonuria (PKU) alleles in the Spanish population, by both identifying the causative mutations and analyzing the RFLP haplotypes and the VNTR and short-tandem-repeat alleles associated with the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. We have investigated 129 independent mutant chromosomes, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing. Ninety percent of the alleles were identified, and a total of 40 different mutations were detected. The mutational spectrum includes seven previously unreported mutations: P122Q, D129G, P147S, D151G, A165T, S196fs, and P407S. Seven mutations represent 43% of the Spanish PKU alleles, the most common being IVS10nt-11g-->a (14.7%), I65T (8.5%), and V388M (6.2%). The remaining 33 mutations are rare. The mutation profile and relative frequencies are markedly different from those in northern Europe, also showing unique features compared with those in other, southern European populations. The association analysis with polymorphic markers in the PAH gene provides valuable information for population-genetic studies and investigation of the origins of the mutations. This study may serve as reference in the analysis of the contemporary distributions and frequencies of the PKU mutations in related populations, with particular relevance in Latin American countries.	3
Spectrum of mutations and phenotypic expression in patients with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia identified in Italy. || Adult Aged Alcohol Dehydrogenase Alleles Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, LDL Coronary Disease Female Genetic Association Studies Heterozygote Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Italy Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Reference Values Serine Endopeptidases Smoking Tendons Xanthomatosis || To determine the spectrum of gene mutations and the genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia (ADH) identified in Italy. The resequencing of LDLR, PCSK9 genes and a selected region of APOB gene were conducted in 1018 index subjects clinically heterozygous ADH and in 52 patients clinically homozygous ADH. The analysis was also extended to 1008 family members of mutation positive subjects. Mutations were detected in 832 individuals: 97.4% with LDLR mutations, 2.2% with APOB mutations and 0.36% with PCSK9 mutations. Among the patients with homozygous ADH, 51 were carriers of LDLR mutations and one was an LDLR/PCSK9 double heterozygote. We identified 237 LDLR mutations (45 not previously reported), 4 APOB and 3 PCSK9 mutations. The phenotypic characterization of 1769 LDLR mutation carriers (ADH-1) revealed that in both sexes independent predictors of the presence of tendon xanthomas were age, the quintiles of LDL cholesterol, the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and of receptor negative mutations. Independent predictors of CHD were male gender, age, the presence of arterial hypertension, smoking, tendon xanthomas, the scalar increase of LDL cholesterol and the scalar decrease of HDL cholesterol. We identified 13 LDLR mutation clusters, which allowed us to compare the phenotypic impact of different mutations. The LDL cholesterol raising potential of these mutations was found to vary over a wide range. This study confirms the genetic and allelic heterogeneity of ADH and underscores that the variability in phenotypic expression of ADH-1 is greatly affected by the type of LDLR mutation.	2 4
Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography: high throughput mutation screening in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and SNP genotyping in motor neurone disease. || Algorithms Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid DNA Mutational Analysis Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Membrane Proteins Motor Neuron Disease Mutation, Missense Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Receptors, Virus Ventricular Myosins || To evaluate the usefulness of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as a high throughput tool in: (1) DNA mutation detection in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), and (2) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and validation in sporadic motor neurone disease (MND). The coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of the cardiac beta myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) were screened by DHPLC for mutation identification in 150 unrelated patients diagnosed with FHC. One hundred and forty patients with sporadic MND were genotyped for the A67T SNP in the poliovirus receptor gene. All DHPLC positive signals were confirmed by conventional methods. Mutation screening of MYH7 covered 10 kb with a total of 5700 amplicons, and more than 6750 DHPLC injections were completed within 35 days. The causative mutation was identified in 14% of FHC cases, including seven novel missense mutations (L227V, E328G, K351E, V411I, M435T, E894G, and E927K). Genotyping of the A67T SNP was performed at two different temperatures both in MND cases and 280 controls. This coding SNP was found more frequently in MND cases (13.6%) than in controls (6.8%). Furthermore, 19 and two SNPs were identified in MYH7 and the poliovirus receptor gene, respectively, during DHPLC screening. DHPLC is a high throughput, sensitive, specific, and robust platform for the detection of DNA variants, such as disease causing mutations or SNPs. It enables rapid and accurate screening of large genomic regions.	4
Chromoendoscopy in combination with random biopsies does not improve detection of gastric cancer foci in CDH1 mutation positive patients. ||  || Background and study aims: Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HGGC), an autosomal dominant tumor-syndrome, accounts for 1 % to 3 % of gastric cancers worldwide. Presumably 30 % to 40 % of all patients fulfilling the clinical guidelines for HDGC are carriers of a pathogenic mutation in theCDH1 gene. Patients often show multiple foci of signet ring cell carcinoma at early age and are advised to undergo prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG). Our aim was to improve the endoscopic detection of HDGC by using an enhanced endoscopic protocol.Patient and methods: Patients with a provenCDH1 germline mutation identified in our institute were prospectively included. Patients were advised to undergo PTG and offered a baseline endoscopic examination prior surgery. Examination was performed by using high-resolution white-light endoscopy and pan-gastric chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine as dye combined with targeted and multiple random biopsies assessed by an expert histopathologist. Postoperative histopathology was compared with results from endoscopic biopsies.Results: Between September 2012 and November 2014 8 patients with a provenCDH1 germline mutation were included. We conducted 44 targeted (6.3/patient) and 225 random (32.1/patient) biopsies in 7 patients. We detected 1 gastric cancer by random biopsy (14 %). All other examinations showed no signs of cancer. Histopathology of gastrectomy specimen revealed multiple foci of gastric carcinoma in 6 patients (86 %) with a total number of 27 cancer foci.Conclusions: Examination with targeted and random biopsies combined with chromoendoscopy is not able to detect small foci of gastric cancer inCDH1 mutation carriers. Therefore PTG is advocated in these patients.	3 4
Prevalence of sarcomere protein gene mutations in preadolescent children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Female Humans Illinois Infant Male Mutation Pedigree Prevalence Sarcomeres || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in infants and children is thought to be commonly associated with metabolic disorders and malformation syndromes. Familial disease caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes, which accounts for most cases in adolescents and adults, is believed to be a very rare cause of HCM. Seventy-nine consecutive patients diagnosed with HCM aged 13 years or younger underwent detailed clinical and genetic evaluation. The protein-coding sequences of 9 sarcomere protein genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, ACTC, and TNNC1), the genes encoding desmin (DES), and the gamma-2 subunit of AMP kinase (PRKAG2) were screened for mutations. A family history of HCM was present in 48 patients (60.8%). Forty-seven mutations (15 novel) were identified in 42 (53.2%) patients (5 patients had 2 mutations). The genes most commonly implicated were MYH7 (48.9%) and MYBPC3 (36.2%); mutations in TNNT2, ACTC, MYL3, and TNNI3 accounted for <5% of cases each. A total of 16.7% patients with sarcomeric mutations were diagnosed before 1 year of age. There were no differences in clinical and echocardiographic features between those children with sarcomere protein gene mutations and those without or between patients with 2 mutations and those with 1 or no mutations. This study shows that familial disease is common among infants and children with HCM and that, in most cases, disease is caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes. The major implication is that all first-degree relatives of any child diagnosed with HCM should be offered screening. Furthermore, the finding that one sixth of patients with sarcomeric disease were diagnosed in infancy suggests that current views on pathogenesis and natural history of familial HCM may have to be revised.	4
In vivo functional analysis of the counterbalance of hyperactive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 catalytic oncoproteins by the tumor suppressor PTEN. || Animals Breast Neoplasms COS Cells Catalysis Cell Line, Tumor Cercopithecus aethiops Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Germ-Line Mutation Humans PTEN Phosphohydrolase Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases Saccharomyces cerevisiae Structure-Activity Relationship Transfection || The signaling pathways involving class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) and the phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate phosphatase PTEN regulate cell proliferation and survival. Thus, mutations in the corresponding genes are associated to a wide variety of human tumors. Heterologous expression of hyperactive forms of mammalian p110alpha and p110beta in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to growth arrest, which is counterbalanced by coexpression of mammalian PTEN. Using this in vivo yeast-based system, we have done an extensive functional analysis of germ-line and somatic human PTEN mutations, as well as a directed mutational analysis of discrete PTEN functional domains. A distinctive penetrance of the PTEN rescue phenotype was observed depending on the levels of PTEN expression in yeast and on the combinations of the inactivating PTEN mutations and the activating p110alpha or p110beta mutations analyzed, which may reflect pathologic differences found in tumors with distinct alterations at the p110 and PTEN genes or proteins. We also define the minimum length of the PTEN protein required for stability and function in vivo. In addition, a random mutagenesis screen on PTEN based on this system allowed both the reisolation of known clinically relevant PTEN mutants and the identification of novel PTEN loss-of-function mutations, which were validated in mammalian cells. Our results show that the PI3K/PTEN yeast-based system is a sensitive tool to test in vivo the pathologic properties and the functionality of mutations in the human p110 proto-oncogenes and the PTEN tumor suppressor and provide a framework for comprehensive functional studies of these tumor-related enzymes.	0
Understanding the function-structure and function-mutation relationships of p53 tumor suppressor protein by high-resolution missense mutation analysis. || Amino Acid Substitution DNA Repair Genes, Reporter Genes, p53 Humans Luciferases Models, Molecular Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation, Missense Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Protein Conformation Protein Structure, Tertiary Recombinant Fusion Proteins Saccharomyces cerevisiae Structure-Activity Relationship Transcriptional Activation Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 by missense mutations is the most frequent genetic alteration in human cancers. The common missense mutations in the TP53 gene disrupt the ability of p53 to bind to DNA and consequently to transactivate downstream genes. However, it is still not fully understood how a large number of the remaining mutations affect p53 structure and function. Here, we used a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis technique and a yeast-based functional assay to construct, express, and evaluate 2,314 p53 mutants representing all possible amino acid substitutions caused by a point mutation throughout the protein (5.9 substitutions per residue), and correlated p53 function with structure- and tumor-derived mutations. This high-resolution mutation analysis allows evaluation of previous predictions and hypotheses through interrelation of function, structure and mutation.	0
Low LDL cholesterol in individuals of African descent resulting from frequent nonsense mutations in PCSK9. || Adult African Continental Ancestry Group Cholesterol, LDL Codon, Nonsense Female Haplotypes Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Serine Endopeptidases || The low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) prevents hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis by removing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from circulation. Mutations in the genes encoding either LDLR or its ligand (APOB) cause severe hypercholesterolemia. Missense mutations in PCSK9, encoding a serine protease in the secretory pathway, also cause hypercholesterolemia. These mutations are probably gain-of-function mutations, as overexpression of PCSK9 in the liver of mice produces hypercholesterolemia by reducing LDLR number. To test whether loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 have the opposite effect, we sequenced the coding region of PCSK9 in 128 subjects (50% African American) with low plasma levels of LDL and found two nonsense mutations (Y142X and C679X). These mutations were common in African Americans (combined frequency, 2%) but rare in European Americans (<0.1%) and were associated with a 40% reduction in plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. These data indicate that common sequence variations have large effects on plasma cholesterol levels in selected populations.	2 4
Mutation screening of the PTEN gene in patients with autism spectrum disorders and macrocephaly. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Sequence Asparagine Aspartic Acid Autistic Disorder Child Child, Preschool Craniofacial Abnormalities DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Female Genetic Testing Humans Introns Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation PTEN Phosphohydrolase Syndrome || Mutations in the PTEN gene are associated with a broad spectrum of disorders, including Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Lhermitte-Duclos disease. In addition, PTEN mutations have been described in a few patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and macrocephaly. In this study, we screened the PTEN gene for mutations and deletions in 88 patients with ASDs and macrocephaly (defined as >or=2 SD above the mean). Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of all exons and flanking regions, as well as the promoter region. Dosage analysis of PTEN was carried out using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). No partial or whole gene deletions were observed. We identified a de novo missense mutation (D326N) in a highly conserved amino acid in a 5-year-old boy with autism, mental retardation, language delay, extreme macrocephaly (+9.6 SD) and polydactyly of both feet. Polydactyly has previously been described in two patients with Lhermitte-Duclos disease and CS and is thus likely to be a rare sign of PTEN mutations. Our findings suggest that PTEN mutations are a relatively infrequent cause of ASDs with macrocephaly. Screening of PTEN mutations is warranted in patients with autism and pronounced macrocephaly, even in the absence of other features of PTEN-related tumor syndromes.	2 1
New insights into POLE and POLD1 germline mutations in familial colorectal cancer and polyposis. || Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Adult Colorectal Neoplasms DNA Polymerase II DNA Polymerase III Female Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins || Germline mutations in DNA polymerase ɛ (POLE) and δ (POLD1) have been recently identified in families with multiple colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer (CRC). All reported cases carried POLE c.1270C>G (p.Leu424Val) or POLD1 c.1433G>A (p.Ser478Asn) mutations. Due to the scarcity of cases reported so far, an accurate clinical phenotype has not been defined. We aimed to assess the prevalence of these recurrent mutations in unexplained familial and early-onset CRC and polyposis, and to add additional information to define the clinical characteristics of mutated cases. A total of 858 familial/early onset CRC and polyposis patients were studied: 581 familial and early-onset CRC cases without mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, 86 cases with MMR deficiency and 191 polyposis cases. Mutation screening was performed by KASPar genotyping assays and/or Sanger sequencing of the involved exons. POLE p.L424V was identified in a 28-year-old polyposis and CRC patient, as a de novo mutation. None of the 858 cases studied carried POLD1 p.S478N. A new mutation, POLD1 c.1421T>C (p.Leu474Pro), was identified in a mismatch repair proficient Amsterdam II family. Its pathogenicity was supported by cosegregation in the family, in silico predictions, and previously published yeast assays. POLE and POLD1 mutations explain a fraction of familial CRC and polyposis. Sequencing the proofreading domains of POLE and POLD1 should be considered in routine genetic diagnostics. Until additional evidence is gathered, POLE and POLD1 genetic testing should not be restricted to polyposis cases, and the presence of de novo mutations, considered.	2 4
Update of the Pompe disease mutation database with 107 sequence variants and a format for severity rating. ||  || Pompe disease was named after the Dutch pathologist Dr JC Pompe who reported about a deceased infant with idiopathic hypertrophy of the heart. The clinical findings were failure to thrive, generalized muscle weakness and cardio-respiratory failure. The key pathologic finding was massive storage of glycogen in heart, skeletal muscle and many other tissues. The disease was classified as glycogen storage disease type II and decades later shown to be a lysosomal disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. The clinical spectrum of Pompe disease appeared much broader than originally recognized. Adults with the same enzyme deficiency, alternatively named acid maltase deficiency, were reported to have slowly progressive skeletal muscle weakness and respiratory problems, but no cardiac involvement. The clinical heterogeneity is largely explained by the kind and severity of mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene (GAA), but secondary factors, as yet unknown, have a substantial impact. The Pompe disease mutation database aims to list all GAA sequence variations and describe their effect. This update with 107 sequence variations (95 being novel) brings the number of published variations to 289, the number of non-pathogenic mutations to 67 and the number of proven pathogenic mutations to 197. Further, this article introduces a tool to rate the various mutations by severity, which will improve understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation and facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis in Pompe disease.	1 4 0
Identification and characterization of the ATP-binding site in human pancreatic glucokinase. || Adenosine Triphosphate Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence Binding Sites Computer Simulation Crystallography, X-Ray Glucokinase Glucose Glucose-6-Phosphate Humans Kinetics Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Pancreas Phosphorylation Substrate Specificity || The central role of human pancreatic glucokinase in insulin secretion and, consequently, in maintenance of blood glucose levels has prompted investigation into identification of ATP-binding site residues and examination of ATP- and glucose-binding interactions. Because glucokinase has been resistant to crystallization, computer generated homology models were developed based on the X-ray crystal structure of the COOH-terminal domain of human brain hexokinase 1 bound to glucose and ADP or glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. Human pancreatic glucokinase mutants were designed based upon these models and on ATPase domain sequence conservation to identify and characterize potential glucose and ATP-binding sites. Specifically, mutants Asp78Ala, Thr82Ala, Lys90Ala, Lys102Ala, Gly227Ala, Thr228Ala, Ser336Leu, Ser411Ala, and Ser411Leu were constructed, expressed, purified, and kinetically characterized under steady-state conditions. Compared to their respective wild type controls, several mutants demonstrated dramatic changes in V(max), cooperativity of glucose binding and S(0.5) for ATP and glucose. Results suggest a role for Asp78, Thr82, Gly227, Thr228, and Ser336 in ATP binding and indicate these residues are essential for glucose phosphorylation by human pancreatic glucokinase.	0
The mutation spectrum of hyperphenylalaninaemia in the Republic of Ireland: the population history of the Irish revisited. || Amino Acid Substitution Crosses, Genetic Exons Gene Frequency Genetics, Population Geography Humans Ireland Mutation Northern Ireland Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Scotland || Phenylketonuric and hyperphenylalaninaemic patients in the population of the Republic of Ireland were screened for mutations at the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus. A composite data set for the island of Ireland was generated by merging the findings of this study with extant data for Northern Ireland. Analysis of this data on the basis of the four historic provinces (Munster, Leinster, Connacht and Ulster) revealed genetic diversity that is informative in terms of demographic forces that shaped the Irish population. R408W, the predominant Irish PAH mutation associated with haplotype 1.8, reached its highest relative frequency in the most westerly province, Connacht. This suggests that the gradient of R408W-1.8 observed across north-western Europe continues into Ireland and peaks in Connacht. Spatial autocorrelation analysis demonstrated that the gradient is consistent with a localised cline of R408W-1.8 likely to have been established by human migration. This and parallel allele frequency clines may represent the genetic traces of the Palaeolithic colonisation of Europe, a pattern not substantially altered in north-western Europe by subsequent Neolithic migrations. An analysis of mutant allele distributions in Ulster, Scotland and the rest of Ireland confirmed that Ulster has been a zone of considerable admixture between the Irish and Scottish populations, indicating a proportion of Scottish admixture in Ulster approaching 46%. Mutations primarily associated with Scandinavia accounted for 6.1% of mutations overall, illustrating the influence of Viking incursions on Irish population history.	3
Genetic study of the PAH locus in the Iranian population: familial gene mutations and minihaplotypes. || Female Gene Frequency Genotype Haplotypes Humans Introns Iran Minisatellite Repeats Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Prevalence || Phenylketonuria (PKU), one of the most common inborn errors of amino acid metabolism, is caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene (PAH). PKU has wide allelic heterogeneity, and over 600 different disease-causing mutations in PAH have been detected to date. Up to now, there have been no reports on the minihaplotype (VNTR/STR) analysis of PAH locus in the Iranian population. The aims of the present study were to determine PAH mutations and minihaplotypes in Iranian families with PAH deficiency and to investigate the correlation between them. A total of 81 Iranian families with PAH deficiency were examined using PCR-sequencing of all 13 PAH exons and their flanking intron regions to identify sequence variations. Fragment analysis of the PAH minihaplotypes was performed by capillary electrophoresis for 59 families. In our study, 33 different mutations were found accounting for 95% of the total mutant alleles. The majority of these mutations (72%) were distributed across exons 7, 11, 2 and their flanking intronic regions. Mutation c.1066-11G > A was the most common with a frequency of 20.37%. The less frequent mutations, p.Arg261Gln (8%), p.Arg243Ter (7.4%), p.Leu48Ser (7.4%), p.Lys363Asnfs*37 (6.79%), c.969 + 5G > A (6.17%), p.Pro281Leu (5.56), c.168 + 5G > C (5.56), and p.Arg261Ter (4.94) together comprised about 52% of all mutant alleles. In this study, a total of seventeen PAH gene minihaplotypes were detected, six of which associated exclusively with particular mutations. Our findings indicate a broad PAH mutation spectrum in the Iranian population, which is consistent with previous studies reporting a wide range of PAH mutations, most likely due to ethnic heterogeneity. High prevalence of c.1066-11G > A mutation linked to minihaplotype 7/250 among both Iranian and Mediterranean populations is indicative of historical and geographical links between them. Also, strong association between particular mutations and minihaplotypes could be useful for prenatal diagnosis (PND) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in affected families.	3
Molecular epidemiology of DFNB1 deafness in France. || Connexin 26 Connexins DNA DNA Mutational Analysis France Gene Frequency Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Mutation Polymorphism, Genetic || Mutations in the GJB2 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited non syndromic deafness in different populations. A high number of sequence variations have been described in the GJB2 gene and the associated pathogenic effects are not always clearly established. The prevalence of a number of mutations is known to be population specific, and therefore population specific testing should be a prerequisite step when molecular diagnosis is offered. Moreover, population studies are needed to determine the contribution of GJB2 variants to deafness. We present our findings from the molecular diagnostic screening of the GJB2 and GJB6 genes over a three year period, together with a population-based study of GJB2 variants. Molecular studies were performed using denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatograghy (DHPLC) and sequencing of the GJB2 gene. Over the last 3 years we have studied 159 families presenting sensorineural hearing loss, including 84 with non syndromic, stable, bilateral deafness. Thirty families were genotyped with causative mutations. In parallel, we have performed a molecular epidemiology study on more than 3000 dried blood spots and established the frequency of the GJB2 variants in our population. Finally, we have compared the prevalence of the variants in the hearing impaired population with the general population. Although a high heterogeneity of sequence variation was observed in patients and controls, the 35delG mutation remains the most common pathogenic mutation in our population. Genetic counseling is dependent on the knowledge of the pathogenicity of the mutations and remains difficult in a number of cases. By comparing the sequence variations observed in hearing impaired patients with those sequence variants observed in general population, from the same ethnic background, we show that the M34T, V37I and R127H variants can not be responsible for profound or severe deafness.	1
An effective screening strategy for deafness in combination with a next-generation sequencing platform: a consecutive analysis. || DNA Deafness High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Japan || The diagnosis of the genetic etiology of deafness contributes to the clinical management of patients. We performed the following four genetic tests in three stages for 52 consecutive deafness subjects in one facility. We used the Invader assay for 46 mutations in 13 genes and Sanger sequencing for the GJB2 gene or SLC26A4 gene in the first-stage test, the TaqMan genotyping assay in the second-stage test and targeted exon sequencing using massively parallel DNA sequencing in the third-stage test. Overall, we identified the genetic cause in 40% (21/52) of patients. The diagnostic rates of autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and sporadic cases were 50%, 60% and 34%, respectively. When the sporadic cases with congenital and severe hearing loss were selected, the diagnostic rate rose to 48%. The combination approach using these genetic tests appears to be useful as a diagnostic tool for deafness patients. We recommended that genetic testing for the screening of common mutations in deafness genes using the Invader assay or TaqMan genotyping assay be performed as the initial evaluation. For the remaining undiagnosed cases, targeted exon sequencing using massively parallel DNA sequencing is clinically and economically beneficial.	4
Novel GAA mutations in patients with Pompe disease. || Adolescent Adult African Americans Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Brazil Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child Child, Preschool Codon, Nonsense Early Diagnosis European Continental Ancestry Group Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Glycogen Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant Male Middle Aged Muscle Hypotonia Mutation, Missense Sequence Analysis, DNA Sequence Deletion Young Adult alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder linked to GAA gene that leads to a multi-system intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen. Mutation identification in the GAA gene can be very important for early diagnosis, correlation between genotype-phenotype and therapeutic intervention. For this purpose, peripheral blood from 57 individuals susceptible to Pompe disease was collected and all exons of GAA gene were amplified; the sequences and the mutations were analyzed in silico to predict possible impact on the structure and function of the human protein. In this study, 46 individuals presented 33 alterations in the GAA gene sequence, among which five (c.547-67C>G, c.547-39T>G, p.R437H, p.L641V and p.L705P) have not been previously described in the literature. The alterations in the coding region included 15 missense mutations, three nonsense mutations and one deletion. One insertion and other 13 single base changes were found in the non-coding region. The mutation p.G611D was found in homozygosis in a one-year-old child, who presented low levels of GAA activity, hypotonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two patients presented the new mutation p.L705P in association with c.-32-13T>G. They had low levels of GAA activity and developed late onset Pompe disease. In our study, we observed alterations in the GAA gene originating from Asians, African-Americans and Caucasians, highlighting the high heterogeneity of the Brazilian population. Considering that Pompe disease studies are not very common in Brazil, this study will help to better understand the potential pathogenic role of each change in the GAA gene. Furthermore, a precise and early molecular analysis improves genetic counseling besides allowing for a more efficient treatment in potential candidates.	1 4
Early detection of organ involvement in Fabry disease by biomarker assessment in conjunction with LGE cardiac MRI: results from the SOPHIA study. ||  || Initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) early in the Fabry disease course may facilitate better outcomes than in patients with advanced disease. Early diagnosis is often hindered by the heterogeneous nature of signs and symptoms, and by the presentation of atypical phenotypes. The Sophisticated Assessment of Disease Burden in Patients with Fabry Disease study (SOPHIA; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01210196) evaluated clinical and diagnostic assessments for early detection of Fabry-related organ pathology in ERT-naïve patients with mild FD symptoms. Assessments included cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE-CMR), echocardiography, 24-h Holter electrocardiography, and biomarkers of FD and fibrosis. 35 patients with mean (SD) baseline age of 45.0 (10.2) years were included and assessed at baseline, 12 months, and (optionally) at 24 months. At baseline, LGE-CMR and elevated procollagen III N-terminal propeptide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and globotriaosylsphingosine were the most prevalent indicators of early Fabry-related pathology. LGE was already present in 58.8% of patients with normal left ventricular mass index. 15.2% of patients showed grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. QRS duration increased from baseline to last observation, particularly in patients with severe baseline fibrosis. Fibrosis progressed from baseline to last observation, especially in patients with baseline LGE ≥ 2.50 mL (3.65 [1.14] mL vs 6.74 [1.10] mL). Statistically significant correlations were found between LGE volume and high-sensitivity troponin T, and between LGE volume and fragments of urinary collagen alpha-1 (I), (III), and (VII), and collagen alpha-3 (V). Fibrosis may become apparent before left ventricular hypertrophy occurs. LGE-CMR imaging is superior to conventional echocardiography for detecting early cardiomyopathy in FD and, in conjunction with biomarker tests, may help detect early organ involvement in mild FD.	4
Germline E-cadherin mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: assessment of 42 new families and review of genetic screening criteria. || Adolescent Adult Aged Cadherins Child DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Testing Genetic Variation Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree Stomach Neoplasms || Mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene are a well documented cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Development of evidence based guidelines for CDH1 screening for HDGC have been complicated by its rarity, variable penetrance, and lack of founder mutations. Forty three new gastric cancer (GC) families were ascertained from multiple sources. In 42 of these families at least one gastric cancer was pathologically confirmed to be a diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); the other family had intestinal type gastric cancers. Screening of the entire coding region of the CDH1 gene and all intron/exon boundaries was performed by bi-directional sequencing. Novel mutations were found in 13 of the 42 DGC families (31% overall). Twelve of these mutations occur among the 25 families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and with pathologic confirmation of diffuse gastric cancer phenotype in at least one individual under the age of 50 years. The mutations found include small insertions and deletions, splice site mutations, and three non-conservative amino acid substitutions (A298T, W409R, and R732Q). All three missense mutations conferred loss of E-cadherin function in in vitro assays. Multiple cases of breast cancers including pathologically confirmed lobular breast cancers were observed both in mutation positive and negative families. Germline truncating CDH1 mutations are found in 48% of families with multiple cases of gastric cancer and at least one documented case of DGC in an individual under 50 years of age. We recommend that these criteria be used for selecting families for CDH1 mutational analysis.	2 4 0 3
Molecular characterization of loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 and identification of a compound heterozygote. || Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Sequence Cells, Cultured Child, Preschool Cholesterol, LDL Female Heterozygote Humans Immunoprecipitation Male Middle Aged Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense Pedigree Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Protein Conformation Protein Folding Protein Transport Recombinant Proteins Serine Endopeptidases || Elevated levels of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) play a central role in the development of atherosclerosis. Mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) that are associated with lower plasma levels of LDL-C confer protection from coronary heart disease. Here, we show that four severe loss-of-function mutations prevent the secretion of PCSK9 by disrupting synthesis or trafficking of the protein. In contrast to recombinant wild-type PCSK9, which was secreted from cells into the medium within 2 hours, the severe loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 largely abolished PCSK9 secretion. This finding predicted that circulating levels of PCSK9 would be lower in individuals with the loss-of-function mutations. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of plasma for PCSK9 provided direct evidence that the serine protease is present in the circulation and identified the first known individual who has no immunodetectable circulating PCSK9. This healthy, fertile college graduate, who was a compound heterozygote for two inactivating mutations in PCSK9, had a strikingly low plasma level of LDL-C (14 mg/dL). The very low plasma level of LDL-C and apparent good health of this individual demonstrate that PCSK9 plays a major role in determining plasma levels of LDL-C and provides an attractive target for LDL-lowering therapy.	2 0
A retrospective chart review of the features of PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome in children. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Cohort Studies Endoscopy Female Gray Matter Hamartoma Syndrome, Multiple Humans Infant Male Phenotype Retrospective Studies Young Adult || It is recognised that 5% - 10 % of children with macrocephaly and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (ID) have a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the PTEN tumour suppressor gene that is associated with PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome. However, the clinical features and course in children with a pathogenicPTEN mutation are unclear and have not been well documented. We undertook a retrospective chart review of children (< 18 years) with pathogenic PTEN mutations to ascertain clinical findings, clinical course and possible outcomes. Clinical and molecular data were collected and analysed for 47 patients with PTEN mutation from 38 eligible families. Macrocephaly (average head circumference of + 5.7 SD) with developmental delay, ID and/or ASD were the most common presenting signs/symptoms (66 %). Clinical features included dermatological findings (66 %), gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (34 %), ASD diagnosis (50 %), abnormal brain imaging (53 % of those examined) and abnormal thyroid imaging (26 %). This is the largest survey of clinical features in children with PTEN pathogenic mutations to date. It confirms earlier reports of increased rates of neurodevelopmental disorders. Dermatological, GI and thyroid abnormalities are age dependent and may not be present at the time of diagnosis, requiring regular monitoring and medical surveillance. Early paediatric diagnosis is important for institution of medical and developmental surveillance as well as for testing other at- risk family members.	3
Missense mutations in the beta-myosin heavy-chain gene cause central core disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. || Adolescent Adult Amino Acid Sequence Arginine Base Sequence Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Child, Preschool Codon DNA Exons Female Glutamine Humans Introns Leucine Leukocytes Male Microscopy, Electron Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Muscles Myosins Oligodeoxyribonucleotides Pedigree Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Genetic Valine || Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of sudden death in apparently healthy young individuals. In less than half of kindreds with HCM, the disease is linked to the beta-myosin heavy-chain gene locus (MYH7). We have recently described two missense MYH7 gene mutations [Arg-403 to Gln (R403Q) and Leu-908 to Val (L908V)] and found that the mutant message is present in skeletal muscle soleus) and that the mutant beta-myosin obtained from soleus muscle has abnormal in vitro motility activity. Having identified a second kindred with the R403Q mutation, and 3 other kindreds with two additional mutations (G741R and G256E), we performed histochemical analysis of soleus muscle biopsies from 25 HCM patients with one of these four mutations. Light microscopic examination of the NADH-stained biopsies revealed the presence of central core disease (CCD) of skeletal muscle, a rare autosomal dominant nonprogressive myopathy characterized by a predominance of type I "slow" fibers and an absence of mitochondria in the center of many type I fibers. CCD was present in 10 of 13 patients with the L908V mutation, 5 of 8 patients with the R403Q mutation, 1 of 3 patients with the G741R mutation, and 1 patient with the G256E mutation. Mild-to-moderate myopathic changes with muscle fiber hypertrophy were present in 16 patients. Notably, CCD was present in 2 adults and 3 children with the L908V mutation who did not have cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, soleus muscle samples from 5 patients from 4 kindreds in which HCM was not linked to the MYH7 locus showed no myopathy or CCD. Soleus muscle biopsies from 5 control subjects also showed normal histology. This work demonstrates that (i) MYH7-associated HCM is often a disease of striated muscle but with predominant cardiac involvement and (ii) a subset of HCM patients with MYH7 gene missense mutations have CCD.	2 4
Melanocortin-4 receptor gene mutations in obese Slovak children. ||  || The most common etiology of non-syndromic monogenic obesity are mutations in gene for the Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC485) with variable prevalence in different countries (1.2-6.3 % of obese children). The aim of our study was 1) to search for MC4R mutations in obese children in Slovakia and compare their prevalence with other European countries, and 2) to describe the phenotype of the mutation carriers. DNA analysis by direct Sanger sequencing of the coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of the MC4R gene was performed in 268 unrelated Slovak children and adolescents with body mass index above the 97(th) percentile for age and sex and obesity onset up to 11 years (mean 4.3+/-2.8 years). Two different previously described heterozygous loss of function MC4R variants (i.e. p.Ser19Alafs*34, p.Ser127Leu) were identified in two obese probands, and one obese (p.Ser19Alafs*34), and one lean (p.Ser127Leu) adult family relatives. No loss of function variants were found in lean controls. The prevalence of loss-of-function MC4R variants in obese Slovak children was 0.7 %, what is one of the lowest frequencies in Europe.	4
Elevated plasma succinate in PTEN, SDHB, and SDHD mutation-positive individuals. ||  || Cowden syndrome results from germline mutations in the gene for phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and from variants in succinate dehydrogenase B and D subunits. We hypothesized that succinate accumulation may be common among individuals with SDH variants/mutations and those with PTEN mutations. Urine and blood were collected from individuals meeting full or partial Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria or those with paraganglioma (PGL) or a known susceptibility paraganglioma-associated gene mutation, and succinate was measured. PTEN, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes were sequenced from genomic DNA. Elevated plasma succinate was observed in 13/21 (62%) individuals with germline PTEN, SDHB, or SDHD mutations as compared with 5/32 (16%) controls (P < 0.001), in 10/15 (67%) individuals with pathogenic PTEN mutations but in <20% of mutation-negative individuals meeting identical criteria, and in individuals with mutations in SDHB (1/1, 100%) and SDHD (2/5, 40%). Our data suggest that mutations in PTEN, SDHB, and SDHD reduce catalytic activity of succinate dehydrogenase, resulting in succinate accumulation, and identify a common biochemical alteration in these two patient populations (PTEN and SDHx mutation positive individuals). Plasma organic acid analysis may provide an effective and inexpensive screening method to determine when more expensive gene sequencing of PTEN and SDH genes is warranted.	3 4
Second malignant neoplasms in patients with Cowden syndrome with underlying germline PTEN mutations. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Hamartoma Syndrome, Multiple Humans Male Middle Aged Neoplasms Neoplasms, Second Primary PTEN Phosphohydrolase Prospective Studies Risk Factors Young Adult || Patients with Cowden syndrome (CS) with underlying germline PTEN mutations are at increased risk of breast, thyroid, endometrial, and renal cancers. To our knowledge, risk of subsequent cancers in these patients has not been previously explored or quantified. We conducted a 7-year multicenter prospective study (2005 to 2012) of patients with CS or CS-like disease, all of whom underwent comprehensive PTEN mutational analysis. Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) were ascertained by medical records and confirmed by pathology reports. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all SMNs combined and for breast, thyroid, endometrial, and renal cancers were calculated. Of the 2,912 adult patients included in our analysis, 2,024 had an invasive cancer history. Germline pathogenic PTEN mutations (PTEN mutation positive) were identified in 114 patients (5.6%). Of these 114 patients, 46 (40%) had an SMN. Median age of SMN diagnosis was 50 years (range, 21 to 71 years). Median interval between primary cancer and SMN was 5 years (range, <1 to 35 years). Of the 51 PTEN mutation-positive patients who presented with primary breast cancer, 11 (22%) had a subsequent new primary breast cancer and 10-year second breast cancer cumulative risk of 29% (95% CI, 15.3 to 43.7). Risk of SMNs compared with that of the general population was significantly elevated for all cancers (SIR, 7.74; 95% CI, 5.84 to 10.07), specifically for breast (SIR, 8.92; 95% CI, 5.85 to 13.07), thyroid (SIR, 5.83; 95% CI, 3.01 to 10.18), and endometrial SMNs (SIR, 14.08.07; 95% CI, 7.10 to 27.21). Patients with CS with germline PTEN mutations are at higher risk for SMNs compared with the general population. Prophylactic mastectomy should be considered on an individual basis given the significant risk of subsequent breast cancer.	3
Phenylketonuria in U.S. blacks: molecular analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. || African Continental Ancestry Group Alleles Amino Acid Sequence DNA Gene Frequency Haplotypes Homozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias United States || We investigated the frequency, origin, and molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) in U.S. blacks. On the basis of 10 years of Maryland newborn-screening data, we found the frequency to be 1/50,000, or one-third that in whites. We performed haplotype analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene of 36 U.S. blacks, 16 from individuals with classical PKU and 20 from controls. In blacks, 20% of wild-type PAH alleles have a common Caucasian haplotype (i.e., haplotype 1), whereas 80% had a variety of haplotypes, all rare in Caucasians and Asians. One of these, haplotype 15, accounted for a large fraction (30%). Among black mutant PAH alleles, 20% have a haplotype (i.e., either haplotype 1 or haplotype 4) common in Caucasians; 40% have a haplotype rare in Caucasians and Asians, and 40% have one of two previously undescribed haplotypes. Both can be derived from known haplotypes by a single event. One of these haplotypes is characterized by a new MspI restriction site, located in intron 8, which was present in five of 16 black mutant alleles but was not present in 60 U.S. black control, 20 U.S. Caucasian control, or 20 Caucasian mutant PAH alleles. Sequence analysis of DNA from a single individual, homozygous for the new MspI associated haplotype, shows homozygosity for a C----T transition at nucleotide 896 in exon 7 of the PAH cDNA, resulting in the conversion of leucine 255 to serine (L255S).	3 1
Identification of genetic susceptibility to childhood cancer through analysis of genes in parallel. || Adolescent Adult Algorithms Child DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Repair Gene Dosage Genes, Dominant Genes, Recessive Genes, Tumor Suppressor Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Immunoprecipitation Models, Genetic Mutation Neoplasms Oncogenes Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction Rhabdoid Tumor || Clinical cancer genetic susceptibility analysis typically proceeds sequentially, beginning with the most likely causative gene. The process is time consuming and the yield is low, particularly for families with unusual patterns of cancer. We determined the results of in parallel mutation analysis of a large cancer-associated gene panel. We performed deletion analysis and sequenced the coding regions of 45 genes (8 oncogenes and 37 tumor suppressor or DNA repair genes) in 48 childhood cancer patients who also (i) were diagnosed with a second malignancy under age 30, (ii) have a sibling diagnosed with cancer under age 30, and/or (iii) have a major congenital anomaly or developmental delay. Deleterious mutations were identified in 6 of 48 (13%) families, 4 of which met the sibling criteria. Mutations were identified in genes previously implicated in both dominant and recessive childhood syndromes, including SMARCB1, PMS2, and TP53. No pathogenic deletions were identified. This approach has provided efficient identification of childhood cancer susceptibility mutations and will have greater utility as additional cancer susceptibility genes are identified. Integrating parallel analysis of large gene panels into clinical testing will speed results and increase diagnostic yield. The failure to detect mutations in 87% of families highlights that a number of childhood cancer susceptibility genes remain to be discovered.	3

Characterization of structural p53 mutants which show selective defects in apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest. || Apoptosis Cell Cycle Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 Cyclins Humans Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos Temperature Transcriptional Activation Tumor Cells, Cultured Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 bcl-2-Associated X Protein || Suppression of tumor cell growth by p53 results from the activation of both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, functions which have been shown to be separable activities of p53. We have characterized a series of p53 mutants with amino acid substitutions at residue 175 and show that these mutants fall into one of three classes: class I, which is essentially wild type for apoptotic and cell cycle arrest functions; class II, which retains cell cycle arrest activity but is impaired in the induction of apoptosis; and class III, which is defective in both activities. Several residue 175 mutants which retain cell cycle arrest function have been detected in cancers, and we show that these have lost apoptotic function. Furthermore, several class II mutants have been found to be temperature sensitive for apoptotic activity while showing constitutive cell cycle arrest function. Taken together, these mutants comprise an excellent system with which to investigate the biochemical nature of p53-mediated apoptosis, the function of principal importance in tumor suppression. All of the mutants that showed loss of apoptotic function also showed defects in the activation of promoters from the potential apoptotic targets Bax and the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 gene (IGF-BP3), and a correlation between full apoptotic activity and activation of both of these promoters was also seen with the temperature-sensitive mutants. However, a role for additional apoptotic activities of p53 was suggested by the observation that some mutants retained significant apoptotic function despite being impaired in the activation of Bax- and IGF-BP3-derived promoters. In contrast to the case of transcriptional activation, a perfect correlation between transcriptional repression of the c-fos promoter and the ability to induce apoptosis was seen, although the observation that Bax expression induced a similar repression of transcription from this promoter suggests that this may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of apoptotic death.	0
Acute cerebrovascular disease in the young: the Stroke in Young Fabry Patients study. || Acute Disease Adolescent Adult Age Factors Cerebrovascular Disorders Cohort Studies Europe Fabry Disease Female Humans Male Middle Aged Prospective Studies Risk Factors Stroke Young Adult || Strokes have especially devastating implications if they occur early in life; however, only limited information exists on the characteristics of acute cerebrovascular disease in young adults. Although risk factors and manifestation of atherosclerosis are commonly associated with stroke in the elderly, recent data suggests different causes for stroke in the young. We initiated the prospective, multinational European study Stroke in Young Fabry Patients (sifap) to characterize a cohort of young stroke patients. Overall, 5023 patients aged 18 to 55 years with the diagnosis of ischemic stroke (3396), hemorrhagic stroke (271), transient ischemic attack (1071) were enrolled in 15 European countries and 47 centers between April 2007 and January 2010 undergoing a detailed, standardized, clinical, laboratory, and radiological protocol. Median age in the overall cohort was 46 years. Definite Fabry disease was diagnosed in 0.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.4%-0.8%; n=27) of all patients; and probable Fabry disease in additional 18 patients. Males dominated the study population (2962/59%) whereas females outnumbered men (65.3%) among the youngest patients (18-24 years). About 80.5% of the patients had a first stroke. Silent infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging were seen in 20% of patients with a first-ever stroke, and in 11.4% of patients with transient ischemic attack and no history of a previous cerebrovascular event. The most common causes of ischemic stroke were large artery atherosclerosis (18.6%) and dissection (9.9%). Definite Fabry disease occurs in 0.5% and probable Fabry disease in further 0.4% of young stroke patients. Silent infarcts, white matter intensities, and classical risk factors were highly prevalent, emphasizing the need for new early preventive strategies.

Correlation between quantitative whole-body muscle magnetic resonance imaging and clinical muscle weakness in Pompe disease. || Adolescent Adult Aged Case-Control Studies Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Magnetic Resonance Imaging Male Middle Aged Muscle Strength Muscle Weakness Muscle, Skeletal Physical Examination Pilot Projects Sensitivity and Specificity Severity of Illness Index Whole Body Imaging || Previous examination of whole-body muscle involvement in Pompe disease has been limited to physical examination and/or qualitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study we assess the feasibility of quantitative proton-density fat-fraction (PDFF) whole-body MRI in late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and compare the results with manual muscle testing. Seven LOPD patients and 11 disease-free controls underwent whole-body PDFF MRI. Quantitative MR muscle group assessments were compared with physical testing of muscle groups. The 95% upper limits of confidence intervals for muscle groups were 4.9-12.6% in controls and 6.8-76.4% in LOPD patients. LOPD patients showed severe and consistent tongue and axial muscle group involvement, with less marked involvement of peripheral musculature. MRI was more sensitive than physical examination for detection of abnormality in multiple muscle groups. This integrated, quantitative approach to muscle assessment provides more detailed data than physical examination and may have clinical utility for monitoring disease progression and treatment response.	1
Genomic structure and identification of novel mutations in usherin, the gene responsible for Usher syndrome type IIa. || Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence Child Codon, Terminator DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female Frameshift Mutation Genotype Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heteroduplex Analysis Humans Introns Linkage Disequilibrium Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Mutation, Missense RNA Splicing Retinitis Pigmentosa Sequence Alignment Syndrome || Usher syndrome type IIa (USHIIa) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss and progressive retinitis pigmentosa. This disorder maps to human chromosome 1q41. Recently, mutations in USHIIa patients were identified in a novel gene isolated from this chromosomal region. The USH2A gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 171.5 kD and possesses laminin epidermal growth factor as well as fibronectin type III domains. These domains are observed in other protein components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes; they may also be observed in cell-adhesion molecules. The intron/exon organization of the gene whose protein we name "Usherin" was determined by direct sequencing of PCR products and cloned genomic DNA with cDNA-specific primers. The gene is encoded by 21 exons and spans a minimum of 105 kb. A mutation search of 57 independent USHIIa probands was performed with a combination of direct sequencing and heteroduplex analysis of PCR-amplified exons. Fifteen new mutations were found. Of 114 independent USH2A alleles, 58 harbored probable pathologic mutations. Ten cases of USHIIa were true homozygotes and 10 were compound heterozygotes; 18 heterozygotes with only one identifiable mutation were observed. Sixty-five percent (38/58) of cases had at least one mutation, and 51% (58/114) of the total number of possible mutations were identified. The allele 2299delG (previously reported as 2314delG) was the most frequent mutant allele observed (16%; 31/192). Three new missense mutations (C319Y, N346H, and C419F) were discovered; all were restricted to the previously unreported laminin domain VI region of Usherin. The possible significance of this domain, known to be necessary for laminin network assembly, is discussed in the context of domain VI mutations from other proteins.	2 4 3
[Ten novel mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene identified in Chinese patients with phenylketonuria]. || Adult Child Exons Female Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Infant Male Mutation Mutation, Missense Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Sequence Analysis, DNA || To study the molecular basis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutation in Chinese patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Using PCR/SSCP and DNA sequencing, we studied the mutations in exons 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 of PAH gene. Totally 120 unrelated children with PKU and their parents from the northern region of China were included in the analysis. Ten novel mutations were first time identified in Chinese PKU population as I65T, S70del, G239D, R241fsdelG, L255S, P281L, G346R, L367fsinsC, R400S and Ivsllnt2t-->c. The mutations G239D, R241fsdelG, R400S and Ivsllnt2t-->c have not been yet described in International PAH. In the present study we firstly identified the deletion, insertion and frameshift mutations of PAH gene in China PKU population. So far the mutant type of PAH gene in Chinese included: missense, nonsense, splice, silence, deletion, insertion and frameshift. Novel mutations mainly existed in exon 7: four in exon 7, two in exon 3, two in exon 11, one in exon 10 and one in intron 11. Each proportion of the ten novel mutations was very low (0.42%-1.3%). This study demonstrated the high heterogeneity of the PAH gene and the variety of the mutant type of Chinese PKU population and confirmed the exon 7 was the hot spot of PAH gene mutation.	3
Mutation spectrum in Taiwanese patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and a founder effect for the R241C mutation. ||  || The spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene mutations was determined in 25 families of hyperphenylalaninemia identified by a neonatal screening program in Taiwan. The coding sequence and exon-flanking intron sequences of PAH gene were amplified and sequenced. Mutations were identified in forty-five of the 50 chromosomes. R241C was the most common mutation (36% of the chromosomes), followed by R408Q (14% of the chromosomes). The remaining mutations were rare and seven mutations have not been reported before: p.F233L (c.697T>C), p.R252Q (c.756G>A), p.E286K (c.856G>A), p.G312V (c.935G>T), p.P314T (c.940C>A), p.I95del (c.284_286delTCA), and p.T81fsX6 (c.241_256del). Both p.R241C and p.R408Q are classified as mild phenylketonuria (PKU) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) mutation, which may explain the fact that classical PKU is very rare in Taiwan (n=4, or one in 413,035). This strong founder effect for the p.R241C mutation has been described neither in the Caucasian populations, nor in other reports from Chinese. Since most of the populations in Taiwan are derived from Southeastern China, the spectrum of PAH gene mutations in Southeastern China should be different from other Chinese populations. This report not only disclose a specific spectrum of PAH gene mutation in Taiwan, but may also give clues to the movement of populations in Mainland China.	3 1
Biological Activities of RUNX1 Mutants Predict Secondary Acute Leukemia Transformation from Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes. || Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit Core Binding Factor beta Subunit DNA Mutational Analysis DNA-Binding Proteins Disease Progression Female Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic HEK293 Cells Humans Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic Male Mutation Myelodysplastic Syndromes Neoplasm Proteins Prognosis Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor || Transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for normal hematopoiesis. High mutation frequencies of RUNX1 gene in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been described, whereas the biologic significances of the mutations were not investigated. Here, we aimed to correlate the biologic activities of the RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes of patients. We examined the mutational status of RUNX1 in 143 MDS and 84 CMML patients. Then, we studied the DNA and CBFβ binding abilities of all the RUNX1 mutants identified by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay, and also determined their activities on target C-FMS gene induction by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. Using luciferase reporter assay, the relative biologic activities of each RUNX1 mutant could be quantified and correlated with the patient outcomes by statistical analyses. We observed that most RUNX1 mutants had reduced abilities in DNA binding, CBFβ heterodimerization, and C-FMS gene induction. The relative biologic activities of RUNX1 mutants were grouped into high- and low-activity mutations. Correlation of the activities of RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes revealed that patients harboring lower activities of RUNX1 mutants had a higher risk and shorter time to secondary acute myeloid leukemia transformation in MDS and CMML. In multivariate analysis, low RUNX1 activity remained an independent predictor for secondary acute myeloid leukemia-free survival in MDS patients. The biologic activity rather than the mutational status of RUNX1 might be an indicator in predicting outcome of patients with MDS and CMML.	0
Simultaneous assessment of the effects of exonic mutations on RNA splicing and protein functions. || DNA Mutational Analysis DNA, Complementary Exons Genotype Humans Introns Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase RNA Splicing || To simultaneously assess the effects of exonic mutations on RNA splicing and protein functions, we report here an intron-inclusive cDNA (Intinc) expression system. As a test model, twenty-four mutations in exon 9 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene were examined in an Intinc expression plasmid composed of the PAH cDNA with the exon 9 flanked by its authentic introns. When the PAH enzyme activities from the Intinc plasmid-transfected cells were compared to those of a standard cDNA expression system, five mutations resulted in significant relative differences in PAH activities attributed to altered exon 9-inclusive mRNA levels. Two of the mutations affected exon recognition probably through splice site modifications and the remaining three affected experimentally verified exon splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs. The Intinc expression system allows not only a better link between mutation genotype to disease phenotype but also contributes to further understanding of molecular mechanisms of deleterious effects of mutations.	0
Fabry disease: identification of 50 novel alpha-galactosidase A mutations causing the classic phenotype and three-dimensional structural analysis of 29 missense mutations. || Base Sequence DNA Mutational Analysis DNA Primers Fabry Disease Family Female Humans Introns Male Microsatellite Repeats Molecular Sequence Data Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation Mutation, Missense Nucleic Acid Conformation Polymerase Chain Reaction Prenatal Diagnosis Recombination, Genetic Reference Values alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease, an X-linked recessive inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal exoglycohydrolase, alpha-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22; alpha-Gal A). The molecular lesions in the alpha-Gal A gene causing the classic phenotype of Fabry disease in 66 unrelated families were determined. In 49 families, 50 new mutations were identified, including: 29 missense mutations (N34K, T41I, D93V, R112S, L166G, G171D, M187T, S201Y, S201F, D234E, W236R, D264Y, M267R, V269M, G271S, G271V, S276G, Q283P, A285P, A285D, M290I, P293T, Q312H, Q321R, G328V, E338K, A348P, E358A, Q386P); nine nonsense mutations (C56X, E79X, K127X, Y151X, Y173X, L177X, W262X, Q306X, E338X); five splicing defects (IVS4-1G>A, IVS5-2A>G, IVS5+3A>G, IVS5+4A>G, IVS6-1G>C); four small deletions (18delA, 457delGAC, 567delG, 1096delACCAT); one small insertion (996insC); one 3.1 kilobase Alu-Alu deletion (which included exon 2); and one complex mutation (K374R, 1124delGAG). In 18 families, 17 previously reported mutations were identified, with R112C occurring in two families. In two classically affected families, affected males were identified with two mutations: one with two novel mutations, D264Y and V269M and the other with one novel (Q312H) and one previously reported (A143T) mutation. Transient expression of the individual mutations revealed that D264Y and Q312H were localised in the endoplasmic reticulum and had no detectable or markedly reduced activity, whereas V269M and A143T were localised in lysosomes and had approximately 10 per cent and approximately 35 per cent of expressed wild-type activity, respectively. Structural analyses based on the enzyme's three-dimensional structure predicted the effect of the 29 novel missense mutations on the mutant glycoprotein's structure. Of note, three novel mutations (approximately 10 per cent) were predicted not to significantly alter the glycoprotein's structure; however, they were disease causing. These studies further define the molecular heterogeneity of the alpha-Gal A mutations in classical Fabry disease, permit precise heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis, and provide insights into the structural alterations of the mutant enzymes that cause the classic phenotype.	0
Mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in patients with phenylketonuria in Shanxi, China. ||  || The variation in mutations in exons 3, 6, 7, 11 and 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene was investigated in 59 children with phenylketonuria (PKU) and 100 normal children. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected by sequence analysis. The mutational frequencies of cDNA 696, cDNA 735 and cDNA 1155 in patients were 96.2%, 76.1% and 7.6%, respectively, whereas in healthy children the corresponding frequencies were 97.0%, 77.3% and 8.3%. In addition, 81 mutations accounted for 61.0% of the mutant alleles. R111X, H64 > TfsX9 and S70 del accounted for 5.1%, 0.8% and 0.8% mutation of alleles in exon 3, whereas EX6-96A > G accounted for 10.2% mutation of alleles in exon 6. R243Q had the highest incidence in exon 7 (12.7%), followed by Ivs7 + 2 T > A (5.1%) and T278I (2.5%). G247V, R252Q, L255S, R261Q and E280K accounted for 0.8% while Y356X and V399V accounted for 5.9% and 5.1%, respectively, in exon 11. R413P and A434D accounted for 5.9% and 2.5%, respectively, in exon 12. Seventy-two variant alleles accounted for the 16 mutations observed here. The mutation characteristics and distributions demonstrated that EX6-96A > G and R243Q were the hot regions for mutations in the PAH gene in Shanxi patients with PKU.	3
Biochemical characterization of MODY2 glucokinase variants V62M and G72R reveals reduced enzymatic activities relative to wild type. || Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Enzyme Stability Genetic Variation Glucokinase Glucose Humans Kinetics Mutation, Missense || The glucokinase V62M and G72R mutations are naturally occurring and known to associate with hyperglycemia in humans. Structurally, V62 and G72 residues are located in close proximity to the allosteric site where hypoglycemia-linked activating mutations are clustered. To address the mechanism by which these variants alter the physiological phenotype, we characterized the biochemical and biophysical properties of the enzymes. Recombinant proteins were purified without affinity tags, and their steady-state kinetics and glucose binding affinities were determined. Both enzymes showed reduced rates of turnover (k(cat)) and reduced glucose affinity (i.e., increased K(0.5) and K(D) values). Their thermal stability did not largely differ from that of wild-type glucokinase. However, V62M and G72R lost the stabilizing protein interactions with glucokinase regulatory protein, which may contribute to lower activity in vivo. Both mutants were subject to activation by small molecule activators. In conclusion, the decreased enzyme activities of V62M and G72R observed in this study are consistent with the hyperglycemic phenotype.	0
Genetic screening of Fabry patients with EcoTILLING and HRM technology. ||  || Anderson-Fabry disease (FD) is caused by a deficit of the α-galactosidase A enzyme which leads to the accumulation of complex sphingolipids, especially globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), in all the cells of the body, causing the onset of a multi-systemic disease with poor prognosis in adulthood. In this article, we describe two alternative methods for screening the GLA gene which codes for the α-galactosidase A enzyme in subjects with probable FD in order to test analysis strategies which include or rely on initial pre-screening. We analyzed 740 samples using EcoTILLING, comparing two mismatch-specificendonucleases, CEL I and ENDO-1, while conducting a parallel screening of the same samples using HRM (High Resolution Melting). Afterwards, all samples were subjected to direct sequencing. Overall, we identified 12 different genetic variations: -10C>T, -12G>A, -30G>A, IVS2-76_80del5, D165H, C172Y, IVS4+16A>G, IVS4 +68 A>G, c.718_719delAA, D313Y, IVS6-22C>T, G395A. This was consistent with the high genetic heterogeneity found in FD patients and carriers. All of the mutations were detected by HRM, whereas 17% of the mutations were not found by EcoTILLING. The results obtained by EcoTILLING comparing the CEL I and ENDO-1 endonucleases were perfectly overlapping. On the basis of its simplicity, flexibility, repeatability, and sensitivity, we believe thatHRM analysis of the GLA gene is a reliable presequencing screening tool. This method can be applied to any genomic feature to identify known and unknown genetic alterations, and it is ideal for conducting screening and population studies.	3 4
New mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation in late-onset Pompe patients. || 2737dupG Cognitive impairment Late-onset Pompe disease c.1209C>A c.547-39T>G c.858+5ins7 || Pompe disease is a glycogen storage disease caused by acid alfa-glucosidase deficiency. Here, we report clinical properties, genetic features of our late-onset Pompe patients. Seven patients were followed during the last 10 years in our institute. The clinical and laboratory findings were reviewed. Neuropsychological evaluation was performed in four patients. Myotonic discharges of paraspinal muscles and denervation potentials were seen in all patients at the diagnosis and were disappeared during follow-up in two. Only one patient, whose MRI showed cerebral atrophy, had attention and executive dysfunction. Compound heterozygous patients with IVS 1-13T>G have a milder disease. One patient who has homozygous IVS 1-13T>G mutation had more severe disease. Two of our patients who had very severe and fatal disease course carry double mutations on both alleles (c.547-39T>G and c.858+5ins7) that previously scored as "unknown" in Erasmus Pompe Center database. Lastly, we found new mutations (c.1209 C>A, 2737dupG) in two patients carrying IVS 1-13T>G in the other allele. Systemic involvements are very rare in late-onset Pompe patients. Similarly, Pompe disease does not cause cognitive impairment in adult population. Homozygous IVS 1-13T>G mutation and c.547-39T>G mutation which are previously noted as "unknown" pathogenicities cause a more severe disease.	3 1 4
CDH1 Missense Variant c.1679C>G (p.T560R) Completely Disrupts Normal Splicing through Creation of a Novel 5' Splice Site. || Alleles Antigens, CD Base Sequence Cadherins DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree RNA Splice Sites RNA Splicing Sequence Deletion Stomach Neoplasms || Disease-causing germline mutations in CDH1 cause Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer (HDGC). For patients who meet the HDGC screening criteria, the identification and classification of the sequence variants found in CDH1 are critical for risk management of patients. In this report, we describe a germline CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant identified in a 50 year old man who was diagnosed with gastric cancer with a strong family history of gastric cancer (one living brother was diagnosed with gastric cancer at 63 and another brother died of gastric cancer at 45). cDNA analysis, involving fragment analysis and cloning, indicated that the p.T560R mutation created a novel 5' splice donor site, which led to a novel transcript with a 32 nucleotide deletion in exon 11. This abnormal transcript putatively produces a truncated CDH1 protein (E-cadherin) of 575 amino acids instead of 882. We also demonstrated that the variant completely abolishes normal splicing as the mutant allele does not generate any normal transcript. Furthermore, the CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant segregated with gastric cancer in all three family members affected with gastric cancer in this family. These results support the conclusion that CDH1 c.1679C>G (p.T560R) variant is a pathogenic mutation and contributes to HDGC through disruption of normal splicing.	2 4 0 3

With next-generation sequencing (NGS), sequencing capacity is no longer a limitation to molecular diagnosis. Instead, the rising number of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) poses challenges to clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We investigated the potential of an integrated pipeline combining NGS and the functional assessment of variants for the diagnosis of RASopathies. We included 63 Chinese patients with RASopathies that had previously tested negative for PTPN11 and HRAS mutations. In these patients, we performed a genetic analysis of genes associated with RASopathies using a multigene NGS panel and Sanger sequencing. For the VUSs, we evaluated evidence from genetic, bioinformatic and functional data. Twenty disease-causing mutations were identified in the 63 patients, providing a primary diagnostic yield of 31.7%. Four VUSs were identified in five patients. The functional assessment supported the pathogenicity of the RAF1 and RIT1 VUSs, while the significance of two VUSs in A2ML1 remained unclear. In summary, functional analysis improved the diagnostic yield from 31.7% to 36.5%. Although technically demanding and time-consuming, a functional genetic diagnostic analysis can ease the clinical translation of these findings to aid bedside interpretation.	4
