The clinical management of Type 2 Gaucher disease. || Acute neuronopathic Congenital ichthyosis Gaucher disease Hydrops fetalis Lysosomal storage disorder Palliative care || Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, is the most common of the lysosomal storage disorders. Type 2 Gaucher disease, the most severe and progressive form, manifests either prenatally or in the first months of life, followed by death within the first years of life. The rarity of the many lysosomal storage disorders makes their diagnosis a challenge, especially in the newborn period when the focus is often on more prevalent illnesses. Thus, a heightened awareness of the presentation of these rare diseases is necessary to ensure their timely consideration. This review, designed to serve as a guide to physicians treating newborns and infants with Gaucher disease, discusses the presenting manifestations of Type 2 Gaucher disease, the diagnostic work-up, associated genotypes and suggestions for management. We also address the ethical concerns that may arise with this progressive and lethal disorder, since currently available treatments may prolong life, but do not impact the neurological manifestations of the disease.	1 4 0
Cloning and characterization of human very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase cDNA, chromosomal assignment of the gene and identification in four patients of nine different mutations within the VLCAD gene. ||  || Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is one of four straight-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) enzymes, which are all nuclear encoded mitochondrial flavoproteins catalyzing the initial step in fatty acid beta-oxidation. We have used the very fast, Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) based strategy to obtain the sequence of cDNAs encoding human VLCAD from placenta and fibroblasts. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of human VLCAD with those of the other human ACD enzymes revealed extensive sequence homology. Moreover, human VLCAD and human acyl-CoA oxidase showed extensive sequence homology corroborating the notion that these genes are evolutionarily related. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from hybrid cell lines was used to localize the VLCAD gene to human chromosome 17p11.2-p11.13105. Using Northern and Western blot analysis to investigate the tissue specific distribution of VLCAD mRNA and protein in several human tissues we showed that VLCAD is most abundant in heart and skeletal muscle. This agrees well with the fact that cardiac and muscle symptoms are characteristic for patients with VLCAD deficiency. Northern blot analysis and sequencing of cloned PCR amplified VLCAD cDNA from four unrelated patients with VLCAD deficiency showed that VLCAD mRNA was undetectable in one patient and that the other three have mutations in both VLCAD alleles. Western blot analysis of patient fibroblasts showed that the identified mutations result in severely reduced amounts of VLCAD protein. None of the patients harbored identical mutations suggesting that the mutational heterogeneity in VLCAD deficiency is large.	1 3
Mammalian target of rapamycin pathway mutations cause hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia. ||  || Focal malformations of cortical development, including focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME), are important causes of intractable childhood epilepsy. Using targeted and exome sequencing on DNA from resected brain samples and nonbrain samples from 53 patients with FCD or HME, we identified pathogenic germline and mosaic mutations in multiple PI3K/AKT pathway genes in 9 patients, and a likely pathogenic variant in 1 additional patient. Our data confirm the association of DEPDC5 with sporadic FCD but also implicate this gene for the first time in HME. Our findings suggest that modulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway may hold promise for malformation-associated epilepsy.	4
Brain somatic mutations in MTOR cause focal cortical dysplasia type II leading to intractable epilepsy. ||  || Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a sporadic developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by dysmorphic neurons, dyslamination and medically refractory epilepsy. It has been hypothesized that FCD is caused by somatic mutations in affected regions. Here, we used deep whole-exome sequencing (read depth, 412-668×) validated by site-specific amplicon sequencing (100-347,499×) in paired brain-blood DNA from four subjects with FCDII and uncovered a de novo brain somatic mutation, mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) c.7280T>C (p.Leu2427Pro) in two subjects. Deep sequencing of the MTOR gene in an additional 73 subjects with FCDII using hybrid capture and PCR amplicon sequencing identified eight different somatic missense mutations found in multiple brain tissue samples of ten subjects. The identified mutations accounted for 15.6% of all subjects with FCDII studied (12 of 77). The identified mutations induced the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase. Focal cortical expression of mutant MTOR by in utero electroporation in mice was sufficient to disrupt neuronal migration and cause spontaneous seizures and cytomegalic neurons. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin suppressed cytomegalic neurons and epileptic seizures. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that brain somatic activating mutations in MTOR cause FCD and identifies mTOR as a treatment target for intractable epilepsy in FCD.	4 0
Inherited Disease Genetics Improves the Identification of Cancer-Associated Genes. ||  || The identification of biologically significant variants in cancer genomes is critical to therapeutic discovery, but it is limited by the statistical power needed to discern driver from passenger. Independent biological data can be used to filter cancer exomes and increase statistical power. Large genetic databases for inherited diseases are uniquely suited to this task because they contain specific amino acid alterations with known pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms. However, no rigorous method to overlay this information onto the cancer exome exists. Here, we present a computational methodology that overlays any variant database onto the somatic mutations in all cancer exomes. We validate the computation experimentally and identify novel associations in a re-analysis of 7362 cancer exomes. This analysis identified activating SOS1 mutations associated with Noonan syndrome as significantly altered in melanoma and the first kinase-activating mutations in ACVR1 associated with adult tumors. Beyond a filter, significant variants found in both rare cancers and rare inherited diseases increase the unmet medical need for therapeutics that target these variants and may bootstrap drug discovery efforts in orphan indications.	4 0
GJB2 mutations and degree of hearing loss: a multicenter study. ||  || Hearing impairment (HI) affects 1 in 650 newborns, which makes it the most common congenital sensory impairment. Despite extraordinary genetic heterogeneity, mutations in one gene, GJB2, which encodes the connexin 26 protein and is involved in inner ear homeostasis, are found in up to 50% of patients with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. Because of the high frequency of GJB2 mutations, mutation analysis of this gene is widely available as a diagnostic test. In this study, we assessed the association between genotype and degree of hearing loss in persons with HI and biallelic GJB2 mutations. We performed cross-sectional analyses of GJB2 genotype and audiometric data from 1,531 persons, from 16 different countries, with autosomal recessive, mild-to-profound nonsyndromic HI. The median age of all participants was 8 years; 90% of persons were within the age range of 0-26 years. Of the 83 different mutations identified, 47 were classified as nontruncating, and 36 as truncating. A total of 153 different genotypes were found, of which 56 were homozygous truncating (T/T), 30 were homozygous nontruncating (NT/NT), and 67 were compound heterozygous truncating/nontruncating (T/NT). The degree of HI associated with biallelic truncating mutations was significantly more severe than the HI associated with biallelic nontruncating mutations (P<.0001). The HI of 48 different genotypes was less severe than that of 35delG homozygotes. Several common mutations (M34T, V37I, and L90P) were associated with mild-to-moderate HI (median 25-40 dB). Two genotypes--35delG/R143W (median 105 dB) and 35delG/dela(GJB6-D13S1830) (median 108 dB)--had significantly more-severe HI than that of 35delG homozygotes.	1
Incidental finding of severe hypertriglyceridemia in children. Role of multiple rare variants in genes affecting plasma triglyceride. || APOA5 Familial chylomicronemia Hypertriglyceridemia LIPC and APOB genes LPL Targeted next-generation sequencing || The incidental finding of severe hypertriglyceridemia (HyperTG) in a child may suggest the diagnosis of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a recessive disorder of the intravascular hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. FCS may be due to pathogenic variants in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as in other proteins, such as apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein A-V (activators of LPL), GPIHBP1 (the molecular platform required for LPL activity on endothelial surface) and LMF1 (a factor required for intracellular formation of active LPL). Molecular characterization of 5 subjects in whom HyperTG was an incidental finding during infancy/childhood. We performed the parallel sequencing of 20 plasma TG-related genes. Three children with severe HyperTG were found to be compound heterozygous for rare pathogenic LPL variants (2 nonsense, 3 missense, and 1 splicing variant). Another child was found to be homozygous for a nonsense variant of APOA5, which was also found in homozygous state in his father with longstanding HyperTG. The fifth patient with a less severe HyperTG was found to be heterozygous for a frameshift variant in LIPC resulting in a truncated Hepatic Lipase. In addition, 1 of the patients with LPL deficiency and the patient with APOA-V deficiency were also heterozygous carriers of a pathogenic variant in LIPC and LPL gene, respectively, whereas the patient with LIPC variant was also a carrier of a rare APOB missense variant. Targeted parallel sequencing of TG-related genes is recommended to define the molecular defect in children presenting with an incidental finding of HyperTG.	4 2
Genetic and clinical characteristics of Chinese children with Glucokinase-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY). || Children Chinese Genetics Glucokinase MODY || There is scarcity of information on the clinical features and genetics of glucokinase-maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY) in China. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics of Chinese children with GCK-MODY. Eleven children with asymptomatic hyperglycemia and clinically suspected GCK-MODY were identified from the database of children with diabetes in the biggest children's hospital in South China. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Blood was collected from the patients and their parents for glucokinase (GCK) gene analysis. Parents without diabetes were tested for fasting glucose and HbA1c. Clinical information and blood for GCK gene analysis were obtained from grandparents with diabetes. GCK gene mutational analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Patients without a GCK gene mutation were screened by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for other MODY genes. Nine children tested positive for GCK gene mutations while two were negative. The nine GCK-MODY patients were from unrelated families, aged 1 month to 9 years and 1 month at first detection of hyperglycaemia. Fasting glucose was elevated (6.1-8.5 mmol/L), HbA1c 5.2-6.7% (33.3-49.7 mmol/mol), both remained stable on follow-up over 9 months to 5 years. Five detected mutations had been previously reported: p.Val182Met, c.679 + 1G > A, p.Gly295Ser, p.Arg191Gln and p.Met41Thr. Four mutations were novel: c.483 + 2 T > A, p.Ser151del, p.Met57GlyfsX29 and p.Val374_Ala377del. No mutations were identified in the other two patients, who were also tested by NGS. GCK gene mutations are detected in Chinese children and their family members with typical clinical features of GCK-MODY. Four novel mutations are detected.	4 2
Clinical heterogeneity in ethylmalonic encephalopathy. ||  || Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is a recently described inborn error of metabolism characterized clinically by developmental delay and regression, recurrent petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, and chronic diarrhea. We describe monochorionic twins presenting with hypotonia in infancy and diagnosed with ethylmalonic encephalopathy on the basis of biochemical findings. They are compound heterozygote for missense mutations in ETHE1. Magnetic resonance imaging changes affecting the white matter, corpus callosum, and basal ganglia were seen in both patients. At 10 years of age, they have severe axial hypotonia but never displayed petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, or chronic diarrhea. Their clinical courses differ markedly; one had an episode of coma when she was 3 years old and now has spastic quadraparesis and cannot speak. The other can freely use her upper extremities, her pyramidal syndrome being mostly limited to the lower extremities, and can speak 2 languages. These patients illustrate the clinical heterogeneity of ethylmalonic encephalopathy, even in monochorionic twins.	1
High frequency of pathogenic and rare sequence variants in diabetes-related genes among Russian patients with diabetes in pregnancy. || Diabetes in pregnancy Monogenic forms of diabetes Next-generation sequencing Non-obese pregnant women || Diabetes in pregnancy may be associated with monogenic defects of beta-cell function, frequency of which depends on ethnicity, clinical criteria for selection of patients as well as methods used for genetic analysis. The aim was to evaluate the contribution and molecular spectrum of mutations among genes associated with monogenic diabetes in non-obese Russian patients with diabetes in pregnancy using the next-generation sequencing (NGS). 188 non-obese pregnant women with diabetes during pregnancy were included in the study; among them 57 subjects (30.3%) met the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria of preexisting pregestational diabetes (pre-GDM), whereas 131 women (69.7%) fulfilled criteria of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A custom NGS panel targeting 28 diabetes causative genes was used for sequencing. The sequence variants were rated according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. In total, 23 pathogenic, 18 likely pathogenic and 16 variants of uncertain significance were identified in 59/188 patients (31.4%). The majority of variants (38/59) were found in GCK gene. No significant differences in the number of variants among the two study groups (pre-GDM and GDM) were observed. The study suggests that frequency of monogenic variants of diabetes might be underestimated, which warrants a broader use of genetic testing, especially in pregnancy.	4
Identification and characterization of novel low-density lipoprotein receptor mutations of familial hypercholesterolaemia patients in Taiwan. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease associated with a very high risk of coronary vascular disease. The study objective was to identify patients with FH in Taiwan and characterize novel mutations. Fifty-one patients with suspected FH living in Taiwan were screened for mutations in both the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the apolipoprotein (apoB) genes using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction and exon-by-exon DNA sequencing technique. Functional consequences on LDL receptor activity were characterized in vitro for novel mutations and family pedigree was also analyzed. Thirteen different functional mutations in the LDL receptor gene and one mutation in the apoB gene were found in 21 patients. Among the 13 mutations in the LDL receptor gene, 10 were single-point missense mutations, one was a two-point mutation in the same allele, one was a non-sense mutation and one was a frame-shift mutation. There were three novel mutations, including two missense mutations (M510K and W512R) and one frame-shift mutation (1953 delTA mutation). The characterization of missense M510K retained 36.2% of the activity of the normal receptor. Conversely, frame-shift 1953 delTA and missense W512R led to defective proteins, with only 0-6% of normal receptor activity. The study identified 13 LDL receptor gene mutations and characterized three novel mutations causing FH in Taiwan. This facilitated a better understanding of FH among the Chinese population and may enable diagnosis of FH at the molecular level at a presymptomatic, early age.	4
Degradation of the LDL receptor class 2 mutants is mediated by a proteasome-dependent pathway. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder that results from various gene mutations, primarily within the LDL receptor (LDLR). Approximately 50% of the LDLR mutations are defined as class 2 mutations, with the mutant proteins partially or entirely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. To determine the degradation pathway of the LDLR class 2 mutants, we examined the effects of inhibition of several potential pathways on the levels of the wild-type LDLR and its four representative class 2 mutants (S156L, C176Y, E207K, and C646Y) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We found that proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin blocked the degradation of the LDLR mutants, but not that of the wild-type LDLR. Treatment of CHO cells with these proteasome inhibitors led to a significant accumulation of the mutants at steady state. Furthermore, cell surface levels of the LDLR mutants were significantly increased upon inhibition of the proteasome degradation pathway. In contrast to the proteasome inhibitors, inhibitors of trypsin-like proteases, chymotrypsin-like proteases, and lysosomal pathway inhibitors did not affect the levels of the LDLR mutants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the proteasome is the principal degradation pathway for LDLR class 2 mutants.	0
Mapping the genetic and clinical characteristics of Gaucher disease in the Iberian Peninsula. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is due to deficiency of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. It is panethnic, but its presentation reveals ethnicity-specific characteristics. We evaluated the distribution, and clinical and genetic characteristics of GD patients in the Iberian Peninsula (IP). We analysed geographical distribution, demographic, genetic and clinical data, age at diagnosis, type, and years of therapy in 436 GD patients from the IP. The prevalence of GD was 1/149,000 inhabitants; 88.3% were type 1, 6.7% type 2, and 5.0% type 3. The mean age at diagnosis in type 1 was 28.7 years. A total of 72.7% were classified as having mild forms, 25.5% moderate, and 1.7% severe. Anemia and thrombocytopenia were present in 56% and 55%, respectively. Bone disease and hepatomegaly were reported in 62% and 68%, respectively, and were more likely in asplenic than in non-splenectomized patients. Sixty-nine mutant alleles were identified, and five mutations accounted for 75% of the GBA alleles. Several patients described in our series had interesting phenotypes. A total of 58.7% of patients had received enzyme replacement therapy and 12.6% were treated with miglustat. A broad spectrum of GBA mutations is present in the IP, with 98.2% of type 1 GD being mild and 23.0% never treated. These data highlight genetic and phenotypic heterogeneities among geographic populations.	1
Novel glucokinase gene mutation in the first Macedonian family tested for MODY. || GCK mutation GCK-MODY Mild hyperglycemia || We present a boy with mild hyperglycemia detected during an upper respiratory infection. Novel splicing mutation in the intron 1 of the GCK gene (c.45+1G>A) was detected, and was subsequently confirmed in his father. This is the first case of genetically confirmed Macedonian family with MODY.	4 2
Multimodal lipid-lowering treatment in pediatric patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia-target attainment requires further increase of intensity. || Children Familial hypercholesterolemia LDL-cholesterol Lipoprotein apheresis prevention Treatment || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) causes premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is recommended as first-line lipid-lowering treatment (LLT) for homozygous (ho) FH. Efficacy of multimodal LLT including lifestyle counseling, drug treatment, and LA was analyzed in 17 pediatric hoFH or compound heterozygous (c-het) FH patients, who commenced chronic LA in Germany before the age of 18. At time of diagnosis, mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration was 19.6 mmol/l (756 mg/dl). Multimodal LLT resulted in 73% reduction of mean LDL-C concentration including a 62% contribution of LA. Only three children (18%) achieved mean LDL-C concentrations below the recommended pediatric target of 3.5 mmol/l (135 mg/dl). In 13 patients (76%) during chronic LA, neither cardiovascular events occurred nor was CVD progression detected clinically or by routine imaging techniques. In four patients (24%), cardiovascular events documented progression of CVD despite weekly LA, including one death due to coronary and cerebrovascular CVD which was not stabilized after commencing LA. Based on the mutational status, only 6 out of the 17 children were candidates for proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition. Two already responded with further LDL-C decrease by 40%. Next to drug therapy, regular LA is an essential component of LLT for approaching LDL-C targets in children with hoFH or c-hetFH, which was successful only in a minority of children. Progression of CVD morbidity and resulting mortality remain unresolved issues. Early and intensified multimodal LLT guided by risk factors beyond LDL-C concentration is needed to improve outcome.	4
Femoral atherosclerosis in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: influence of the genetic defect. ||  || The purpose of this study was to assess femoral atherosclerosis by ultrasound in patients with molecularly defined heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in comparison with matched control subjects and in relation to mutational class in the LDL receptor and apolipoprotein B (APOB) genes. Femoral intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque were evaluated in 146 FH patients carrying null alleles (n=48), defective-receptor alleles (n=62), undetermined-function alleles (n=25), or APOB defects (n=11) and in 193 healthy subjects. Twenty-three patients had coronary heart disease (CHD). The frequency of both tendon xanthomas and CHD was approximately 2-fold higher and average LDL cholesterol was 30 mg/dL higher in null-allele genotype compared with receptor-defective mutations. All femoral measurements were increased in FH patients versus controls (P<0.001), and null-allele mutations showed higher age-, sex-, and LDL cholesterol-adjusted maximum IMT than receptor-defective or APOB defects (P for trend, 0.001). By multivariate analysis, independent associations of mean IMT, a measure of early atherosclerosis, were age, LDL cholesterol, sex, and systolic blood pressure. Age, null-allele genotype, sex, and smoking explained 42% of the variability of maximum IMT, a measure of advanced atherosclerosis. FH patients have increased femoral IMT in relation to mutational class. The findings support the usefulness of genetic testing in FH beyond securing the diagnosis.	4
Prevalence of mutations in renal developmental genes in children with renal hypodysplasia: results of the ESCAPE study. ||  || Renal hypodysplasia (RHD) is characterized by a reduced nephron number, small kidney size, and disorganized renal tissue. A hereditary basis has been established for a subset of affected patients, suggesting a major role of developmental genes that are involved in early kidney organogenesis. Gene mutations that have dominant inheritance and cause RHD, urinary tract anomalies, and defined extrarenal symptoms have been identified in TCF2 (renal cysts and diabetes syndrome), PAX2 (renal-coloboma syndrome), EYA1 and SIX1 (branchio-oto-renal syndrome), and SALL1 (Townes-Brocks syndrome). For estimation of the prevalence of these events, an unselected cohort of 99 unrelated patients with RHD that was associated with chronic renal insufficiency were screened for mutations in TCF2, PAX2, EYA1, SIX1, and SALL1. Mutations or variants in the genes of interest were detected in 17 (17%) unrelated families: One mutation, two variants, and four deletions of TCF2 in eight unrelated patients; four different PAX2 mutations in six families; one EYA1 mutation and one deletion in two patients with branchio-oto-renal syndrome; and one SALL1 mutation in a patient with isolated RHD. Of a total of 27 patients with renal cysts, six (22%) carried a mutation in TCF2. It is interesting that a SIX1 sequence variant was identified in two siblings with renal-coloboma syndrome as a result of a PAX2 mutation, suggesting an oligogenic inheritance. Careful clinical reevaluation that focused on discrete extrarenal symptoms and thorough family analysis revealed syndrome-specific features in nine of the 17 patients. In conclusion, 15% of patients with RHD show mutations in TCF2 or PAX2, whereas abnormalities in EYA1, SALL1, and SIX1 are less frequent.	4
Combining targeted panel-based resequencing and copy-number variation analysis for the diagnosis of inherited syndromic retinopathies and associated ciliopathies. ||  || Inherited syndromic retinopathies are a highly heterogeneous group of diseases that involve retinal anomalies and systemic manifestations. They include retinal ciliopathies, other well-defined clinical syndromes presenting with retinal alterations and cases of non-specific multisystemic diseases. The heterogeneity of these conditions makes molecular and clinical characterization of patients challenging in daily clinical practice. We explored the capacity of targeted resequencing and copy-number variation analysis to improve diagnosis of a heterogeneous cohort of 47 patients mainly comprising atypical cases that did not clearly fit a specific clinical diagnosis. Thirty-three likely pathogenic variants were identified in 18 genes (ABCC6, ALMS1, BBS1, BBS2, BBS12, CEP41, CEP290, IFT172, IFT27, MKKS, MYO7A, OTX2, PDZD7, PEX1, RPGRIP1, USH2A, VPS13B, and WDPCP). Molecular findings and additional clinical reassessments made it possible to accurately characterize 14 probands (30% of the total). Notably, clinical refinement of complex phenotypes was achieved in 4 cases, including 2 de novo OTX2-related syndromes, a novel phenotypic association for the ciliary CEP41 gene, and the co-existence of biallelic USH2A variants and a Koolen-de-Vries syndrome-related 17q21.31 microdeletion. We demonstrate that combining next-generation sequencing and CNV analysis is a comprehensive and useful approach to unravel the extensive phenotypic and genotypic complexity of inherited syndromic retinopathies.	4
A novel AKT3 mutation in melanoma tumours and cell lines. ||  || Recently, a rare activating mutation of AKT1 (E17K) has been reported in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers. However, analogous activating mutations in AKT2 or AKT3 have not been identified in any cancer lineage. To determine the prevalence of AKT E17K mutations in melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, we analysed 137 human melanoma specimens and 65 human melanoma cell lines for the previously described activating mutation of AKT1, and for analogous mutations in AKT2 and AKT3. We identified a single AKT1 E17K mutation. Remarkably, a previously unidentified AKT3 E17K mutation was detected in two melanomas (from one patient) as well as two cell lines. The AKT3 E17K mutation results in activation of AKT when expressed in human melanoma cells. This represents the first report of AKT mutations in melanoma, and the initial identification of an AKT3 mutation in any human cancer lineage. We have also identified the first known human cell lines with naturally occurring AKT E17K mutations.	0
Heterogeneous mutations in the human lipoprotein lipase gene in patients with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. ||  || The DNA sequences were determined for the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene from five unrelated Japanese patients with familial LPL deficiency. The results demonstrated that all five patients are homozygotes for distinct point mutations dispersed throughout the LPL gene. Patient 1 has a G-to-A transition at the first nucleotide of intron 2, which abolishes normal splicing. Patient 2 has a nonsense mutation in exon 3 (Tyr61----Stop) and patient 3 in exon 8 (Trp382----Stop). The latter mutation emphasizes the importance of the carboxy-terminal portion of the enzyme in the expression of LPL activity. Missense mutations were identified in patient 4 (Asp204----Glu) and patient 5 (Arg243----His) in the strictly conserved amino acids. Expression study of both mutant genes in COS-1 cells produced inactive enzymes, establishing the functional significance of the two mis-sense mutations. In these patients, postheparin plasma LPL mass was either virtually absent (patients 1 and 2) or significantly decreased (patients 3-5). To detect these mutations more easily, we developed a rapid diagnostic test for each mutation. We also determined the DNA haplotypes for patients and confirmed the occurrence of multiple mutations on the chromosomes with an identical haplotype. These results demonstrate that familial LPL deficiency is a heterogeneous genetic disease caused by a wide variety of gene mutations.	4 0
Insights into the structural biology of Gaucher disease. || Alpha-synuclein Glucocerebrosidase Lysosome Parkinson disease Protein structure || Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the acid-β-glucosidase lysosomal hydrolase enzyme that cleaves glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide. Reduced enzyme activity and impaired structural stability arise due to >300 known disease-causing mutations. Several of these mutations have also been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson disease (PD). Since the discovery of the acid-β-glucosidase X-ray structure, there have been major advances in our understanding of the structural properties of the protein. Analysis of specific residues has provided insight into their functional and structural importance and provided insight into the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and the contribution to PD. Disease-causing mutations are positioned throughout the acid-β-glucosidase structure, with many located far from the active site and thus retaining some enzymatic activity however, thus far no clear relationship between mutation location and disease severity has been established. Here, we review the crystal structure of acid-β-glucosidase, while highlighting important structural aspects of the protein in detail. This review discusses the structural stability of acid-β-glucosidase, which can be altered by pH and glycosylation, and explores the relationship between known Gaucher disease and PD mutations, structural stability and disease severity.	4 0
Genotype-phenotype associations in patients with severe hyperinsulinism of infancy. ||  || In hyperinsulinism of infancy (HI), unregulated insulin secretion causes hypoglycemia. Pancreatectomy may be required in severe cases, most of which result from a defect in the beta-cell KATP channel, encoded by ABCC8 and KCNJ11. Pancreatic histology may be classified as diffuse or focal disease (the latter associated with single paternal ABCC8 mutations), indicated by the presence of islet cell nuclear enlargement in areas of diffuse abnormality. We investigated genotype-phenotype associations in a heterogeneous Australian cohort. ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were sequenced and case histology was reviewed in 21 infants who had pancreatectomy. Ninety-eight control DNA samples were tested by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Eighteen ABCC8 mutations were identified, 10 novel. Eleven patients (4 compound heterozygote, 4 single mutation, 3 no mutation detected) had diffuse hyperinsulinism. Nine patients had focal hyperinsulinism (6 single paternal mutation, 2 single mutation of undetermined parental origin, 1 none found) with absence of islet cell nuclear enlargement outside the focal area, although centroacinar cell proliferation and/or nesidiodysplasia was present in 7 cases. Regeneration after near-total pancreatectomy was documented in 4 patients, with aggregates of endocrine tissue observed at subsequent operations in 3. Although the absence of enlarged islet cell nuclei is a useful discriminant of focal hyperinsulinism associated with a paternal ABCC8 mutation, further research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of other histological abnormalities in patients with HI, which may have implications for mechanisms of ductal and islet cell proliferation. Previous surgery should be taken into account when interpreting pancreatic histology.	4
Glucokinase gene mutation screening in Argentinean clinically characterized MODY patients. ||  || Mutations in the glucokinase gene (GCK) produce a subtype of Maturity onset diabetes in the young (MODY), named MODY 2. To date over than 190 different mutations have been identified, distributed over the coding regions and the exon-intron boundaries of the gene. The aim of this work was to study the nature and frequency of mutations in the GCK gene, in a MODY clinically characterized Argentinean population. Seventy unrelated individuals were selected based on MODY clinical features. The study methodology consisted in PCR amplification of the coding regions of the GCK gene, SSCP electrophoresis analysis of the amplified fragments and direct sequencing of the fragments with abnormal electrophoresis pattern. We identified a total of six patients with mutations in the GCK gene. This included two novel mutations: g.1831C>A, g.3792T>A, one already reported by our group, g.168fsdelC (same mutation in two non-related patients) and two already reported: p.Gln138Pro and p.Gly261Glu. With that data, we could establish the prevalence of MODY 2 among the patients in study reaching to 8.6%. The main contribution of this study is to inform about two novel mutations not described to date and to make an approach to the establishment of the prevalence of MODY 2 in the population under study. These findings contribute to confirm the allelic heterogeneity of GCK gene mutations and may provide an insight into the structure-function relationship of the GCK.	4
Mutations in the PCSK9 gene in Norwegian subjects with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. ||  || Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is at a locus for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, and recent data indicate that the PCSK9 gene is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations within this gene have previously been found to segregate with hypercholesterolemia. In this study, DNA sequencing of the 12 exons of the PCSK9 gene has been performed in 51 Norwegian subjects with a clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia where mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and mutation R3500Q in the apolipoprotein B-100 gene had been excluded. Two novel missense mutations were detected in the catalytic subdomain of the PCSK9 gene. Two patients were heterozygotes for D374Y, and one patient was a double heterozygote for D374Y and N157K. D374Y segregated with hypercholesterolemia in the two former families where family members were available for study. Our findings support the notion that mutations in the PCSK9 gene cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.	4 2
Degradation of LDLR protein mediated by 'gain of function' PCSK9 mutants in normal and ARH cells. ||  || Dominant gain-of-function mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) cause familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and result in accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease. It is believed that PCSK9 binds to LDL-receptor (LDLR) protein and prevents its recycling to the cell surface; gain-of-function PCSK9 mutants enhance LDLR degradation. Several new variants of PCSK9 have been identified, but their effect on PCSK9 activity has not been determined. We describe a new procedure for assessing the activity of four putative gain-of-function mutations identified in FH patients (D129N, D374H, N425S, R496W). All four mutant proteins were secreted normally from transfected HEK293T cells. Immortalized lymphocytes from normolipaemic controls were incubated with conditioned medium from transfected cells and cell-surface LDLR protein was determined by FACS. D374H was as potent as D374Y in reducing cell-surface LDLR, while the other three mutations were more potent than wild type, but less so than the D374 mutants; this correlated with total serum cholesterol in the patients. Substitution of different amino acids at 374 showed that aspartate in this position was critical; even glutamate at residue 374 increased LDLR degradation. When the assay was carried out with ARH-negative lymphocytes that are unable to internalise the LDLR, D374Y-PCSK9 was able to reduce cell-surface LDLR by 35%, compared with approximately 70% for normal lymphocytes. Thus, PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation is not entirely dependent on ARH function. We propose a novel ARH-independent pathway for PCSK9 activity on LDLR.	4 0
Identification of novel therapeutic targets in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma using targeted next generation sequencing. ||  || Understanding genetic aberrations in cancer leads to discovery of new targets for cancer therapies. The genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully described. Therefore, patients with refractory advanced/metastatic HCC referred for experimental therapies, who had adequate tumor tissue available, had targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of their tumor samples using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine, MA) and their treatment outcomes were analyzed. In total, NGS was obtained for 14 patients (median number of prior therapies, 1) with advanced/metastatic HCC. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71%) were men, 4 (29%) women, 6 (43%) had hepatitis B or C-related HCC. NGS revealed at least 1 molecular abnormality in 12 patients (range 0-8, median 2). Detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (n=3 [mTOR, PIK3CA, NF1]), Wnt pathway (n=6 [CTNNA1, CTNNB1]), MAPK pathway (n=2 [MAP2K1, NRAS]), and aberrant DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control and apoptosis (n=18 [ATM, ATR, BAP1, CCND1, CDKN2A, CDK4, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MCL1, MDM2, RB1, TP53]). Of the 3 patients with molecular aberrations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 2 received therapies including a mTOR inhibitor and all demonstrated therapeutic benefit ranging from a partial response to minor shrinkage per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively). In conclusion, genomic alterations are common in advanced HCC. Refractory patients with alterations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway demonstrated early signals of clinical activity when treated with therapies targeting mTOR.	4
Analysis of LDL receptor gene mutations in Italian patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || The aim of this study was the characterization of mutations of the LDL receptor gene in 39 Italian patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who were examined during the period 1994 to 1996. The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 64 years; one third of them were older than 30. Plasma LDL cholesterol level ranged from 10.8 to 25.1 mmol/L. The residual LDL receptor activity, measured in cultured fibroblasts of 32 patients, varied from <2% to 30% of normal and was inversely correlated with the plasma LDL cholesterol level (r=-0.665; P<0.003). The most severe coronary atherosclerosis was observed in those patients with the lowest residual LDL receptor activity (</=5% of normal) and the highest plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Twenty-nine patients (23 of whom were unrelated) were found to be homozygotes at the LDL receptor locus. In this group we discovered 2 major rearrangements and 12 different point mutations (9 in the coding region and 3 in splice sites). Some mutations (D200G, C358R, V502M, G528D, and P664L) were found in 3 or more unrelated patients. Patients with the same mutation shared the same haplotype at the LDL receptor gene locus and came from the same geographic area. Ten patients (9 of whom were unrelated) were found to be compound heterozygotes. The mutations found in this group consisted of one large deletion and 12 point mutations (11 in the coding sequence and one in a splice site). In 3 compound heterozygotes we failed to identify the second mutant allele at the LDL receptor locus. These observations confirm the allelic heterogeneity underlying familial hypercholesterolemia in the Italian population and indicate that the variability of phenotypic expression of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is, to a large extent, related to the type of mutation of the LDL receptor gene.	4
Severe hypertriglyceridaemia as a result of familial chylomicronaemia: the Cape Town experience. ||  || Lipoprotein lipase deficiency causes severe hypertriglyceridaemia due to chylomicronaemia, and leads to recurrent and potentially life-threatening pancreatitis. This disorder can only be managed by dietary fat restriction as drugs are ineffective. We review the experience with familial chylomicronaemia in patients who attended the lipid clinics at Groote Schuur Hospital and Red Cross Children's War Memorial Hospital in Cape Town. Criteria for inclusion were an initial plasma triglyceride concentration of >15 mmol/l and a typical type I Fredrickson hyperlipidaemia pattern on plasma lipoprotein electrophoresis. A total of 29 patients were seen over 25 years. The mean age of presentation was 10 years, but ranged from 0 to 43 years. The modes of presentation differed: pancreatitis (N=16), eruptive xanthomata (N=2), coincidental detection of hypertriglyceridaemia (N=2), screening relatives (N=7), and after death from pancreatitis (N=1). Plasma triglycerides responded rapidly and dramatically to dietary fat restriction, and some patients sustained good control of the hyperlipidaemia. The onset of pancreatitis was earlier in patients of Indian ancestry, suggesting a genotype/phenotype interaction within this disorder. Genetic work-up indicated founder effects in the Afrikaner and Indian patients. Lipaemic plasma should be taken seriously at all ages, and necessitates work-up at specialised clinics where the diagnosis of chylomicronaemia or type I hyperlipidaemia facilitates appropriate dietary management that can prevent pancreatitis.	4
The spectrum of clinical disease caused by the A467T and W748S POLG mutations: a study of 26 cases. ||  || We studied 26 patients belonging to 20 families with a disorder caused by mutations in the POLG gene. The patients were homozygous for 1399 G/A or 2243 G/C (giving the amino acid changes A467T and W748S, respectively) or compound heterozygotes for these two mutations. Irrespective of genotype, the patients exhibited a progressive neurological disorder usually starting in their teens and characterized by epilepsy, headache, ataxia, neuropathy, myoclonus and late onset ophthalmoplegia. However, major differences in survival were seen depending on genotype, with compound heterozygotes having a significantly shorter survival time than patients homozygous either for the A467T or W748S (P = 0.006). Epilepsy occurred in 22 of the 26 patients and in the majority of these there was an occipital EEG focus. Episodes of both generalized and focal motor status epilepticus were common and highly resistant to treatment, even with generalized anaesthesia. Status epilepticus was the recorded cause of death in 9 of 11 patients. Liver failure was the sole cause of death in two patients and evolved terminally in six others, all but one of whom were being treated with sodium valproate. Two patients underwent liver transplantation, but only one survived. Delayed psychomotor development and subsequent cognitive decline also occurs. This study demonstrates the clinical spectrum of a disorder that combines features of Alpers' syndrome and a later onset mitochondrial spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy and headache. Patients with this disorder are at high risk of death from status epilepticus and from liver failure, if exposed to sodium valproate. Each mutation appears capable of producing a disorder that is recessively inherited, although we also find evidence in one patient suggesting that heterozygotes may manifest. Compound heterozygotes have a significantly more severe phenotype raising the possibility of a dominant negative effect.	1
Genotype-phenotype relationships in patients with type I hyperlipoproteinemia. || Apolipoprotein A5 Familial chylomicronemia syndrome GPIHBP1 Lipoprotein lipase Type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia || Type I hyperlipoproteinemia (T1HLP) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extreme hypertriglyceridemia that fails to respond to lipid-lowering agents, predisposing to frequent attacks of acute pancreatitis. Mutations in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein CII (APOC2), lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1), glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), and apolipoprotein AV (APOA5) cause T1HLP, but we lack data on phenotypic variations among the different genetic subtypes. To study genotype-phenotype relationships among subtypes of T1HLP patients. Genetic screening for mutations in LPL, APOC2, GPIHBP1, LMF1, and APOA5. Tertiary referral center. Ten patients (7 female, 3 male) with chylomicronemia, serum triglyceride levels about 2000 mg/dL, and no secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Genotyping and phenotypic features. Four patients harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in LPL, 3 had homozygous mutations in GPIHBP1, and 1 had a heterozygous APOA5 mutation. We failed to fully identify the genetic etiology in 2 cases: 1 had a heterozygous LPL mutation only and another did not have any mutations. We identified 2 interesting phenotypic features: the patient with heterozygous APOA5 mutation normalized triglyceride levels with weight loss and fish oil therapy, and all 7 female patients were anemic. Our data suggest the possibility of novel loci for T1HLP. We observed that heterozygous APOA5 mutation can cause T1HLP but such patients may unexpectedly respond to therapy, and females with T1HLP suffer from anemia. Further studies of larger cohorts may elucidate more phenotype-genotypes relationships among T1HLP subtypes.	4
Mutation analysis in familial hypercholesterolemia patients of different ancestries: identification of three novel LDLR gene mutations. ||  || Twelve familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients of different ancestries living in South Africa were subjected to mutation analysis of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Nine different mutations were identified in 10 patients. Six of these, including the founder-related mutation C660X identified in two Lebanese patients, have previously been described in other FH patients with compatible genetic backgrounds, and/or in patients originating from countries where admixture is not uncommon. Characterization of an abnormal electrophoresis pattern detected in exon 4 of the LDLR gene by heteroduplex single-strand conformation polymorphism (HEX-SSCP) analysis, revealed a novel G deletion at codon 185 (617delG) which resulted in a downstream stop codon. Two of the new mutations identified resulted in amino acid substitutions and were designated R57C and Q357P.	4
Antagonism of secreted PCSK9 increases low density lipoprotein receptor expression in HepG2 cells. ||  || PCSK9 is a secreted protein that degrades low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) in liver by binding to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the LDLR. It is not known whether PCSK9 causes degradation of LDLRs within the secretory pathway or following secretion and reuptake via endocytosis. Here we show that a mutation in the LDLR EGF-A domain associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, H306Y, results in increased sensitivity to exogenous PCSK9-mediated cellular degradation because of enhanced PCSK9 binding affinity. The crystal structure of the PCSK9-EGF-A(H306Y) complex shows that Tyr-306 forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-374 in PCSK9 at neutral pH, which strengthens the interaction with PCSK9. To block secreted PCSK9 activity, LDLR (H306Y) subfragments were added to the medium of HepG2 cells stably overexpressing wild-type PCSK9 or gain-of-function PCSK9 mutants associated with hypercholesterolemia (D374Y or S127R). These subfragments blocked secreted PCSK9 binding to cell surface LDLRs and resulted in the recovery of LDLR levels to those of control cells. We conclude that PCSK9 acts primarily as a secreted factor to cause LDLR degradation. These studies support the concept that pharmacological inhibition of the PCSK9-LDLR interaction extracellularly will increase hepatic LDLR expression and lower plasma low density lipoprotein levels.	0
Somatic uniparental disomy of Chromosome 16p in hemimegalencephaly. || hemimegalencephaly pachygyria || Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is a heterogeneous cortical malformation characterized by enlargement of one cerebral hemisphere. Somatic variants in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulatory genes have been implicated in some HME cases; however, ∼70% have no identified genetic etiology. Here, we screened two HME patients to identify disease-causing somatic variants. DNA from leukocytes, buccal swabs, and surgically resected brain tissue from two HME patients were screened for somatic variants using genome-wide genotyping arrays or sequencing of the protein-coding regions of the genome. Functional studies were performed to evaluate the molecular consequences of candidate disease-causing variants. Both HME patients evaluated were found to have likely disease-causing variants in DNA extracted from brain tissue but not in buccal swab or leukocyte DNA, consistent with a somatic mutational mechanism. In the first case, a previously identified disease-causing somatic single nucleotide in <i>MTOR</i> was identified. In the second case, we detected an overrepresentation of the alleles inherited from the mother on Chromosome 16 in brain tissue DNA only, indicative of somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) of the p-arm of Chromosome 16. Using methylation analyses, an imprinted locus on 16p spanning <i>ZNF597</i> was identified, which results in increased expression of <i>ZNF597</i> mRNA and protein in the brain tissue of the second case. Enhanced mTOR signaling was observed in tissue specimens from both patients. We speculate that overexpression of maternally expressed <i>ZNF597</i> led to aberrant hemispheric development in the patient with somatic UPD of Chromosome 16p possibly through modulation of mTOR signaling.	4
Psychopathological features in Noonan syndrome. || ADHD Anxiety Behavioural phenotype Depression Noonan syndrome || Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short stature, skeletal and haematological/lymphatic defects, distinctive facies, cryptorchidism, and a wide spectrum of congenital heart defects. Recurrent features also include variable cognitive deficits and behavioural problems. Recent research has been focused on the assessment of prevalence, age of onset and characterization of psychiatric features in this disorder. Herein, we evaluated the prevalence of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depressive symptoms and syndromes in a cohort of individuals with clinical and molecular diagnosis of NS. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS PL) has been used for the assessment of psychiatric disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) have been assessed for the evaluation of anxiety and depressive symptoms and syndromes, whereas Conners Teacher and Parent Rating Scales-long version (CRS-R) have been used to evaluate ADHD. The study included 27 individuals (67% males) with an average age of 10.4 years (range 6-18 years) receiving molecular diagnosis of NS or a clinically related condition, evaluated and treated at the Neuropsychiatric Unit of Children's Hospital Bambino Gesù and at the Center for Rare Diseases of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli, in Rome. Twenty individuals showed mutations in PTPN11, five in SOS1 and two in SHOC2. The mean IQ was 94 (Standard Deviation = 17, min = 56, max = 130). Seventy percent of the individuals (n = 19; 95% Confidence Interval = 52-85%) showed ADHD features, with six individuals reaching DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD disorder, and thirteen showing subsyndromal traits. Symptoms or syndrome of anxiety were present in 37% of the cohort (n = 10; 95% Confidence Interval = 19-56%), with two individuals showing anxiety disorder and eight cases exhibiting subsyndromal traits. Our results show individuals with NS do present a very high risk to develop psychiatric disorders or symptoms during paediatric age. Based on these findings, preschool assessment of inattentive, hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety/depressive symptoms is recommended in order to plan a personalized treatment for psychological/psychiatric issues in affected individuals. Dedicated prospective studies are required to confirm the present data and better characterize the psychopathological profile in NS.	4
Molecular spectrum of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in France. ||  || Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia (ADH), characterized by isolated elevation of plasmatic LDL cholesterol and premature cardiovascular complications, is associated with mutations in 3 major genes: LDLR (LDL receptor), APOB (apolipoprotein B) and PCSK9(proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9). Through the French ADH Research Network, we collected molecular data from 1358 French probands from eleven different regions in France.Mutations in the LDLR gene were identified in 1003 subjects representing 391 unique events with 46.0% missense, 14.6% frameshift, 13.6% splice, and 11.3% nonsense mutations, 9.7% major rearrangements, 3.8% small in frame deletions/insertions, and 1.0% UTR mutations. Interestingly,175 are novel mutational events and represent 45% of the unique events we identified, highlighting a specificity of the LDLR mutation spectrum in France. Furthermore, mutations in the APOB gene were identified in 89 probands and in the PCSK9 gene in 10 probands. Comparison of available clinical and biochemical data showed a gradient of severity for ADH-causing mutations:FH=PCSK9>FDB>«Others» genes. The respective contribution of each known gene to ADH inthis French cohort is: LDLR 73.9%, APOB 6.6%, PCSK9 0.7%. Finally, in 19.0% of the probands,no mutation was found, thus underscoring the existence of ADH mutations located in still unknown genes.	4
Respiratory manifestations in late-onset Pompe disease: a case series conducted in Brazil. ||  || To describe respiratory function in a series of patients with late-onset Pompe disease after the definitive diagnosis and before enzyme replacement therapy. This was a cross-sectional study involving patients with a definitive molecular diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease. The data analyzed included age at symptom onset; age at definitive diagnosis; type of initial symptoms; time from symptom onset to diagnosis; FVC in the sitting and supine positions; six-minute walk distance; and locomotor ability. Analyses were carried out using frequencies, medians, minimum values, and maximum values. Six patients were included in the study. The median age at symptom onset was 15 years (range, 13-50 years), and the median age at diagnosis was 39.5 years (range, 10-64 years). The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 8 years (range, 0-45 years). In all cases, the initial manifestation of the disease had been motor weakness. The median FVC in percentage of the predicted value (FVC%) in the sitting and supine positions was 71.0% (range, 22.9-104.6%) and 58.0% (range, 10.9-106.9%), respectively. The median ΔFVC% was 24.5% (range, -4.59 to 52.40%).The median six-minute walk distance was 391.7 m (range, 97-702 m) . In this case series, the time from symptom onset to diagnosis was long. Although respiratory signs or symptoms were not the initial manifestations of the disease, 66.7% of the patients showed reduced FVC% in the sitting and supine positions at diagnosis.	1
Genetic Confirmation Rate in Clinically Suspected Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young. || corrélation génotype phénotype diabète monogénique genetics genotype-phenotype correlation génétique monogenic diabetes mutations next-generation DNA sequencing séquençage de l'ADN de nouvelle génération || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes, reportedly accounting for 2% to 5% of all cases of diabetes. In samples from Canadian patients referred for molecular genetic confirmation of a clinically suspected MODY, we determined the prevalence of likely disease-causing DNA variants in known MODY genes. Between 1999 and 2015, our centre received requests from colleagues for DNA sequencing of 96 samples from unrelated Canadian patients with clinically suspected MODY. Prior to 2012, we used Sanger sequencing, and since 2012 we have used targeted next-generation sequencing. Of 96 samples received, 39 (40.6%) had a likely rare causal variant in 1 of 8 known MODY genes. Of these, 20 (51.3%) and 19 (48.7%) were diagnosed by Sanger and targeted next-generation sequencing, respectively. The 39 mutation-positive samples had 1 of 39 rare variants, of which the majority were in genes encoding either glucokinase (GCK, or MODY2) or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1A, or MODY3). Furthermore, 12 (30.8%) of the detected rare variants had been unreported previously but were likely to have been clinically significant according to standard bioinformatic methods. An additional 6 samples had rare variants in MODY genes that were of uncertain clinical significance. The findings suggest that clinical suspicion for MODY has a diagnostic yield of ~40% at the molecular level. Confirmatory genetic testing in patients suspected to have MODY allows for definitive diagnoses which, in turn, may guide management and provide rationales for screening other family members presymptomatically.	4
Novel mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene of brazilian patients with Gaucher disease. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from glucocerebrosidase (GC) deficiency due to mutations in the gene (GBA) coding for this enzyme. We have developed a strategy for analyzing the entire GBA coding region and applied this strategy to 48 unrelated Brazilian patients with GD. We used long-range PCR, genotyping based on the Taqman® assay, nested PCR, and direct DNA sequencing to define changes in the gene. We report here seven novel mutations that are likely to be harmful: S125N (c.491G>A), F213L (c.756T>G), P245T (c.850C>A), W378C (c.1251G>C), D399H (c.1312G>C), 982-983insTGC (c.980_982dupTGC), and IVS10+1G>T (c.1505+1G>T). The last alteration was found as a complex allele together with a L461P mutation. We also identified 24 different mutations previously reported by others. G377S was the third most frequent mutation among the patients included in this study, after N370S and L444P. Therefore, this mutation needs be included in preliminary screens of Brazilian GD patients. The identification of mutant GBA alleles is crucial for increasing knowledge of the GBA mutation spectrum and for better understanding of the molecular basis of GD.	1 4
Resequencing the apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) gene in patients with various forms of hypertriglyceridemia. ||  || Genomewide association studies (GWAS), conventional association studies and the characterization of families with ApoA5 deficiency have shown that variation in the apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) gene is associated with plasma triglyceride levels. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of rare variants in the APOA5 gene in patients with various forms of hypertriglyceridemia. The DNA sequence of the exons plus exon/intron boundaries of the APOA5 gene of 291 patients with triglycerides above the 95th percentile for age and sex (98 of whom had triglycerides above 875 mg/dl), 111 patients with APOE2/2 genotype of whom 100 had Type III Hyperlipidemia and 108 probands with triglycerides below the 25th percentile for age and sex was determined. Twenty four variants were detected of which eight have been previously reported. There were nine patients with triglycerides above 875 mg/dl and nine patients with moderately elevated triglycerides who were carriers of at least one deleterious mutation in the APOA5 gene. Of the patients with Type III HLP, three (3%) were carriers of rare variants and there was a single rare variant detected in the group of probands with triglycerides below the 25th percentile for age and sex. Rare mutations in the APOA5 gene are more frequent in patients with elevated triglycerides than in those with Type III HLP.	4
Molecular genetic background of an autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in the Czech Republic. ||  || Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH), more known as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), is a lipid metabolism disorder characterized by an elevation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. In this study, we assessed a spectrum of mutations causing ADH in 3914 unrelated Czech patients with clinical diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. Samples have been collected within the framework of the MedPed project running in the Czech Republic since 1998. So far we have found 432 patients (11.0 %) with the APOB gene mutation p.(Arg3527Gln) and 864 patients (22.1 %) with the LDLR gene mutation. In 864 probands carrying the LDLR gene mutation, 182 unique allelic variants were detected. We have identified 14 patients homozygous for mutations in the LDLR or APOB genes. We performed function analyses of p.(Leu15Pro) and p.(Gly20Arg) sequence variations.	4
Mutation analysis and genotype/phenotype relationships of Gaucher disease patients in Spain. ||  || Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene cause Gaucher disease (GD). The aim of this study was to characterise the GBA mutations and analyze genotype/phenotype relationships in 193 unrelated patients from the Spanish GD Registry. We have identified 98.7% of the mutated GBA alleles, finding 56 different GBA mutations and 66 genotypes causing GD in Spain: 47 previously described mutations and 9 novel mutations (4 missense R395C, R463H, W312R and V398I, 1 nonsense R359X, 4 frameshift c.708delC, c.1214-1215delGC, c.1439-1445del7 and c.42-65del24). The most prevalent mutations were N370S and L444P, accounting for 68.7% of the mutated alleles. A wide phenotypic difference was observed within each genotypic group, and 9% of diagnosed type 1 patients developed neurological involvement including parkisonism, tremor, hypoacusia and eye movements. All of these findings indicate that there is a significant genotypic heterogeneity that explains the huge phenotypic variation among Spanish GD patients.	1 4
Novel glucokinase mutations in patients with monogenic diabetes - clinical outline of GCK-MD and potential for founder effect in Slavic population. ||  || Glucokinase (GCK) gene mutations are the causative factor of GCK-MD (monogenic diabetes) characterized by a mild clinical phenotype and potential for insulin withdrawal. This study presents the results of a nationwide genetic screening for GCK-MD performed in Poland. A group of 194 patients with clinical suspicion of GCK-MD and 17 patients with neonatal diabetes were subjected to GCK sequencing. Patients negative for GCK mutations were subjected to multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect deletions or insertions. A total of 44 GCK heterozygous mutations were found in 68 probands (35%). Among those, 20 mutations were novel ones: A282fs, D198V, E158X, G246V, G249R, I348N, L165V, L315Q, M115I, N254S, P284fs, Q338P, R377L, R43C, R46S, S212fs, S212P, T255N, V406A and Y214D. No abnormalities were detected in MLPA analysis. Homozygous D278E mutation was found in one patient with neonatal diabetes. The most frequently observed combinations of symptoms typical for GCK-MD were mild diabetes and/or fasting hyperglycaemia (98.3%), positive C-peptide at diagnosis (76%) and dominant mode of inheritance (59%). This study outlines numerous novel mutations of the GCK gene present in white Caucasians of Slavic origin. Thorough clinical assessment of known factors associated with GCK-MD may facilitate patient selection.	4 2
Post-mortem whole-exome analysis in a large sudden infant death syndrome cohort with a focus on cardiovascular and metabolic genetic diseases. ||  || Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is described as the sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy infant younger than one year of age. Genetic studies indicate that up to 35% of SIDS cases might be explained by familial or genetic diseases such as cardiomyopathies, ion channelopathies or metabolic disorders that remained undetected during conventional forensic autopsy procedures. Post-mortem genetic testing by using massive parallel sequencing (MPS) approaches represents an efficient and rapid tool to further investigate unexplained death cases and might help to elucidate pathogenic genetic variants and mechanisms in cases without a conclusive cause of death. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 161 European SIDS infants with focus on 192 genes associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Potentially causative variants were detected in 20% of the SIDS cases. The majority of infants had variants with likely functional effects in genes associated with channelopathies (9%), followed by cardiomyopathies (7%) and metabolic diseases (1%). Although lethal arrhythmia represents the most plausible and likely cause of death, the majority of SIDS cases still remains elusive and might be explained by a multifactorial etiology, triggered by a combination of different genetic and environmental risk factors. As WES is not substantially more expensive than a targeted sequencing approach, it represents an unbiased screening of the exome, which could help to investigate different pathogenic mechanisms within the genetically heterogeneous SIDS cohort. Additionally, re-analysis of the datasets provides the basis to identify new candidate genes in sudden infant death.	4
mTOR mutations in Smith-Kingsmore syndrome: Four additional patients and a review. || MINDS syndrome Smith-Kingsmore syndrome constitutive mosaicism germline mosaicism gonadal mosaicism mTOR macrocephaly megalencephaly somatic mosaicism || Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (SKS) OMIM #616638, also known as MINDS syndrome (ORPHA 457485), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder reported so far in 23 patients. SKS is characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly/hemi/megalencephaly, and seizures. It is also associated with a pattern of facial dysmorphology and other non-neurological features. Germline or mosaic mutations of the mTOR gene have been detected in all patients. The mTOR gene is a key regulator of cell growth, cell proliferation, protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity, and the mTOR pathway (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) is highly regulated and critical for cell survival and apoptosis. Mutations in different genes in this pathway result in known rare diseases implicated in hemi/megalencephaly with epilepsy, as the tuberous sclerosis complex caused by mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, or the PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). We here present 4 new cases of SKS, review all clinical and molecular aspects of this disorder, as well as some characteristics of the patients with only brain mTOR somatic mutations.	4
Generation of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from a patient with family history of diabetes carrying a C18R mutation in the PDX1 gene. ||  || Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the homeobox transcription factor PDX1 leads to pancreatic agenesis, whereas certain heterozygous point mutations are associated with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young 4 (MODY4) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). To understand the pathomechanism of MODY4 and T2DM, we have generated iPSCs from a woman with a C18R heterozygous mutation in the transactivation domain of PDX1. The resulting PDX1 C18R iPSCs generated by episomal reprogramming are integration-free, have a normal karyotype and are pluripotent in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, this iPSC line will be useful to study diabetes pathomechanisms.	4
Detection of variations and identifying genomic breakpoints for large deletions in the LDLR by Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing. || Alu Familial hypercholesterolaemia Genomic breakpoint mapping Ion Torrent PGM sequencing Low-density lipoprotein receptor || The aims of this study were to 1) compare LDLR variant detection between Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) sequencing and conventional methods used for familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) diagnosis i.e. exon-by-exon sequence analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and 2) identify genomic breakpoints for 12 cases of large deletions in LDLR previously identified by MLPA. Thirty FH patient samples were selected, 22 with mutations previously determined. Primers were designed and optimised to generate six amplicons covering the entire LDLR and sequenced on a PGM. An additional twelve samples carrying MLPA variants were sequenced on the PGM followed by Sanger sequencing to establish the breakpoints. A total of 2179 LDLR variants were identified in the 30 samples, with 383 variants in the region sequenced that was common to both PGM and Sanger methods. Three discrepancies were identified; two of these were identified by visual inspection of the BAM files, whilst the remaining discrepancy was likely an artefact of the PCR approach. Approximate genomic breakpoints for the 12 MLPA variants were identified using PGM sequencing, and Sanger sequencing of these regions established causative breakpoints. Eleven different rearrangements/mutational events were found, with eight out of eleven occurring in Alus. Two of the three samples with exons 2-6del had identical breakpoints. Two samples with exons 11-12del had unique breakpoints, indicating separate ancestral origin or mutational events. This study showed that Ion Torrent PGM sequencing is an accurate and efficient method to detect LDLR variants while providing additional information such as genomic breakpoints.	4
Synergy from gene expression and network mining (SynGeNet) method predicts synergistic drug combinations for diverse melanoma genomic subtypes. ||  || Systems biology perspectives are crucial for understanding the pathophysiology of complex diseases, and therefore hold great promise for the discovery of novel treatment strategies. Drug combinations have been shown to improve durability and reduce resistance to available first-line therapies in a variety of cancers; however, traditional drug discovery approaches are prohibitively cost and labor-intensive to evaluate large-scale matrices of potential drug combinations. Computational methods are needed to efficiently model complex interactions of drug target pathways and identify mechanisms underlying drug combination synergy. In this study, we employ a computational approach, SynGeNet (Synergy from Gene expression and Network mining), which integrates transcriptomics-based connectivity mapping and network centrality analysis to analyze disease networks and predict drug combinations. As an exemplar of a disease in which combination therapies demonstrate efficacy in genomic-specific contexts, we investigate malignant melanoma. We employed SynGeNet to generate drug combination predictions for each of the four major genomic subtypes of melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, NF1, and triple wild type) using publicly available gene expression and mutation data. We validated synergistic drug combinations predicted by our method across all genomic subtypes using results from a high-throughput drug screening study across. Finally, we prospectively validated the drug combination for <i>BRAF</i>-mutant melanoma that was top ranked by our approach, vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) + tretinoin (retinoic acid receptor agonist), using both in vitro and in vivo models of <i>BRAF</i>-mutant melanoma and RNA-sequencing analysis of drug-treated melanoma cells to validate the predicted mechanisms. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of disease domains, and, importantly, can model disease-relevant protein subnetworks in precision medicine contexts.	4
Identification of novel USH2A mutations: implications for the structure of USH2A protein. ||  || Usher syndrome type II is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by stable hearing impairment from childhood and progressive retinitis pigmentosa from the late teens. Mutations in the USH2A gene, located on 1q41, were recently shown to be responsible for Usher syndrome type IIa. We have investigated the molecular pathology of Usher type II by screening the USH2A gene for mutations in 31 unrelated patients from Denmark and Norway. Besides the frequent 2299delG mutation, which accounted for 44% of the disease alleles, a heterogeneous spectrum of mutations was identified. Sixteen new, putative disease-causing mutations were detected, of which 12 were private and four were shared by unrelated patients. The disease-causing mutations were scattered throughout the gene and included six nonsense and seven missense mutations, two deletions and one small insertion. In addition, six non-pathogenic polymorphisms were identified. All missense mutations resulted in major amino acid side-chain alterations. Four missense mutations affected the N-terminal part of USH2A, whereas three missense mutations affected the laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) domain. The structural consequences of the mutations affecting the LE domain are discussed in relation to the three-dimensional structure of a LE-module of the mouse laminin gamma1 chain.	4
Patients with type 1 Gaucher disease in South Florida, USA: demographics, genotypes, disease severity and treatment outcomes. ||  || Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive condition due to deficiency of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, is a multisystemic disease, with variable age of onset, severity and progression. It is classified into subtypes delineated by the absence (type 1) or presence (type 2 and 3) of primary nervous system involvement. The ethnically diverse, largely immigrant population in South Florida has a spectrum of Gaucher disease phenotypes, creating a challenge for optimization of disease management and an opportunity to explore treatment patterns. Ninety-three records from patients with Gaucher type I in South Florida were retrieved from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Registry. Individual genotypes were correlated with severity scores and success at achieving published therapeutic goals for haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen volume, liver volume and amelioration of bone pain and bone crises. The majority of patients were diagnosed during the fifth decade of life. Almost two-thirds were homozygous for the N370S mutation, reflecting the large Ashkenazi Jewish population in South Florida. The majority received imiglucerase (62.8%) at various intervals. 24.5% of patients underwent splenectomy before starting enzyme replacement therapy. After a median 12 treatment years, South Florida patients matched or exceeded the ICCG 4 year therapeutic goal achievement for platelet count (85.4% vs. 79.6% success), spleen volume (93.3% vs. 78.0% success), liver volume (93.4% vs. 90.6% success), and bone crises (100% vs. 99% success). Nevertheless, fewer patients with intact spleens had sustained achievement of all 6 therapeutic goals (30.4% versus 41.4%) and only 40% of the splenectomy patients sustained achievement of 5/5 possible goals. 54.7% of the intact spleen patients continued to have bone pain vs. 29.8% in ICCG. Significantly, only 37% of the ICGG patient cohort had bone pain prior to initiation of treatment compared to 73.4% of the South Florida patients (moderate or severe pain in 59.6%). Demographic characteristics are a significant determinant of the differences in response to treatment observed in South Florida Gaucher patients compared to those described in the international population enrolled in the ICGG Gaucher Registry. Individual genotypes and ethnic background are important considerations for optimizing patient care for Gaucher disease.	1 4 2
Low prevalence of mutations in known loci for autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in a multiethnic patient cohort. ||  || BACKGROUND- Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH), characterized by elevated plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, is caused by variants in at least 3 different genes: LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B-100, and proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9. There is paucity of data about the molecular basis of ADH among ethnic groups other than those of European or Japanese descent. Here, we examined the molecular basis of ADH in a multiethnic patient cohort from lipid clinics in a large, urban US city. METHODS AND RESULTS- A total of 38 men and 53 women, aged 22 to 76 years, met modified Simon-Broome criteria for ADH and were screened for mutations in the exons and consensus splice sites of LDLR, and in selected exons of apolipoprotein B-100 and proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9. Deletions and duplications of LDLR exons were detected with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Heterozygous variants in LDLR were identified in 30 patients and in apolipoprotein B-100 in 1 patient. The remaining 60 patients (65%) had unexplained ADH. A higher proportion of blacks (77%) than either non-Hispanic whites (57%) or Hispanics (53%) had unexplained ADH. Compared with patients with LDLR variants, those with unexplained ADH had lower levels of LDL-cholesterol (292 ± 47 mg/dL versus 239 ± 42 mg/dL, respectively; P<0.0001) and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (45 ± 12 mg/dL versus 54 ± 13 mg/dL, respectively; P=0.003). Our findings suggest that additional loci may contribute to ADH, especially in understudied populations such as blacks.	4
Extracellular LDLR repeats modulate Wnt signaling activity by promoting LRP6 receptor endocytosis mediated by the Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase. || Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase LDLRR LRP6 Wnt internalization sarcoma || The LOW-density lipoprotein related protein 6 (LRP6) receptor is an important effector of canonical Wnt signaling, a developmental pathway, whose dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases including cancer. The membrane proximal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor repeats in LRP6 exhibit homology to ligand binding repeats in the LDL receptor (LDLR), but lack known function. We generated single amino acid substitutions of LRP6-LDLR repeat residues, which are highly conserved in the human LDLR and mutated in patients with Familial Hypercholesteremia (FH). These substitutions negatively impacted LRP6 internalization and activation of Wnt signaling. By mass spectrometry, we observed that the Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with and ubiquitinated wild type LRP6 but not the LDLR repeat mutants. These findings establish the involvement of LRP6-LDLR repeats in the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling.	0
HDL cholesterol as a diagnostic tool for clinical differentiation of GCK-MODY from HNF1A-MODY and type 1 diabetes in children and young adults. ||  || Confirmation of monogenic diabetes caused by glucokinase mutations (GCK-MODY) allows pharmacogenetic intervention in the form of insulin discontinuation. This is especially important among paediatric and young adult populations where GCK-MODY is most prevalent. The study evaluated the utility of lipid parameters in screening for patients with GCK-MODY. Eighty-nine children with type 1 diabetes and 68 with GCK-MODY were screened for triglyceride (TG), total and HDL cholesterol levels. Standardization against a control group of 171 healthy children was applied to eliminate the effect of development. Clinical applicability and cut-off value were evaluated in all available patients with GCK-MODY (n = 148), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha-MODY (HNF1A MODY) (n = 37) or type 1 diabetes (n = 221). Lower lipid parameter values were observed in GCK-MODY than in patients with type 1 diabetes. Standard deviation scores were -0·22 ± 2·24 vs 1·31 ± 2·17 for HDL cholesterol (P < 0·001), -0·16 ± 2·14 vs 0·60 ± 1·77 for total cholesterol (P = 0·03) and -0·57 ± 0·97 vs-0·22 ± 0·97 for TG (P = 0·05). Validation analysis confirmed that HDL cholesterol was the best parameter for GCK-MODY selection [sensitivity 87%, specificity 54%, negative predictive value (NPV) 86%, positive PV 56%]. A threshold HDL concentration of 1·56 mm offered significantly better diagnostic efficiency than total cholesterol (cut-off value 4·51 mm; NPV 80%; PPV 38%; P < 0·001). TG did not offer a meaningful cut-off value. HDL cholesterol levels measured in individuals with likely monogenic diabetes may be useful in screening for GCK-MODY and differentiation from T1DM and HNF1A-MODY, regardless of treatment or metabolic control.	4
Founder mutations in the LDL receptor gene contribute significantly to the familial hypercholesterolemia phenotype in the indigenous South African population of mixed ancestry. ||  || The South African population harbors genes that are derived from varying degrees of admixture between indigenous groups and immigrants from Europe and the East. This study represents the first direct mutation-based attempt to determine the impact of admixture from other gene pools on the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) phenotype in the recently founded Coloured population of South Africa, a people of mixed ancestry. A cohort of 236 apparently unrelated patients with clinical features of FH was screened for a common mutation causing familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) and seven low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene defects known to be relatively common in South Africans with FH. Six founder-type 'South African mutations' were responsible for FH in approximately 20% of the study population, while only 1 patient tested positive for the familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 mutation R3500Q. The detection of multiple founder-type LDLR gene mutations originating from European, Indian and Jewish populations provides direct genetic evidence that Caucasoid admixture contributes significantly to the apparently high prevalence of FH in South African patients of mixed ancestry. This study contributes to our knowledge of the biological history of this unique population and illustrates the potential consequences of recent admixture in populations with different disease risks.	4
Familial partial lipodystrophy presenting as metabolic syndrome. || Dunnigan-type 2 familial partial lipodystrophy FPLD2 Lamin A C Metabolic syndrome || We report the first described case of a heterozygous p.R545H (c.1634 G > A) missense mutation in the LMNA gene with clinical features compatible with Dunnigan-type 2 familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2). The case presented as metabolic syndrome to a specialist clinical service and highlights the overlap between FPLD2 and the metabolic syndrome. The associations with type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypertriglyceridemia are highlighted. The importance of evaluating patients for these associated conditions is discussed, and the potential mechanisms of disease are briefly outlined. The mutation has been previously reported in a heart failure database without a clinical description. The links between heart failure and the clinical condition are briefly considered.	4
Three novel mutations in MODY and its phenotype in three different Czech families. ||  || MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young) is an autosomal dominant inherited type of diabetes with significant genetic heterogeneity. New mutations causing MODY are still being found. A genetically confirmed diagnosis of MODY allows application of individualized treatment based on the underlying concrete genetic dysfunction. Detection of novel MODY mutations helps provide a more complete picture of the possible MODY genotypes. We tested 43 adult Czech patients with clinical characteristics of MODY, using direct sequencing of HNF1A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha), HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha) and GCK (glucokinase) genes. In three Czech families we identified three novel mutations we believe causing MODY-two missense mutations in HNF1A [F268L (c.802T>C) and P291S (c.871C>T)] and one frame shift mutation in GCK V244fsdelG (c.729delG). Some of the novel HNF1A mutation carriers were successfully transferred from insulin to gliclazide, while some of the novel GCK mutation carriers had a good clinical response when switched from insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs to diet. We describe three novel MODY mutations in three Czech families. The identification of MODY mutations had a meaningful impact on therapy on the mutation carriers.	4
GBA Analysis in Next-Generation Era: Pitfalls, Challenges, and Possible Solutions. ||  || Mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme acid β-glucosidase (GBA) are responsible for Gaucher disease and represent the main genetic risk factor for developing Parkinson disease. In past years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has been applied for the molecular analysis of the GBA gene, both as a single gene or as part of gene panels. However, the presence of complex gene-pseudogene rearrangements, resulting from the presence of a highly homologous pseudogene (GBAP1) located downstream of the GBA gene, makes NGS analysis of GBA challenging. Therefore, adequate strategies should be adopted to avoid misdetection of GBA recombinant mutations. Here, we validated a strategy for the identification of GBA mutations using parallel massive sequencing and provide an overview of the major drawbacks encountered during GBA analysis by NGS. We implemented a NGS workflow, using a set of 38 patients with Gaucher disease carrying different GBA alleles identified previously by Sanger sequencing. As expected, the presence of the pseudogene significantly affected data output. However, the combination of specific procedures for the library preparation and data analysis resulted in maximal repeatability and reproducibility, and a robust performance with 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In conclusion, the pipeline described here represents a useful approach to deal with GBA sequencing using NGS technology.	1 4
Genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia using a rapid biochip array assay for 40 common LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 mutations. || Biochip array Familial hypercholesterolaemia Genetic diagnosis Mutation detection || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) leads to a lifelong increase in plasma LDL levels with subsequent increase in premature vascular disease. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to effective management of this condition. This research aims to produce a simple and cost effective genetic test which could identify the majority (71%) of mutations causing FH in the UK and Ireland. The Randox Biochip Array Technology was used to detect 40 point mutations in LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes, over two 5 × 5 arrays. This technology uses multiplex allele specific PCR and biochip array hybridisation, followed by a chemiluminescence detection system and software for automated mutation calling. The FH biochip array assay was validated in the Belfast Genetics Laboratory using 199 cascade screening samples previously sequenced for known FH causing family mutations, the overall sensitivity was 98%. The assay was then used for routine testing of 663 patients with possible FH, from clinics across the UK and Ireland. A total of 49 (7.4%) mutation positive individuals were identified, however, for the clinics in England the detection rate was 12.9%. Further analysis of 120 biochip negative patients, using DNA sequencing, did not identify any false negatives. The FH biochip array provides a rapid and reliable genetic test for the majority of FH causing point mutations in the UK and Ireland. A total of 32 samples can be run in 3 h. This allows clinics to evaluate additional patients for a possible diagnosis of FH such as patients with high LDL, patients with early onset coronary disease, and patients with relatives known to have FH.	4
Inheritance pattern of familial hypercholesterolemia and markers of cardiovascular risk. || atherosclerosis dyslipidemias epigenetics lipids lipoproteins pregnancy || Studies in children and adults have resulted in conflicting evidence in the quest for the answer to the hypothesis that offspring from hypercholesterolemic mothers might have an increased cardiovascular risk. Previous studies might have suffered from limitations such as cohort size and clinical sampling bias. We therefore explored this hypothesis in large cohorts of both subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and unaffected siblings in a wide age range. In three cohorts (cohort 1: n = 1,988, aged 0-18 years; cohort 2: n = 300, 8-30 years; cohort 3: n = 369, 18-60 years), we measured lipid and lipoproteins as well as carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) in offspring from FH mothers versus FH fathers. For LDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), and c-IMT, we performed a pooled analysis. No significant differences could be observed in c-IMT, lipid, or lipoprotein levels from offspring of FH mothers versus FH fathers. Pooled analyses showed no significant differences for either LDL cholesterol [mean difference 0.02 (-0.06,0.11) mmol/l, P = 0.60], TGs [mean difference 0.07 (0.00,0.14) mmol/l, P = 0.08], or c-IMT [mean difference -0.00 (-0.01,0.01) mm, P = 0.86]. Our data do not support the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk markers are different between offspring from FH mothers and FH fathers.	4
Spectrum of mutations in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in India, with four novel mutations. || Homozygous FH Mutation screening New mutations || Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a rare but serious, inherited disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by very high total and LDL cholesterol levels from birth. It presents as cutaneous and tendon xanthomas since childhood, with or without cardiac involvement. FH is commonly caused by mutations in three genes, i.e. LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and PCSK9. We aimed to determine the spectrum of mutations in cases of homozygous FH in Asian Indians and evaluate if there was any similarity to the mutations observed in Caucasians. Sixteen homozygous FH subjects from eleven families were analyzed for mutations by Sanger sequencing. Large rearrangements in LDLR gene were evaluated by multiplex ligation probe dependent amplification (MLPA) technique. Ten mutations were observed in LDLR gene, of which four mutations were novel. No mutation was detected in ApoB gene and common PCSK9 mutation (p.D374Y). Fourteen cases had homozygous mutations; one had compound heterozygous mutation, while no mutation was detected in one clinically homozygous case. We report an interesting "Triple hit" case with features of homozygous FH. The spectrum of mutations in the Asian Indian population is quite heterogeneous. Of the mutations identified, 40% were novel. No mutation was observed in exons 3, 9 and 14 of LDLR gene, which are considered to be hot spots in studies done on Asian Indians in South Africa. Early detection followed by aggressive therapy, and cascade screening of extended families has been initiated to reduce the morbidity and mortality in these patients.	4 2
Single amino-acid changes that confer constitutive activation of mTOR are discovered in human cancer. ||  || Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates a variety of cellular functions such as growth, proliferation and autophagy. In a variety of cancer cells, overactivation of mTOR has been reported. In addition, mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and its derivatives, are being evaluated in clinical trials as anticancer drugs. However, no active mutants of mTOR have been identified in human cancer. Here, we report that two different point mutations, S2215Y and R2505P, identified in human cancer genome database confer constitutive activation of mTOR signaling even under nutrient starvation conditions. S2215Y was identified in large intestine adenocarcinoma whereas R2505P was identified in renal cell carcinoma. mTOR complex 1 prepared from cells expressing the mutant mTOR after nutrient starvation still retains the activity to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 in vitro. The cells expressing the mTOR mutant show increased percentage of S-phase cells and exhibit resistance to cell size decrease by amino-acid starvation. The activated mutants are still sensitive to rapamycin. However, they show increased resistance to 1-butanol. Our study points to the idea that mTOR activating mutations can be identified in a wide range of human cancer.	0
Sequencing PDX1 (insulin promoter factor 1) in 1788 UK individuals found 5% had a low frequency coding variant, but these variants are not associated with Type 2 diabetes. ||  || Genome-wide association studies have identified >30 common variants associated with Type 2 diabetes (>5% minor allele frequency). These variants have small effects on individual risk and do not account for a large proportion of the heritable component of the disease. Monogenic forms of diabetes are caused by mutations that occur in <1:2000 individuals and follow strict patterns of inheritance. In contrast, the role of low frequency genetic variants (minor allele frequency 0.1-5%) in Type 2 diabetes is not known. The aim of this study was to assess the role of low frequency PDX1 (also called IPF1) variants in Type 2 diabetes. We sequenced the coding and flanking intronic regions of PDX1 in 910 patients with Type 2 diabetes and 878 control subjects. We identified a total of 26 variants that occurred in 5.3% of individuals, 14 of which occurred once. Only D76N occurred in >1%. We found no difference in carrier frequency between patients (5.7%) and control subjects (5.0%) (P=0.46). There were also no differences between patients and control subjects when analyses were limited to subsets of variants. The strongest subset were those variants in the DNA binding domain where all five variants identified were only found in patients (P=0.06). Approximately 5% of UK individuals carry a PDX1 variant, but there is no evidence that these variants, either individually or cumulatively, predispose to Type 2 diabetes. Further studies will need to consider strategies to assess the role of multiple variants that occur in <1 in 1000 individuals.	4
Missense mutations in the insulin promoter factor-1 gene predispose to type 2 diabetes. ||  || The transcription factor insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) plays a central role in both the development of the pancreas and the regulation of insulin gene expression in the mature pancreatic beta cell. A dominant-negative frameshift mutation in the IPF-l gene was identified in a single family and shown to cause pancreatic agenesis when homozygous and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) when heterozygous. We studied the role of IPF-1 in Caucasian diabetic and nondiabetic subjects from the United Kingdom. Three novel IPF-1 missense mutations (C18R, D76N, and R197H) were identified in patients with type 2 diabetes. Functional analyses of these mutations demonstrated decreased binding activity to the human insulin gene promoter and reduced activation of the insulin gene in response to hyperglycemia in the human beta-cell line Nes2y. These mutations are present in 1% of the population and predisposed the subject to type 2 diabetes with a relative risk of 3.0. They were not highly penetrant MODY mutations, as there were nondiabetic mutation carriers 25-53 years of age. We conclude that mutations in the IPF-1 gene may predispose to type 2 diabetes and are a rare cause of MODY and pancreatic agenesis, with the phenotype depending upon the severity of the mutation.	4 0 2
Gender-specific differences in major cardiac events and mortality in lamin A/C mutation carriers. ||  || Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause a variety of clinical phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy. LMNA is one of the most prevalent mutated genes in dilated cardiomyopathy, and is associated with a high risk of arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and heart failure. There are few data on the impact of age and gender on cardiac disease penetrance and mortality. In a multicentre cohort of 269 LMNA mutation carriers, we evaluated gender-specific penetrance of cardiac involvement and major cardiac events. All-cause mortality of mutation carriers [standardized mortality ratio (SMR)] was determined. Cardiac disease penetrance was age dependent and almost complete at the age of 70 years. The presence of an LVEF ≤45% was significantly higher in men (P < 0.001). However, there was no difference between genders in the prevalence of atrioventricular block, atrial tachyarrhythmias, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (26% vs. 8%) and end-stage heart failure (28% vs. 14%) were more common in men than in women (P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively). All-cause mortality of mutation carriers was significantly increased [SMR 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-5.2] between the ages of 15 and 75 years. Mortality in men was higher than in women (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.3). This large cohort of LMNA mutation carriers demonstrates a high cardiac disease penetrance and a high mortality in mutation carriers. Male mutation carriers have a worse prognosis due to a higher prevalence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and end-stage heart failure.	4
Intrauterine onset of acute neuropathic type 2 Gaucher disease: identification of a novel insertion sequence. ||  || A subset of patients with type 2 Gaucher disease is characterized by intrauterine onset of rapidly progressive neuropathic disease, arthrogryposis, hydrops fetalis and in some cases restrictive dermopathy. beta-Glucocerebrosidase (beta-glucosidase) activity is usually low or undetectable. In most cases death ensues either in-utero or within hours or days after birth. We report on an infant born to non-consanguineous parents of Caucasian origin presenting at birth with hydrops, arthrogryposis, severe respiratory distress, hepatosplenomegaly, and liver failure. Death occurred within several hours after delivery and autopsy revealed typical Gaucher cells in multiple organs in combination with severe apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the brain. beta-Glucocerebrosidase activity was 1% of the norm in fibroblasts and a novel heterozygous insertion c.1515_1516insAGTGAGGGCAAT was identified by genomic sequencing and an insertion-specific seminested PCR. In addition, molecular studies revealed a previously described in type 1 Gaucher disease missense mutation c.476G --> A which results in a heterozygous substitution of R120Q. Our observations confirm considerable genotypic heterogeneity in patients with type 2 Gaucher disease. The transheterozygous combination of a mutation, previously described in type 1 Gaucher disease, together with a newly identified insertion may result in this severe phenotype.	1 0
SOS1 and PTPN11 mutations in five cases of Noonan syndrome with multiple giant cell lesions. ||  || We report five cases of multiple giant cell lesions in patients with typical Noonan syndrome. Such association has frequently been referred to as Noonan-like/multiple giant cell (NL/MGCL) syndrome before the molecular definition of Noonan syndrome. Two patients show mutations in PTPN11 (p.Tyr62Asp and p.Asn308Asp) and three in SOS1 (p.Arg552Ser and p.Arg552Thr). The latter are the first SOS1 mutations reported outside PTPN11 in NL/MGCL syndrome. MGCL lesions were observed in jaws ('cherubism') and joints ('pigmented villonodular synovitis'). We show through those patients that both types of MGCL are not PTPN11-specific, but rather represent a low penetrant (or perhaps overlooked) complication of the dysregulated RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. We recommend discarding NL/MGCL syndrome from the nosology, as this presentation is neither gene-nor allele-specific of Noonan syndrome; these patients should be described as Noonan syndrome with MGCL (of the mandible, the long bone...). The term cherubism should be used only when multiple giant cell lesions occur without any other clinical and molecular evidence of Noonan syndrome, with or without mutations of the SH3BP2 gene.	4
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency: a new patient homozygote for the preponderant mutation Gly188Glu in the human LPL gene and review of reported mutations: 75 % are clustered in exons 5 and 6. ||  || We have investigated the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene of a 2-year-old patient presenting classical features of the familial LPL deficiency including undetectable LPL activity. DNA sequence analysis of exon 5 identified the patient as a homozygote for the Gly188Glu mutation, frequently involved in this disease. A review of cases of LPL deficiency with molecular study of the LPL gene showed a total number of 221 reported mutations involved in this disease. Gly188Glu was involved in 23.5 % of cases and 74.6 % of mutations were clustered in exons 5 and 6. Based on these observations, we propose a method of screening for mutations in this gene.	4
Control of leucine-dependent mTORC1 pathway through chemical intervention of leucyl-tRNA synthetase and RagD interaction. ||  || Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS) is known to function as leucine sensor in the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. However, the pathophysiological significance of its activity is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the leucine sensor function for mTORC1 activation of LRS can be decoupled from its catalytic activity. We identified compounds that inhibit the leucine-dependent mTORC1 pathway by specifically inhibiting the GTPase activating function of LRS, while not affecting the catalytic activity. For further analysis, we selected one compound, BC-LI-0186, which binds to the RagD interacting site of LRS, thereby inhibiting lysosomal localization of LRS and mTORC1 activity. It also effectively suppressed the activity of cancer-associated MTOR mutants and the growth of rapamycin-resistant cancer cells. These findings suggest new strategies for controlling tumor growth that avoid the resistance to existing mTOR inhibitors resulting from cancer-associated MTOR mutations.Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS) is a leucine sensor of the mTORC1 pathway. Here, the authors identify inhibitors of the GTPase activating function of LRS, not affecting its catalytic activity, and demonstrate that the leucine sensor function of LRS can be a new target for mTORC1 inhibition.	0
Mutations of AKT3 are associated with a wide spectrum of developmental disorders including extreme megalencephaly. || AKT3 epilepsy hemimegalencephaly megalencephaly polymicrogyria || Mutations of genes within the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-MTOR pathway are well known causes of brain overgrowth (megalencephaly) as well as segmental cortical dysplasia (such as hemimegalencephaly, focal cortical dysplasia and polymicrogyria). Mutations of the AKT3 gene have been reported in a few individuals with brain malformations, to date. Therefore, our understanding regarding the clinical and molecular spectrum associated with mutations of this critical gene is limited, with no clear genotype-phenotype correlations. We sought to further delineate this spectrum, study levels of mosaicism and identify genotype-phenotype correlations of AKT3-related disorders. We performed targeted sequencing of AKT3 on individuals with these phenotypes by molecular inversion probes and/or Sanger sequencing to determine the type and level of mosaicism of mutations. We analysed all clinical and brain imaging data of mutation-positive individuals including neuropathological analysis in one instance. We performed ex vivo kinase assays on AKT3 engineered with the patient mutations and examined the phospholipid binding profile of pleckstrin homology domain localizing mutations. We identified 14 new individuals with AKT3 mutations with several phenotypes dependent on the type of mutation and level of mosaicism. Our comprehensive clinical characterization, and review of all previously published patients, broadly segregates individuals with AKT3 mutations into two groups: patients with highly asymmetric cortical dysplasia caused by the common p.E17K mutation, and patients with constitutional AKT3 mutations exhibiting more variable phenotypes including bilateral cortical malformations, polymicrogyria, periventricular nodular heterotopia and diffuse megalencephaly without cortical dysplasia. All mutations increased kinase activity, and pleckstrin homology domain mutants exhibited enhanced phospholipid binding. Overall, our study shows that activating mutations of the critical AKT3 gene are associated with a wide spectrum of brain involvement ranging from focal or segmental brain malformations (such as hemimegalencephaly and polymicrogyria) predominantly due to mosaic AKT3 mutations, to diffuse bilateral cortical malformations, megalencephaly and heterotopia due to constitutional AKT3 mutations. We also provide the first detailed neuropathological examination of a child with extreme megalencephaly due to a constitutional AKT3 mutation. This child has one of the largest documented paediatric brain sizes, to our knowledge. Finally, our data show that constitutional AKT3 mutations are associated with megalencephaly, with or without autism, similar to PTEN-related disorders. Recognition of this broad clinical and molecular spectrum of AKT3 mutations is important for providing early diagnosis and appropriate management of affected individuals, and will facilitate targeted design of future human clinical trials using PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors.	4
Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in Chinese MODY families: prevalence and functional analysis. ||  || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes characterised by an early age of onset (usually <25 years). We investigated the prevalence and trans-activating activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) -1 alpha mutations in southern Chinese families with MODY. We screened for mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene in 50 unrelated southern Chinese families, which fulfilled the minimum criteria for MODY. Functional properties of the mutant proteins were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase reporter assay. Five of the 50 (10%) families were found to have mutations in the coding region, including a new nonsense mutation Q176X and four reported mutations (frameshift mutation P379fsdelCT, nonsense mutation R171X, missense mutations G20R and P112L). These mutations had decreased trans-activating activity on the human insulin gene promoter. We also detected a new intronic sequence variation IVS7nt-6 G-->A, which co-segregated with diabetes. The intronic variation creates a potential splice acceptor site and might alter the splicing of the HNF-1 alpha mRNA. Mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene seem to be an important cause of MODY in southern Chinese. The mutations could affect normal islet function by altering the expression of target genes.	4 0
SOS1 is the second most common Noonan gene but plays no major role in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. ||  || Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in various genes encoding proteins of the Ras-MAPK signalling cascade have been identified as the genetic basis of Noonan syndrome (NS) and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS). Mutations of SOS1, the gene encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, have been the most recent discoveries in patients with NS, but this gene has not been studied in patients with CFCS. We investigated SOS1 in a large cohort of patients with disorders of the NS-CFCS spectrum, who had previously tested negative for mutations in PTPN11, KRAS, BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2. Missense mutations of SOS1 were discovered in 28% of patients with NS. In contrast, none of the patients classified as having CFCS was found to carry a pathogenic sequence change in this gene. We have confirmed SOS1 as the second major gene for NS. Patients carrying mutations in this gene have a distinctive phenotype with frequent ectodermal anomalies such as keratosis pilaris and curly hair. However, the clinical picture associated with SOS1 mutations is different from that of CFCS. These findings corroborate that, despite being caused by gain-of-function mutations in molecules belonging to the same pathway, NS and CFCS scarcely overlap genotypically.	4 2
A specific and potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase for substrate inhibition therapy of Gaucher disease. ||  || An approach to treating Gaucher disease is substrate inhibition therapy which seeks to abate the aberrant lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide. We have identified a novel inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (Genz-112638) and assessed its activity in a murine model of Gaucher disease (D409V/null). Biochemical characterization of Genz-112638 showed good potency (IC(50) approximately 24nM) and specificity against the target enzyme. Mice that received drug prior to significant accumulation of substrate (10 weeks of age) showed reduced levels of glucosylceramide and number of Gaucher cells in the spleen, lung and liver when compared to age-matched control animals. Treatment of older mice that already displayed significant amounts of tissue glucosylceramide (7 months old) resulted in arrest of further accumulation of the substrate and appearance of additional Gaucher cells in affected organs. These data indicate that substrate inhibition therapy with Genz-112638 represents a viable alternate approach to enzyme therapy to treat the visceral pathology in Gaucher disease.	0
Features of <i>GBA</i>-associated Parkinson's disease at presentation in the UK <i>Tracking Parkinson's</i> study. ||  || To examine the influence of the glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA</i>) mutation carrier state on age at onset of Parkinson's disease (PD), the motor phenotype and cognitive function at baseline assessment in a large cohort of UK patients. We also analysed the prevalence of mood and behavioural problems that may confound the assessment of cognitive function. We prospectively recruited patients with PD in the <i>Tracking Parkinson's</i> study. We fully sequenced the <i>GBA</i> gene in all recently diagnosed patients (≤3.5 years). We examined cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and motor (Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part 3) function at a baseline assessment, at an average of 1.3 years after diagnosis. We used logistic regression to determine predictors of PD with mild cognitive impairment and PD with dementia. We studied 1893 patients with PD: 48 (2.5%) were heterozygous carriers for known Gaucher's disease (GD) causing pathogenic mutations; 117 (6.2%) had non-synonymous variants, previously associated with PD, and 28 (1.5%) patients carried variants of unknown significance in the <i>GBA</i> gene. L444P was the most common pathogenic <i>GBA</i> mutation. Patients with pathogenic <i>GBA</i> mutations were on average 5 years younger at disease onset compared with non-carriers (P=0.02). PD patients with GD-causing mutations did not have an increased family risk of PD. Patients with <i>GBA</i> mutations were more likely to present with the postural instability gait difficulty phenotype compared with non-carriers (P=0.02). Patients carrying pathogenic mutations in <i>GBA</i> had more advanced Hoehn and Yahr stage after adjustment for age and disease duration compared with non-carriers (P=0.005). There were no differences in cognitive function between <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers and non-carriers at this early disease stage. Our study confirms the influence of <i>GBA</i> mutations on the age of onset, disease severity and motor phenotype in patients with PD. Cognition did not differ between <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers and non-carriers at baseline, implying that cognitive impairment/dementia, reported in other studies at a later disease stage, is not present in recently diagnosed cases. This offers an important window of opportunity for potential disease-modifying therapy that may protect against the development of dementia in <i>GBA</i>-PD. NCT02881099; Results.	4
Juvenile onset acid maltase deficiency presenting as a rigid spine syndrome. ||  || The rigid spine syndrome is a disorder characterized by proximal muscle weakness and limitation in flexion of the cervical and dorsolumbar spine. Such phenotype may be caused by a variety of hereditary myopathies. We present the case of a 15-years-old boy with rigid spine syndrome and severe restrictive respiratory changes. Muscle biopsy revealed vacuolar myopathy with excessive deposition of PAS-positive material. Lysosomal acid maltase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts was reduced to 6% of control values. DNA analysis demonstrated novel mutation E888X of acid alpha-glucosidase gene with compound heterozygosity IVS1/E888X, confirming diagnosis of Pompe disease. We conclude that acid maltase deficiency should be considered in the diagnosis of rigid spine syndrome.	1 4
Mutation analysis in 36 unrelated Spanish subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia: identification of 3 novel mutations in the LDL receptor gene. ||  || We used the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method to investigate 36 apparently unrelated Spanish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) for mutations in the promoter region and the 18 exons and their flanking intron sequences of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Nineteen aberrant SSCP patterns were found, and the underlying mutations were characterized by DNA sequencing. In addition, we tested all patients for the presence of mutations in the gene coding for apolipoprotein B (apo B). Five missense mutations (Q71E, S156L, E256K, N543H and T705I), four nonsense mutations (W(-18)X, E10X, Q133X and C255X), six frameshift mutations (211delG, 518delG, 1045delC, 2085del19, 2207insT and 2393del9) and five splicing mutations (313+1G->C, 1061-8T->C, 1845+1G->C, 2140+5G->A and 2390-1G->C) were identified in the LDLR gene. In total, we detected 20 mutations, 3 of which, designated 1045delC, 1845+1G->C and 2207insT, have not been previously described. Seven patients were found to carry two different mutations in the same allele: W(-18)X and E256K (one patient), Q71E and 313+1G->C (two patients), 1061-8T->C and T705I (two patients), 518delG and 2140+5G->A (one patient) and N543H and 2393del9 (one patient). As we expected, there is a broad spectrum of mutations in the LDLR gene, given the genetic heterogeneity of the Spanish population.	4
Exome sequencing identifies rare LDLR and APOA5 alleles conferring risk for myocardial infarction. ||  || Myocardial infarction (MI), a leading cause of death around the world, displays a complex pattern of inheritance. When MI occurs early in life, genetic inheritance is a major component to risk. Previously, rare mutations in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) genes have been shown to contribute to MI risk in individual families, whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with MI risk in the population. Here we evaluate how rare mutations contribute to early-onset MI risk in the population. We sequenced the protein-coding regions of 9,793 genomes from patients with MI at an early age (≤50 years in males and ≤60 years in females) along with MI-free controls. We identified two genes in which rare coding-sequence mutations were more frequent in MI cases versus controls at exome-wide significance. At low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 4.2-fold increased risk for MI; carriers of null alleles at LDLR were at even higher risk (13-fold difference). Approximately 2% of early MI cases harbour a rare, damaging mutation in LDLR; this estimate is similar to one made more than 40 years ago using an analysis of total cholesterol. Among controls, about 1 in 217 carried an LDLR coding-sequence mutation and had plasma LDL cholesterol > 190 mg dl(-1). At apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 2.2-fold increased risk for MI. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein C-III (refs 18, 19). Combined, these observations suggest that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes to MI risk.	4
Spectrum of GBA mutations in patients with Gaucher disease from Slovakia: identification of five novel mutations. ||  || Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disorder and is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of undegraded substrates, mainly in cells of the monocyte/ macrophage lineage, which is responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. To date, no study has attempted to identify the mutation spectrum of the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) in Slovak patients To identify mutations in 14 Slovak patients with confirmed glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Using molecular genetics methods PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) and direct sequencing of coding region GBA we identified the spectrum of mutations in our patients. Five mutations (N370S, L444P, G377S, D409H and RecNciI) accounted for 75% of the mutant alleles. The remaining 25% were rare and probably individual mutations. The mutational spectrum in our patients is similar to that observed in other European countries and corresponds to a Caucasian population, with N370S, L444P, RecNciI being the most common. Interestingly, mutation G377S was more frequent in our patients as compared to other published data. The C4W, L96P, H311N, 745delG and 1127_1128delTT mutations are described here for the first time in Gaucher disease, contributing to the panel of published GBA mutations.	1 4 3
CLAPO syndrome: identification of somatic activating PIK3CA mutations and delineation of the natural history and phenotype. || CLAPO PIK3CA overgrowth somatic mosaicism vascular malformation || CLAPO syndrome is a rare vascular disorder characterized by capillary malformation of the lower lip, lymphatic malformation predominant on the face and neck, asymmetry, and partial/generalized overgrowth. Here we tested the hypothesis that, although the genetic cause is not known, the tissue distribution of the clinical manifestations in CLAPO seems to follow a pattern of somatic mosaicism. We clinically evaluated a cohort of 13 patients with CLAPO and screened 20 DNA blood/tissue samples from 9 patients using high-throughput, deep sequencing. We identified five activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene in affected tissues from 6 of the 9 patients studied; one of the variants (NM_006218.2:c.248T>C; p.Phe83Ser) has not been previously described in developmental disorders. We describe for the first time the presence of somatic activating PIK3CA mutations in patients with CLAPO. We also report an update of the phenotype and natural history of the syndrome.	4
A molecular genetic service for diagnosing individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in the United Kingdom. ||  || A genetic diagnostic service for familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) has been established over the last 4 years in the Clinical Molecular Genetics Laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust (GOSH), London. In total there have been 368 referrals; 227 probands and 141 family members, which have come from a number of lipid clinics and from general practitioners. FH is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR) and these are analysed by SSCP, DNA sequencing and direct assays. The clinically indistinguishable disorder, familial defective apolipoprotein B100 (FDB) is caused by one of three mutations in the apolipoprotein B100 gene (APOB) which are analysed by direct assays. Mutations predicted to be pathogenic were found in 76 probands, 67 in LDLR (23 previously undescribed) and nine in APOB. The mutation detection rate was 53% in paediatric probands, 32% in adults with a 'definite' FH diagnosis (tendon xanthoma positive) and 14% in adults with a 'possible' FH diagnosis (tendon xanthoma negative). The predicted loss of sensitivity that would result from reducing the number of exons tested has been assessed, and a molecular screening strategy suitable for UK patients is proposed. A similar strategy may be useful for other countries where genetic heterogeneity results in a wide mutation spectrum for FH.	4
RASopathy Gene Mutations in Melanoma. ||  || Next-generation sequencing of melanomas has unraveled critical driver genes and genomic abnormalities, mostly defined as occurring at high frequency. In addition, less abundant mutations are present that link melanoma to a set of disorders, commonly called RASopathies. These disorders, which include neurofibromatosis and Noonan and Legius syndromes, harbor germline mutations in various RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway genes. We highlight shared amino acid substitutions between this set of RASopathy mutations and those observed in large-scale melanoma sequencing data, uncovering a significant overlap. We review the evidence that these mutations activate the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in melanoma and are involved in melanomagenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the observations that two or more RASopathy mutations often co-occur in melanoma and may act synergistically on activating the pathway.	4
Visual perception skills: a comparison between patients with Noonan syndrome and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. || Developmental disorders dorsal stream form coherence genetic syndromes genotype intellectual disability motion coherence phenotype ventral stream visual-perceptual abilities || Ventral and dorsal streams are visual pathways deputed to transmit information from the photoreceptors of the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus and then to the primary visual cortex (V1). Several studies investigated whether one pathway is more vulnerable than the other during development, and whether these streams develop at different rates. The results are still discordant. The aim of the present study was to understand the functionality of the dorsal and the ventral streams in two populations affected by different genetic disorders, Noonan syndrome (NS) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), and explore the possible genotype-phenotype relationships. 'Form coherence' abilities for the ventral stream and 'motion coherence' abilities for the dorsal stream were evaluated in 19 participants with NS and 20 participants with 22q11.2DS. Collected data were compared with 55 age-matched controls. Participants with NS and 22q11.2DS did not differ in the form coherence task, and their performance was significantly lower than that of controls. However, in the motion coherence task, the group with NS and controls did not differ, and both obtained significantly higher scores than the group with 22q11.2DS. Our findings indicate that deficits in the dorsal stream are related to the specific genotype, and that in our syndromic groups the ventral stream is more vulnerable than the dorsal stream.	4
Gaucher disease mouse models: point mutations at the acid beta-glucosidase locus combined with low-level prosaposin expression lead to disease variants. ||  || Gaucher disease is a common lysosomal storage disease caused by a defect of acid beta-glucosidase (GCase). The optimal in vitro hydrolase activity of GCase requires saposin C, an activator protein that derives from a precursor, prosaposin. To develop additional models of Gaucher disease and to test in vivo effects of saposin deficiencies, mice expressing low levels (4--45% of wild type) of prosaposin and saposins (PS-NA) were backcrossed into mice with specific point mutations (V394L/V394L or D409H/D409H) of GCase. The resultant mice were designated 4L/PS-NA and 9H/PS-NA, respectively. In contrast to PS-NA mice, the 4L/PS-NA and 9H/PS-NA mice displayed large numbers of engorged macrophages and nearly exclusive glucosylceramide (GC) accumulation in the liver, lung, spleen, thymus, and brain. Electron microscopy of the storage cells showed the characteristic tubular storage material of Gaucher cells. Compared with V394L/V394L mice, 4L/PS-NA mice that expressed 4--6% of wild-type prosaposin levels had approximately 25--75% decreases in GCase activity and protein in liver, spleen, and fibroblasts. These results imply that reduced saposin levels increased the instability of V394L or D409H GCases and that these additional decreases led to large accumulations of GC in all tissues. These models mimic a more severe Gaucher disease phenotype and could be useful for therapeutic intervention studies.	0
Parkinsonism associated with glucocerebrosidase mutation. || Gaucher's disease Parkinson's diseases glucocerebroside || Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations of the β-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA). There is increasing evidence that GBA mutations are a genetic risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). We report herein a family of Koreans exhibiting parkinsonism-associated GBA mutations. A 44-year-old woman suffering from slowness and paresthesia of the left arm for the previous 1.5years, visited our hospital to manage known invasive ductal carcinoma. During a preoperative evaluation, she was diagnosed with Gaucher's disease and double mutations of S271G and R359X in GBA. Parkinsonian features including low amplitude postural tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia and shuffling gait were observed. Genetic analysis also revealed that her older sister, who had also been diagnosed with PD and had been taking dopaminergic drugs for 8-years, also possessed a heterozygote R359X mutation in GBA. (18)F-fluoropropylcarbomethoxyiodophenylnortropane positron-emission tomography in these patients revealed decreased uptake of dopamine transporter in the posterior portion of the bilateral putamen. This case study demonstrates Korean familial cases of PD with heterozygote mutation of GBA, further supporting the association between PD and GBA mutation.	1
Diffuse type gastric and lobular breast carcinoma in a familial gastric cancer patient with an E-cadherin germline mutation. ||  || E-Cadherin alterations have been reported frequently in sporadic diffuse type gastric and lobular breast carcinomas. Germline mutations of this gene have been identified recently in several gastric cancer families. We analyzed seven patients with a family history of the disease who had diffuse type gastric cancer diagnosed before the age of 45 for germline mutations in CDH1, the gene encoding the E-cadherin protein. We identified a frameshift mutation in exon 3 in one patient with a strong family history of gastric cancer. The same germline mutation was found in the patient's mother, who had metachronous development of lobular breast and diffuse type gastric carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin protein expression revealed an abnormal staining pattern in both of these tumors, suggesting complete inactivation of the cell adhesion molecule. Thus, our finding suggests that besides diffuse type gastric cancer, lobular breast carcinomas may be associated with germline CDH1 mutations.	4
Evidence for effect of mutant PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B secretion as the cause of unusually severe dominant hypercholesterolaemia. ||  || Typically, autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or apolipoprotein B genes that result in defective clearance of plasma LDL by the liver, but a third gene (PCSK9), encoding a putative proprotein convertase, has recently been implicated. Two independent microarray studies support a role for PCSK9 in sterol metabolism and adenoviral-mediated over-expression of PCSK9 in mouse liver depletes hepatic LDL-receptor protein, but the mechanism by which dominant mutations cause human FH is unclear. We have identified the D374Y mutant of PCSK9 in three FH families of English origin; all 12 affected individuals have unusually severe hypercholesterolaemia and require more stringent treatment than typical FH patients, who are heterozygous for defects in the LDL receptor. We have stably expressed wild-type (WT) and variant PCSK9 in McArdle-7777 rat hepatoma cells and shown by confocal microscopy that all forms of PCSK9 co-localize with protein disulphide isomerase in the ER whether or not they can be autocleaved. Expression of the proposed pathogenic variants, but not of WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9, increases secretion of apolipoprotein B100-containing lipoproteins from the cells by 2-4-fold probably by reducing the degradation of nascent protein; no differences in LDL-receptor content were observed in cells expressing WT, S386A or F216L PCSK9 and only a small reduction in cells expressing the D374Y or S127R mutants. This suggests that the variants of PCSK9 found in FH influence the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins, providing an explanation for the marked increase in circulating LDL in heterozygous carriers.	4 0
Clinical Diversity in Focal Congenital Hyperinsulinism in Infancy Correlates With Histological Heterogeneity of Islet Cell Lesions. || congenital hyperinsulinism focal hypoglycaemia insulin islet pancreas positron emission tomography β-cell || <b>Background:</b> Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) is an important cause of severe and persistent hypoglycaemia in infancy and childhood. The focal form (CHI-F) of CHI can be potentially cured by pancreatic lesionectomy. While diagnostic characteristics of CHI-F pancreatic histopathology are well-recognized, correlation with clinical phenotype has not been established. <b>Aims:</b> We aimed to correlate the diversity in clinical profiles of patients with islet cell organization in CHI-F pancreatic tissue. <b>Methods:</b> Clinical datasets were obtained from 25 patients with CHI-F due to <i>ABCC8/KCNJ11</i> mutations. <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET-CT was used to localize focal lesions prior to surgery. Immunohistochemistry was used to support protein expression studies. <b>Results:</b> In 28% (<i>n</i> = 7) of patient tissues focal lesions were amorphous and projected into adjoining normal pancreatic tissue without clear delineation from normal tissue. In these cases, severe hypoglycaemia was detected within, on average, 2.8 ± 0.8 (range 1-7) days following birth. By contrast, in 72% (<i>n</i> = 18) of tissues focal lesions were encapsulated within a defined matrix capsule. In this group, the onset of severe hypoglycaemia was generally delayed; on average 46.6 ± 14.3 (range 1-180) days following birth. For patients with encapsulated lesions and later-onset hypoglycaemia, we found that surgical procedures were curative and less complex. <b>Conclusion:</b> CHI-F is associated with heterogeneity in the organization of focal lesions, which correlates well with clinical presentation and surgical outcomes.	4
Hypertriglyceridaemia and low plasma HDL in a patient with apolipoprotein A-V deficiency due to a novel mutation in the APOA5 gene. ||  || APOA5 encodes a novel apolipoprotein (apo A-V) which appears to be a modulator of plasma triglyceride (TG). In apoA5 knock out mice plasma TG level increases almost fourfold, whereas in human APOA5 transgenic mice it decreases by 70%. Some SNPs in the APOA5 gene have been associated with variations in plasma TG in humans. In addition, hypertriglyceridaemic (HTG) patients have been identified who carried rare nonsense mutations in the APOA5 gene (Q139X and Q148X), predicted to result in apo A-V deficiency. In this study we report a 17-year-old male with high TG and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), who at the age of two had been found to have severe HTG and eruptive xanthomas suggesting a chylomicronaemia syndrome. Plasma postheparin LPL activity, however, was normal and no mutations were found in LPL and APOC2 genes. The sequence of APOA5 gene revealed that the patient was homozygous for a point mutation (c.289 C>T) in exon 4, converting glutamine codon at position 97 into a termination codon (Q97X). Apo A-V was not detected in patient's plasma, indicating that he had complete apo A-V deficiency. The administration of a low-fat and low-oligosaccharide diet, either alone or supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids, started early in life, reduced plasma TG to a great extent but had a negligible effect on plasma HDL-C. Loss of function mutations of APOA5 gene may be the cause of severe HTG in patients without mutations in LPL and APOC2 genes.	4 0
Compared effects of missense mutations in Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase deficiency: Combined analysis by structural, functional and pharmacological approaches. ||  || Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is an autosomal recessive disorder considered as one of the more common ss-oxidation defects, possibly associated with neonatal cardiomyopathy, infantile hepatic coma, or adult-onset myopathy. Numerous gene missense mutations have been described in these VLCADD phenotypes, but only few of them have been structurally and functionally analyzed, and the molecular basis of disease variability is still poorly understood. To address this question, we first analyzed fourteen disease-causing amino acid changes using the recently described crystal structure of VLCAD. The predicted effects varied from the replacement of amino acid residues lining the substrate binding cavity, involved in holoenzyme-FAD interactions or in enzyme dimerisation, predicted to have severe functional consequences, up to amino acid substitutions outside key enzyme domains or lying on near enzyme surface, with predicted milder consequences. These data were combined with functional analysis of residual fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and VLCAD protein levels in patient cells harboring these mutations, before and after pharmacological stimulation by bezafibrate. Mutations identified as detrimental to the protein structure in the 3-D model were generally associated to profound FAO and VLCAD protein deficiencies in the patient cells, however, some mutations affecting FAD binding or monomer-monomer interactions allowed a partial response to bezafibrate. On the other hand, bezafibrate restored near-normal FAO rates in some mutations predicted to have milder consequences on enzyme structure. Overall, combination of structural, biochemical, and pharmacological analysis allowed assessment of the relative severity of individual mutations, with possible applications for disease management and therapeutic approach.	1
Early-onset of symptoms and clinical course of Pompe disease associated with the c.-32-13 T > G variant. || C.-32–13 T > G Enzyme replacement therapy Glycogen storage disease type II IVS variant Late-onset Pompe disease Pompe disease Six minute walk test || Individuals with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and the common c.-32-13 T > G variant are widely thought to have milder, adult-onset disease. This belief, and the consequent low suspicion of clinical involvement in children, has led to delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation in patients with early onset of symptoms. Previous reports of LOPD in children do not include description of the early-onset phenotype. This description of signs and symptoms, some of which are subtle and less known, is important to facilitate prompt identification and appropriate treatment in symptomatic children. Retrospective chart review of a cohort of 84 LOPD patients with the c.-32-13 T > G variant was conducted to identify patients diagnosed clinically (as opposed to through newborn screening) who had clinically documented symptom-onset within the first two years of life. Four patients had early onset of symptoms, with age at onset ranging from 10 days to 20 months. Initial symptoms included delay in achievement of gross motor milestones, signs of proximal muscle weakness, swallow and feeding difficulties, and sleep apnea. Early and characteristic alterations in posture and movement were identified in all patients. Age at diagnosis ranged from 10 months to 26 months. Median age at enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) initiation was 23.5 months. Despite ERT, progression of musculoskeletal involvement and residual muscle weakness was evident in all patients, as evidenced by ptosis, myopathic facies, scoliosis, lumbar lordosis, scapular winging, and trunk and lower extremity weakness. Standardized functional assessments showed gross motor function below age level as measured by the Alberta Infant Motor Scales, the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, and the six-minute walk test. Onset of symptoms including delay in achievement of gross motor milestones, signs of proximal muscle weakness, swallow and feeding difficulties, and sleep apnea in the first two years of life is not uncommon in individuals with LOPD and the c.-32-13 T > G variant. Patients with early-onset disease appear to have a more, rapid and severe progression of disease with persistent residual muscle deficits which partially improve with higher doses of ERT. Careful evaluation for specific and characteristic patterns of posture and movement in patients with this variant is necessary to identify those who have early onset of disease. Increased awareness of the early-onset signs and symptoms may also enable early identification of disease onset in children who are diagnosed through newborn screening.	1 3
Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Type 2 Diabetes in the Old Order Amish. ||  || Alleles associated with lower levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) have recently been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), highlighting the complex relationship between LDL-C and diabetes. This observation begs the question of whether LDL-C-raising alleles are associated with a decreased risk of T2D. This issue was recently addressed in a large familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) screening study, which reported a lower prevalence of self-reported diabetes in FH subjects than in age-matched relatives without FH. To extend this observation, we tested the association of FH with diabetes status and glycemia in a large Amish population enriched for the FH-associated <i>APOB</i> R3527Q variant that included 640 <i>APOB</i> R3527Q carriers and 4,683 noncarriers. Each copy of the R3527Q T allele was associated with a 74.9 mg/dL increase in LDL-C. There was little difference in T2D prevalence between subjects with (5.2%) and without (4.5%) the R3527Q allele (<i>P</i> = 0.23), and there was no association between R3527Q variant and impaired fasting glucose, fasting glucose or insulin, or oral glucose tolerance test-derived measures. Our data provide no evidence supporting an association between the <i>APOB</i> R3527Q variant and T2D or glycemia and highlight the asymmetry of the LDL-C-T2D relationship and/or the gene/variant-dependent specificity of the LDL-C-T2D association.	4
Genomic characterization of two deletions in the LDLR gene in Tunisian patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia (ADH) is due to defects in the LDL receptor gene (LDLR), the apolipoprotein B-100 gene (APOB) or the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene (PCSK9). The aim of this study was to identify and to characterize the ADH-causative mutations in two Tunisian families. Analysis of the LDLR gene was performed by direct sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and by long range PCR and sequencing. The PCSK9 gene was analysed by direct sequencing and the APOB gene was screened for the most common mutation: p.Arg3527Gln. In the LDLR gene, we found two large deletions and characterized their exact extent and breakpoint sequences. The first one is a deletion of 12,684 bp linking intron 1 to intron 5: g.11205052_11217736del12684. The second deletion spans 2364 bp from intron 4 to 6: g.11216885_11219249del2364. Sequence analysis of each deletion breakpoint indicates that intrachromatid non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between Alu elements is involved. These two large rearrangements in the LDLR gene are the first to be described in the Tunisian population, increasing the spectrum of ADH-causative mutations.	4
Molecular genetics of familial hypercholesterolemia in Israel-revisited. || Familial hypercholesterolemia Hyperlipidemia LDL receptor LDLR mutation || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the genes for LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type9 (PCSK9). The purpose of the current investigation was to define the current spectrum of mutations causing FH in Israel. New families were collected through the MEDPED (Make Early Diagnosis Prevent Early Death) FH program. Molecular analysis of the LDLR, PCSK9 and APOB genes was done using High Resolution Melt and direct sequencing in 67 index cases. A 6-SNP LDL-C gene score calculation for polygenic hypercholesterolaemia was done using TaqMan genotyping. Mean serum cholesterol was 7.48 ± 1.89 mmol/L and the mean serum LDL-C was 5.99 ± 1.89 mmol/L. Mutations in the LDLR and APOB gene were found in 24 cases (35.8%), with 16 in LDLR, none in PCSK9 and one, p.(R3527Q), in the APOB gene, which is the first APOB mutation carrier identified in the Israeli population. Of the LDLR mutations, two were novel; p.(E140A) and a promoter variant, c.-191C > A. The c.2479G > A p.(V827I) in exon 17 of the LDLR gene was found in 8 patients (33.3% of the mutations) with modestly elevated LDL-C, but also in a compound heterozygous patient with a clinical homozygous FH phenotype, consistent with this being a "mild" FH-causing variant. A significantly higher 6-SNP LDL-C score was found in mutation-negative cases compared with a normal Caucasian cohort (p = 0.03), confirming that polygenic inheritance of common LDL-C raising SNPs can produce an FH phenocopy. The results indicate a different spectrum of genetic causes of FH from that found previously, in concordance with the heterogeneous and changing origins of the Israeli population, and confirm that a polygenic cause is also contributing to the FH phenotype in Israel.	4
Analysis of sequence variations in low-density lipoprotein receptor gene among Malaysian patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder mainly caused by defects in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. Few and limited analyses of familial hypercholesterolemia have been performed in Malaysia, and the underlying mutations therefore remain largely unknown.We studied a group of 154 unrelated FH patients from a northern area of Malaysia (Kelantan). The promoter region and exons 2-15 of the LDLR gene were screened by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to detect short deletions and nucleotide substitutions, and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect large rearrangements. A total of 29 gene sequence variants were reported in 117(76.0%) of the studied subjects. Eight different mutations (1 large rearrangement, 1 short deletion, 5 missense mutations, and 1 splice site mutation), and 21 variants. Eight gene sequence variants were reported for the first time and they were noticed in familial hypercholesterolemic patients, but not in controls (p.Asp100Asp, p.Asp139His, p.Arg471Gly, c.1705+117 T>G, c.1186+41T>A, 1705+112C>G, Dup exon 12 and p.Trp666ProfsX45). The incidence of the p.Arg471Gly variant was 11%. Patients with pathogenic mutations were younger, had significantly higher incidences of cardiovascular disease, xanthomas, and family history of hyperlipidemia, together with significantly higher total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein levels than patients with non-pathogenic variants. Twenty-nine gene sequence variants occurred among FH patients; those with predicted pathogenicity were associated with higher incidences of cardiovascular diseases, tendon xanthomas, and higher total and low density lipoprotein levels compared to the rest. These results provide preliminary information on the mutation spectrum of this gene among patients with FH in Malaysia.	4
Cytoplasmic localization of PML particles in laminopathies. ||  || There is growing evidence that laminopathies, diseases associated with mutations in the LMNA gene, are caused by a combination of mechanical and gene regulatory distortions. Strikingly, there is a large variability in disease symptoms between individual patients carrying an identical LMNA mutation. This is why classical genetic screens for mutations appear to have limited predictive value for disease development. Recently, the widespread occurrence of repetitive nuclear ruptures has been described in fibroblast cultures from various laminopathy patients. Since this phenomenon was strongly correlated with disease severity, the identification of biomarkers that report on these rupture events could have diagnostic relevance. One such candidate marker is the PML nuclear body, a structure that is normally confined to the nuclear interior, but leaks out of the nucleus upon nuclear rupture. Here, we show that a variety of laminopathies shows the presence of these cytoplasmic PML particles (PML CPs), and that the amount of these protein aggregates increases with severity of the disease. In addition, between clinically healthy individuals, carrying LMNA mutations, significant differences can be found. Therefore, we postulate that detection of PML CPs in patient fibroblasts could become a valuable marker for diagnosis of disease development.	0
[Genetic analysis and prenatal diagnosis for non-syndromic hearing impairment]. ||  || To detect genetic mutations underlying non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI) and establish a method for prenatal diagnosis. Sixty six NSHI patients were included in this study. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. Genetic mutations were detected by gene chip analysis and direct sequencing of GJB2 gene. For 7 pregnant women at high risk, prenatal genetic diagnosis was provided. Fourteen cases (21.21%) were found to have GJB2 mutations by both methods (homozygous 235delC mutation in 3 cases, homozygous 176del16 mutation in 2 cases, 235delC and 299delAT compound heterozygous mutation in 2 cases, 299delAT and 176del16 compound heterozygous mutation in 1 case, c.339T > G and 313del12bp compound heterozygous mutation 1 case, and 235delC heterozygous mutation in 5 cases). 13 (19.70%) had SLC26A4 mutations (IVS7-2 A >G homozygous mutation in 2 cases, IVS7-2 A > G homozygous mutation in 2 cases, IVS7-2 A > G and 2168A > G compound heterozygous mutation in 3 cases, 2168A>G heterozygous mutation in 3 cases, and IVS7-2 heterozygous mutation in 3 cases); and 3 had mtDNA12S rRNA mutation (1555A > G mutation in 2 cases, 1494C > T mutation in 1 case). Prenatal diagnosis suggested that 3 fetuses have carried a heterozygous mutation. Two fetuses were detected as normal and confirmed to have normal hearing after birth. Two fetuses were found to have carried compound mutations of GJB2. Gene chip combined with GJB2 gene analysis is an accurate and effective method for the diagnosis of NSHI. The results can facilitate accurate prenatal diagnosis.	1
HNF1B nephropathy has a slow-progressive phenotype in childhood-with the exception of very early onset cases: results of the German Multicenter HNF1B Childhood Registry. || Cystic kidney disease GFR decline HNF1B Hypomagnesemia MODY || HNF1B gene mutations are an important cause of bilateral (cystic) dysplasia in children, complicated by chronic renal insufficiency. The clinical variability, the absence of genotype-phenotype correlations, and limited long-term data render counseling of affected families difficult. Longitudinal data of 62 children probands with genetically proven HNF1B nephropathy was obtained in a multicenter approach. Genetic family cascade screening was performed in 30/62 cases. Eighty-seven percent of patients had bilateral dysplasia, 74% visible bilateral, and 16% unilateral renal cysts at the end of observation. Cyst development was non-progressive in 72% with a mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss of - 0.33 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> per year (± 8.9). In patients with an increase in cyst number, the annual GFR reduction was - 2.8 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (± 13.2), in the total cohort - 1.0 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (±10.3). A subset of HNF1B patients differs from this group and develops end stage renal disease (ESRD) at very early ages < 2 years. Hyperuricemia (37%) was a frequent finding at young age (median 1 year), whereas hypomagnesemia (24%), elevated liver enzymes (21%), and hyperglycemia (8%) showed an increased incidence in the teenaged child. Genetic analysis revealed no genotype-phenotype correlations but a significant parent-of-origin effect with a preponderance of 81% of maternal inheritance in dominant cases. In most children, HNF1B nephropathy has a non-progressive course of cyst development and a slow-progressive course of kidney function. A subgroup of patients developed ESRD at very young age < 2 years requiring special medical attention. The parent-of-origin effect suggests an influence of epigenetic modifiers in HNF1B disease.	4
Identification of a common low density lipoprotein receptor mutation (C163Y) in the west of Scotland. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal codominant disorder characterised by high levels of LDL cholesterol and a high incidence of coronary artery disease. Our aims were to track the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene in individual families with phenotypic FH and to identify and characterise any mutations of the LDLR gene that may be common in the west of Scotland FH population using single strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP). Patient samples consisted of 80 heterozygous probands with FH, 200 subjects who were related to the probands, and a further 50 normal, unrelated control subjects. Tracking of the LDLR gene was accomplished by amplification of a 19 allele tetranucleotide microsatellite that is tightly linked to the LDLR gene locus. Primers specific for exon 4 of the LDLR gene were used to amplify genomic DNA and used for SSCP analysis. Any PCR products with different migration patterns as assessed by SSCP were then sequenced directly. In addition to identifying probands with a common mutation, family members were screened using a forced restriction site assay and analysed using microplate array diagonal gel electrophoresis (MADGE). Microsatellite D19S394 analysis was informative in 20 of 23 families studied. In these families there was no inconsistency with segregation of the FH phenotype with the LDLR locus. Of the FH probands, 15/80 had a mutant allele as assessed by SSCP using three pairs of primers covering the whole of exon 4 of the LDLR gene. Direct DNA sequencing showed that 7/15 of the probands had a C163Y mutation. Using a PCR induced restriction site assay for the enzyme RsaI and MADGE, it was determined that the C163Y mutation cosegregated with the FH phenotype in family members of the FH probands. This mutant allele was not present in any of the control subjects. Microsatellite analysis has proven useful in tracking the LDLR gene and could be used in conjunction with LDL cholesterol levels to diagnose FH, especially in children and young adults where phenotypic diagnosis can be difficult.	4
Molecular and functional characterization of familial chylomicronemia syndrome. || Familial chylomicronemia syndrome Lipoprotein Lipoprotein lipase deficiency Triglyceride || Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder leading to severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) due to mutations in lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-associated genes. Few data exist on the clinical features of the disorder or on comprehensive genetic approaches to uncover the causative genes and mutations. Eight patients diagnosed with familial hyperchylomicronemia with recessive inheritance were included in this study (two males and six females; median age of onset 23.0 years; mean triglyceride level 3446 mg/dl). We evaluated their clinical features, including coronary artery disease using coronary computed tomography, and performed targeted next-generation sequencing on a panel comprising 4813 genes associated with known clinical phenotypes. After standard filtering for allele frequency <1% and in silico annotation prediction, we used three types of variant filtering to identify causative mutations: homozygous mutations in known familial hyperchylomicronemia-associated genes, homozygous mutations with high damaging scores in novel genes, and deleterious mutations within 37 genes known to be associated with HTG. A total of 1810 variants out of the 73,389 identified with 94.3% mean coverage (×20) were rare and nonsynonymous. Among these, our schema detected four pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in the LPL gene (p.Ala248LeufsTer4, p.Arg270Cys, p.Ala361Thr, and p.Val227Gly), including one novel mutation and a variant of uncertain significance. Patients harboring LPL gene mutations showed no severe atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries, but recurrent pancreatitis with long-term exposure to HTG was observed. These results demonstrate that LPL gene plays a major role in extreme HTG associated with hyperchylomicronemia, although the condition may not cause severe atherosclerosis.	4
Novel Mutations in the GPIIb and GPIIIa Genes in Glanzmann Thrombasthenia. ||  || BACKGROUND: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an inherited autosomal recessive platelet disorder characterized by a complete or partial lack, or mutation, of the GPIIb/IIIa complex (integrin α(IIb)β(3)) on the thrombocytes' surface, leading to a severe bleeding syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Molecular genetic analysis was performed in patients with suspected GT. The aim of the present study was the identification of new natural variants, their impact on platelet function, and their relation to the risk of bleeding. RESULTS: Expression of the platelet integrin α(IIb)β(3) was determined by flow cytometry. Mutations were identified through sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA. In addition, platelet function studies (PAC-binding, aggregations) were implemented. The study included 25 patients revealing 13 mutations (GPIIb: n = 9; GPIIIa: n = 4). Two of the 13 mutations were previously described (T207I; L214P). The remaining mutations have not been published yet, whereas 1 mutation in 2 unrelated families was identical (3062 T→C). CONCLUSION: All patients with less than 25% of present α(IIb)β(3) have a medical history of bleeding.	1 3
Mutational analysis and genotype-phenotype relation in familial hypercholesterolemia: The SAFEHEART registry. || Atherogenic lipoprotein particles Defective variants Familial hypercholesterolemia Mutational analysis Null variants || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease of cholesterol metabolism that confers an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Therefore, early identification and treatment of these patients can improve prognosis and reduce the burden of cardiovascular mortality. The aim of this work was to perform the mutational analysis of the SAFEHEART (Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Cohort Study) registry. The study recruited 2938 individuals with genetic diagnosis of FH belonging to 775 families. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v23. A total of 194 variants have been detected in this study, 24 of them were never described before. About 88% of the patients have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Patients with null variants have a more severe phenotype than patients with defective variants, presenting with significantly higher levels of atherogenic particles (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B). This study shows the molecular characteristics of the FH patients included in the SAFEHEART registry and the relationship with the phenotypic expression. The majority of the genetic variants are considered to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic, which confers a high level of confidence to the entry and follow-up data analysis performed with this registry concerning FH patients' prognosis, treatment and survival.	4
Hyperphenylalaninemia in the Czech Republic: genotype-phenotype correlations and in silico analysis of novel missense mutations. ||  || Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders caused by deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). HPA is associated with mutations in the PAH gene, which leads to reduced protein stability and/or impaired catalytic function. Currently, almost 700 different disease-causing mutations have been described. The impact of mutations on enzyme activity varies ranging from classical PKU, mild PKU, to non-PKU HPA phenotype. We provide results of molecular genetic diagnostics of 665 Czech unrelated HPA patients, structural analysis of missense mutations associated with classical PKU and non-PKU HPA phenotype, and prediction of effects of 6 newly discovered HPA missense mutations using bioinformatic approaches and Molecular Dynamics simulations. Ninety-eight different types of mutations were indentified. Thirteen of these were novel (6 missense, 2 nonsense, 1 splicing, and 4 small gene rearrangements). Structural analysis revealed that classical PKU mutations are more non-conservative compared to non-PKU HPA mutations and that specific sequence and structural characteristics of a mutation might be critical when distinguishing between non-PKU HPA and classical PKU mutations. The greatest impact was predicted for the p.(Phe263Ser) mutation while other novel mutations p.(Asn167Tyr), p.(Thr200Asn), p.(Asp229Gly), p.(Leu358Phe), and p.(Ile406Met) were found to be less deleterious.	1
CNS-accessible Inhibitor of Glucosylceramide Synthase for Substrate Reduction Therapy of Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase and the consequent lysosomal accumulation of unmetabolized glycolipid substrates. Enzyme-replacement therapy adequately manages the visceral manifestations of nonneuronopathic type-1 Gaucher patients, but not the brain disease in neuronopathic types 2 and 3 GD. Substrate reduction therapy through inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) has also been shown to effectively treat the visceral disease. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a novel small molecule inhibitor of GCS with central nervous system (CNS) access (Genz-682452) to treat the brain disease. Treatment of the conduritol β epoxide-induced mouse model of neuronopathic GD with Genz-682452 reduced the accumulation of liver and brain glycolipids (>70% and >20% respectively), extent of gliosis, and severity of ataxia. In the genetic 4L;C* mouse model, Genz-682452 reduced the levels of substrate in the brain by >40%, the extent of gliosis, and paresis. Importantly, Genz-682452-treated 4L;C* mice also exhibited an ~30% increase in lifespan. Together, these data indicate that an orally available antagonist of GCS that has CNS access is effective at attenuating several of the neuropathologic and behavioral manifestations associated with mouse models of neuronopathic GD. Therefore, Genz-682452 holds promise as a potential therapeutic approach for patients with type-3 GD.	0
Analyses of variant acid beta-glucosidases: effects of Gaucher disease mutations. ||  || Acid beta-glucosidase (GCase) is a 497-amino acid, membrane-associated lysosomal exo-beta-glucosidase whose defective activity leads to the Gaucher disease phenotypes. To move toward a structure/function map for disease mutations, 52 selected single amino acid substitutions were introduced into GCase, expressed in an insect cell system, purified, and characterized for basic kinetic, stability, and activator response properties. The variant GCases from Gaucher disease patients and selected variant GCases from the mouse had decreased relative k(cat) and differential effects on active site binding and/or attachment of mechanism-based covalent (conduritol B epoxide) or reversible (deoxynojirimycin derivatives) inhibitors. A defect in negatively charged phospholipid activation was present in the majority of variant GCases but was increased in two, N370S and V394L. Deficits in saposin C enhancement of k(cat) were present in variant GCases involving residues 48-122, whereas approximately 2-fold increases were obtained with the L264I GCase. About 50% of variant GCases each had wild-type or increased sensitivity to in vitro cathepsin D digestion. Mapping of these properties onto the crystal structures of GCase indicated wide dispersion of functional properties that can affect catalytic function and stability. Site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine residues showed that the disulfide bonds, Cys(4)-Cys(16) and Cys(18)-Cys(23), and a free Cys(342) were essential for activity; the free Cys(126) and Cys(248) were not. Relative k(cat) was highly sensitive to a His substitution at Arg(496) but not at Arg(495). These studies and high phylogenetic conservation indicate localized and general structural effects of Gaucher disease mutations that were not obvious from the nature of the amino acid substitution, including those predicted to be nondisruptive (e.g. Val --> Leu). These results provide initial studies for the engineering of variant GCases and, potentially, molecular chaperones for therapeutic use.	0
Genetic mutations in patients with possible familial hypercholesterolaemia in South East Scotland. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is one of the most common genetic disorders in the general population. Genetic testing of this condition is increasingly available in the UK to confirm its diagnosis, but the strategies of genetic testing vary. In this pilot study, we sought to investigate whether a strategy that focuses on the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and apolipoprotein B (APOB) genes can identify the majority of genetic variants in patients with possible FH in South East Scotland. Forty patients with a clinical diagnosis of possible FH according to the Simon Broome criteria were recruited in a lipid clinic serving South East Scotland. All 18 exons of the LDLR gene were sequenced and multiplex ligation probe amplification was performed to identify major deletions and duplications. Variants of the APOB gene at codon 3527 were investigated by direct sequencing. Genetic mutations were detected in 45% of the patients. Sixteen patients (40%) were found to have mutations in their LDLR gene, whereas two other patients (5%) were identified as heterozygous for the APOB variant commonly associated with FH (c.10580G>A; p.R3527Q). None of these genetic variants were detected in more than two patients. Multiple genetic mutations are associated with a clinical phenotype of FH in South East Scotland. A genetic testing strategy which focuses on a limited number of mutations is unlikely to confirm the diagnosis of FH in the majority of patients in this part of Scotland.	4
IPF-1/MODY4 gene missense mutation in an Italian family with type 2 and gestational diabetes. ||  || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic autosomal-dominant form of diabetes mellitus with onset before 25 years of age. Genetic variation in insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF1) (MODY4) is uncommon but may contribute to early- or late-onset diabetes as part of a polygenic background. IPF1 is a homeodomain transcription factor required for pancreas development. Our aim was to identify whether IPF1 gene mutations play a role in Italian early-onset type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients and what functional impact mutations may have in the beta cell. We screened 40 Italian early-onset type 2 diabetic probands for IPF1 mutations, performed oral glucose tolerance tests in the unaffected family members, and performed in vitro functional studies of the mutant variant. In an extended family (Italy-6) of 46 members with clinical phenotypes of gestational diabetes, MODY, and T2D, a single nucleotide change of CCT to ACT was identified at codon 33 resulting in a Pro to Thr substitution (P33T) in the IPF1 transactivation domain that also contributes to an altered metabolic status in the unaffected NM subjects. Of the 22 genotyped Italy-6 members, 9 carried the P33T allele (NM), of whom 5 have either T2D or elevated fasting glucose levels. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed higher glucose levels at 90 minutes in unaffected NM compared with unaffected NN subjects. Of the 5 female pregnant carriers of the IPF1 mutation, 4 had pregnancies complicated by reduced birth weights, miscarriages, or early postnatal deaths. In studies in vitro, the IPF1 mutant protein (P33T) showed a reduction in DNA-binding and transcriptional activation functions as compared to the wild-type IPF1 protein. Our findings suggest that the P33T IPF1 mutation may provide an increased susceptibility to the development of gestational diabetes and MODY4 in the Italy-6 pedigree.	4 0
Identification of recurrent and novel mutations in the LDL receptor gene in German patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || In order to identify mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene in primary hypercholesterolemia, we screened 100 unrelated German individuals with elevated plasma LDL-C (LDL-C > 4,7 mmol/l) for mutations in the 18 exons and their flanking intronic sequences including the promoter region of the LDL-R gene using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing. In addition we tested all patients for the presence of mutations in codons 3456 - 3553 of the gene encoding apolipoprotein B-100. In 56 individuals we detected 37 different mutations affecting the LDL-R gene, 16 of which, designated C122R, C127Y, C163W, F179L, R236W, E296X, R553C, V618D, T721I, V785D, G1358+2A, 257delTCTGGAGGT, 657delC, 676insACGGTATGGACTGCAdelGACG, C1205delTCT, 2420delTCCTTCT, have not yet been reported. One proband was a compound heterozygote showing two separate sequence variations (E207X and T705I). Seven patients were heterozygous for the mutation R3500Q within the apoB-100 gene. These results demonstrate that there is a broad spectrum of mutations in the LDL-R gene and that the R3500Q mutation is a frequent cause of hypercholesterolemia in the German population.	4
A combination of genetic and biochemical analyses for the diagnosis of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway-associated megalencephaly. || AKT3 MCAP MPPH Multiplex targeted sequencing PIK3R2 PTEN Phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein || Constitutive activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (mTOR pathway) underlies megalencephaly in many patients. Yet, prevalence of the involvement of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in patients with megalencephaly remains to be elucidated, and molecular diagnosis is challenging. Here, we have successfully established a combination of genetic and biochemical methods for diagnosis of mTOR pathway-associated megalencephaly, and have attempted to delineate the clinical characteristics of the disorder. Thirteen patients with an increased head circumference and neurological symptoms participated in the study. To evaluate the activation of the mTOR pathway, we performed western blot analysis to determine the expression levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (phospho-S6 protein) in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 12 patients. Multiplex targeted sequencing analysis for 15 genes involved in the mTOR pathway was performed on 12 patients, and whole-exome sequencing was performed on one additional patient. Clinical features and MRI findings were also investigated. We identified pathogenic mutations in six (AKT3, 1 patient; PIK3R2, 2 patients; PTEN, 3 patients) of the 13 patients. Increased expression of phospho-S6 protein was demonstrated in all five mutation-positive patients in whom western blotting was performed, as well as in three mutation-negative patients. Developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features were observed in almost all patients. Syndactyly/polydactyly and capillary malformations were not observed, even in patients with AKT3 or PIK3R2 mutations. There were no common phenotypes or MRI findings among these patients. A combination of genetic and biochemical methods successfully identified mTOR pathway involvement in nine of 13 (approximately 70%) patients with megalencephaly, indicating a major contribution of the pathway to the pathogenesis of megalencephaly. Our combined approach could be useful to identify patients who are suitable for future clinical trials using an mTOR inhibitor.	4
Detection of Familial Hypercholesterolemia Using Next Generation Sequencing in Two Population-Based Cohorts. || High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II LDL Receptors mutation || We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in a subject with hypercholesterolaemia from two population-based cohorts in South Korea. A total of 283 subjects with total cholesterol levels of 290 mg/dL (7.5 mmol/L) or higher were selected from the Namwon and Dong-gu Studies. We used next generation sequencing (NGS) to detect mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) genes. We have confirmed 17 different mutations of the LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 in 23 subjects (8.1%). Eleven LDLR variants and one APOB variant have been previously reported. One LDLR and two PCSK9 rare variants were identified in the variants database, but not in the FH mutation database. Two novel LDLR variants were found, p.Leu680Val, and p.Thr734Phe. No LDLR, APOB or PCSK9 deletions nor insertions were found. When the subjects were restricted to 110 subjects with a total cholesterol ≥310 mg/dL, only 10 variants were found in the 10 subjects (9.1%). These results suggest that given the low prevalence of FH mutations in subjects with high total cholesterol levels, NGS-based testing for a population-based approach to FH detection may not be cost-effective.	4
Aortic valve calcium score in hypercholesterolemic patients with and without low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutation. ||  || The aim of this study was a comparison of aortic valve calcium score (AVCS) between patients with hypercholesterolemia and genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia with low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutation (LDLR-M group), versus patients with hypercholesterolemia without LDLR gene mutation (LDLR-WT group). A total of 72 LDLR-M patients and 50 LDLR-WT patients were enrolled in the study and underwent CT as a part of an assessment of coronary calcium scoring. AVCS was determined and compared between the two patient groups. AVCS was significantly higher in the LDLR-M group in comparison to the LDLR-WT group (13.8 ± 37.9 vs. 0.94 ± 3.1, p = 0.03). The Yates' chi-squared test for independence revealed that LDLR mutation and AVCS were significantly dependable (Chi^2 = 6.106, p = 0.013). The LDLR mutation was a strong predictor of a high AVCS (OR 7.83, 95% CI 2.08-29.50, p = 0.002) on multivariate regression analysis. Among the traditional risk factors, age (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.18, p<0.001) and SBP (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07, p = 0.045) were also significant for high result of AVCS. An assessment of computed tomography calcium scores showed that LDLR-M patients have increased AVCS in comparison to those with LDLR-WT. In addition, LDLR mutation can be considered as an independent risk factor of having high AVSC even after adjustment for risk factors including cholesterol levels. This may result from the associated process connected with the regulatory role of LDLR in evolution of aortic valve calcifications.	4
Identification of six new Gaucher disease mutations. ||  || The four most common mutations account for 97% of the Gaucher disease-producing alleles in Jewish patients and 75% of the alleles in non-Jewish patients. Although at least 15 other mutations and some examples of gene conversion and/or fusion genes have been described, a number of mutations remain unidentified. We have now identified six new mutations, a deletion of a C at the 72 position of the cDNA, a 481C-->T mutation (122Pro-->Ser), a 751T-->C (212Tyr-->His), a 1549G-->A (478Gly-->Ser), a 1604G-->A (496Arg-->His), and a 55-bp deletion. All but one of these were found in single families. The 1604A mutation, however, was observed in four unrelated individuals.	1 4
Spectrum of USH2A mutations in Scandinavian patients with Usher syndrome type II. ||  || Usher syndrome type II (USH2) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by moderate to severe high-frequency hearing impairment, normal balance function and progressive visual impairment due to retinitis pigmentosa. Usher syndrome type IIa, the most common subtype, is defined by mutations in the USH2A gene encoding a short and a recently discovered long usherin isoform comprising 21 and 73 exons, respectively. More than 120 different disease-causing mutations have been reported, however, most of the previous reports concern mutations restricted to exons 1-21 of the USH2A gene. To explore the spectrum of USH2A disease-causing mutations among Scandinavian USH2 cases, patients from 118 unrelated families of which 27 previously had been found to carry mutations in exons 1-21 were subjected to extensive DNA sequence analysis of the full size USH2A gene. Altogether, 122 USH2A DNA sequence alterations were identified of which 57 were predicted to be disease-causing, 7 were considered to be of uncertain pathogenicity and 58 were predicted to be benign variants. Of 36 novel pathogenic USH2A mutations 31 were located in exons 22-73, specific to the long isoform. USH2A mutations were identified in 89/118 (75.4%) families. In 79/89 (88.8%) of these families two pathogenic mutations were identified whereas in 10/89 (11.2%) families the second mutation remained unidentified. In 5/118 (4.2%) families the USH phenotype could be explained by mutations in the USH3A gene. The results presented here provide a comprehensive picture of the genetic aetiology of Usher syndrome type IIA in Scandinavia as it is known to date.	4
The E326K mutation and Gaucher disease: mutation or polymorphism? ||  || Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in the gene for human glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the intracellular hydrolysis of glucosylceramide. While over 150 different glucocerebrosidase mutations have been identified in patients with Gaucher disease, not all reported mutations have been fully characterized as being causative. One such mutation is the E326K mutation, which results from a G to A nucleotide substitution at genomic position 6195 and has been identified in patients with type 1, type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease. However, in each instance, the E326K mutation was found on the same allele with another glucocerebrosidase mutation. Utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening and restriction digestions of both patients with Gaucher disease and normal controls, we identified the E326K allele in both groups. Of the 310 alleles screened from patients with Gaucher disease, the E326K mutation was detected in four alleles (1.3%). In addition, screening for the E326K mutation among normal controls from a random population revealed that three alleles among 316 screened (0.9%) also carried the E326K mutation. In the normal controls with the E326K allele, the glucocerebrosidase gene was completely sequenced, but no additional mutations were found. Because the E326K mutation may be a polymorphism, we caution that a careful examination of any allele with this mutation should be performed to check for the presence of other glucocerebrosidase mutations.	1
Homomeric and heteromeric interactions between wild-type and mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase subunits: evaluation of two-hybrid approaches for functional analysis of mutations causing hyperphenylalaninemia. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH), while mutations in genes encoding the two enzymes (dihydropteridine reductase, DHPR, and pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, PCD) required for recycling of its cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), cause other rarer disease forms of hyperphenylalaninemia. We have applied a yeast two-hybrid method, in which protein--protein interactions are measured by four reporter gene constructs, to the analysis of six PKU-associated PAH missense mutations (F39L, K42I, L48S, I65T, A104D, and R157N). By studying homomeric interactions between mutant PAH subunits, we show that this system is capable of detecting quite subtle aberrations in PAH oligomerization caused by missense mutations and that the observed results generally correlate with the severity of the mutation as determined by other expression systems. The mutant PAH subunits are also shown in this system to be able to interact with wild-type PAH subunits, pointing to an explanation for apparent dominant negative effects previously observed in obligate heterozygotes for PKU mutations. Based on our findings, the applications and limitations of two-hybrid approaches in understanding mechanisms by which PAH missense mutations exert their pathogenic effects are discussed. We have also used this technique to demonstrate homomeric interactions between wild-type DHPR subunits and between wild-type PCD subunits. These data provide a basis for functional studies on HPA-associated mutations affecting these enzymes.	0
Somatic mosaicism of the PIK3CA gene identified in a Hungarian girl with macrodactyly and syndactyly. || Macrodactyly and syndactyly Overgrowth syndromes PIK3CA gene Phenotypic diversity Somatic mutation || Isolated macrodactyly (OMIM 155500) belongs to a heterogeneous group of overgrowth syndromes. It is a congenital anomaly resulting in enlargement of all tissues localized to the terminal portions of a limb and caused by somatic mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic alpha (PIK3CA, OMIM 171834) gene. Here we report a Hungarian girl with macrodactyly and syndactyly. Genetic screening at hotspots in the PIK3CA gene identified a mosaic mutation (c.1624G > A, p.Glu542Lys) in the affected tissue, but not in the peripheral blood. To date, this somatic mutation has been reported in eight patients affected by different forms of segmental overgrowth syndromes. Detailed analysis of the Hungarian child and previously reported cases suggests high phenotypic diversity associated with the p.Glu542Lys somatic mutation. The identification of the mutation provides a novel therapeutic modality for the affected patients: those who carry somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene are potential recipients of a novel "repurposing" approach of rapamycin treatment.	4
Spectrum of mutations in index patients with familial hypercholesterolemia in Singapore: Single center study. || APOB mutation Familial hypercholesterolemia LDL receptor LDLR mutation Low density lipoprotein cholesterol Next generation sequencing || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by the presence of high plasma low density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-c). Patients with FH, with mutation detected, are at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease compared to those without mutations. The aim of the study was to assess the type of mutations in patients, clinically diagnosed with FH in Singapore. Patients (probands) with untreated/highest on-treatment LDL-c>4.9 mmol/l were recruited (June 2015 to April 2017). Anthropometric, biochemical indices, blood and family history were collected. DNA was extracted and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed in 26 lipid-related genes, including LDLR, APOB and PCSK9, and validated using Sanger. Multiplex-ligation probe analyses for LDLR were performed to identify large mutation derangements. Based on HGVS nomenclature, LDLR mutations were classified as "Null"(nonsense, frameshift, large rearrangements) and "Defective"(point mutations which are pathogenic). Ninety-six probands were recruited: mean age: (33.5 ± 13.6) years. 52.1% (n = 50) of patients had LDLR mutations, with 15 novel mutations, and 4.2% (n = 4) had APOB mutations. Total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-c were significantly higher in those with LDLR mutations compared to APOB and no mutations [(8.53 ± 1.52) vs. (6.93 ± 0.47) vs. (7.80 ± 1.32)] mmol/l, p = 0.012 and [(6.74 ± 0.35) vs. (5.29 ± 0.76) vs. (5.98 ± 1.23)] mmol/l, p=0.005, respectively. Patients with "null LDLR" mutations (n = 13) had higher TC and LDL-c than "defective LDLR" mutations (n = 35): [(9.21 ± 1.60) vs. (8.33 ± 1.41)]mmol/l, p = 0.034 and [(7.43 ± 1.47) vs. (6.53 ± 1.21)]mmol/l, p=0.017, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mutation detection in patients with clinically suspected FH by NGS in Singapore. While percentage of mutations is similar to other countries, the spectrum locally differs.	4
Two new mild homozygous mutations in Gaucher disease patients: clinical signs and biochemical analyses. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from impaired activity of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase. More than 60 mutations have been described in the GBA gene. They have been classified as lethal, severe, and mild on the basis of the corresponding phenotype. The fact that most GD patients are compound heterozygous and that most type 1 patients bear the N370S allele, which by itself causes a mild phenotype, make it difficult to correlate the clinical signs with the mutations. Besides N370S, about 10 mild mutations have been described, but only one undoubtedly classified as mild was found at homozygosity. Here we report 2 novel mutations, I402T and V375L, at homozygosity in 2 adult Italian type 1 GD patients. Some properties of the I402T fibroblast enzyme have been compared to those of the enzyme from cells of several N370S/N370S patients. Analysis of the catalytic properties and heat stability as well as the response to phosphatidylserine and sphingolipid activator protein indicate a marked similarity between the 2 enzymes. The finding of another, unrelated patient bearing the I402T mutation (in this case as a compound heterozygote with mutation N370S) suggests that this allele might be quite frequent in the area of Sicily from where both patients originated. In conclusion, the phenotypic expression in the 2 homozygous patients presented here and the biochemical data for one of them allowed the classification of these mutations as mild thus extending the group of mild mutations found at homozygosity.	1 4 3
Dyslipemia in familial partial lipodystrophy caused by an R482W mutation in the LMNA gene. ||  || Lipatrophic diabetes, also referred to as familial partial lipodystrophy, is a rare disease that is metabolically characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance. Affected patients typically present with regional loss of body fat and muscular hypertrophic appearance. Variable symptoms may comprise pancreatitis and/or eruptive xanthomas due to severe hypertriglyceridemia, acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovaria, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Mutations within the LMNA gene on chromosome 1q21.2 were recently reported to result in the phenotype of familial partial lipodystrophy. The genetic trait is autosomal dominant. We identified a family with partial lipodystrophy carrying the R482W (Arg(482)Trp) missense mutation within LMNA. Here we present the lipoprotein characteristics in this family in detail. Clinically, the loss of sc fat and muscular hypertrophy especially of the lower extremities started as early as in childhood. Acanthosis and severe hypertriglyceridemia developed later in life, followed by diabetes. The characterization of the lipoprotein subfractions revealed that affected children present with hyperlipidemia. The presence and severity of hyperlipidemia seem to be influenced by age, apolipoprotein E genotype, and the coexistence of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, dyslipemia is an early and prominent feature in the presented lipodystrophic family carrying the R482W mutation within LMNA.	4 2
Characterization of beta cell and incretin function in patients with MODY1 (HNF4A MODY) and MODY3 (HNF1A MODY) in a Swedish patient collection. ||  || The aim of this study was to evaluate the beta cell and incretin function in patients with HNF4A and HNF1A MODY during a test meal. Clinical characteristics and biochemical data (glucose, proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1 and GIP) during a test meal were compared between MODY patients from eight different families. BMI-matched T2D and healthy subjects were used as two separate control groups. The early phase of insulin secretion was attenuated in HNF4A, HNF1A MODY and T2D (AUC0-30 controls: 558.2 ± 101.2, HNF4A MODY: 93.8 ± 57.0, HNF1A MODY: 170.2 ± 64.5, T2D: 211.2 ± 65.3, P < 0.01). Markedly reduced levels of proinsulin were found in HNF4A MODY compared to T2D and that tended to be so also in HNF1A MODY (HNF4A MODY: 3.7 ± 1.2, HNF1A MODY: 8.3 ± 3.8 vs. T2D: 26.6 ± 14.3). Patients with HNF4A MODY had similar total GLP-1 and GIP responses as controls (GLP-1 AUC: (control: 823.9 ± 703.8, T2D: 556.4 ± 698.2, HNF4A MODY: 1,257.0 ± 999.3, HNF1A MODY: 697.1 ± 818.4) but with a different secretion pattern. The AUC insulin during the test meal was strongly correlated with the GIP secretion (Correlation coefficient 1.0, P < 0.001). No such correlation was seen for insulin and GLP-1. Patients with HNF4A and HNF1A MODY showed an attenuated early phase of insulin secretion similar to T2Ds. AUC insulin during the test meal was strongly correlated with GIP secretion, whereas no such correlation was seen for insulin and GLP-1. Thus, GIP may be a more important factor for insulin secretion than GLP-1 in MODY patients.	4
Incidence of infantile Pompe disease in the Maroon population of French Guiana. || genetics metabolic || The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of infantile Pompe disease (IPD) in French Guiana, a French overseas territory, by combining a retrospective case records study and a prospective anonymous genotyping in a sample of mothers followed in the two major maternity units of French Guiana. We identified 19 newborns with IPD born within a 13-year-period in French Guiana, corresponding to 1/4528 births. All children were born within the African-American Maroon (Bushinengue) community originating from slaves who settled along the Maroni river in the 19th century. We also performed an anonymised screening for all women in postpartum, in the two main maternity units of French Guiana. Genetic investigations revealed that all patients with IPD were homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for two known pathogenic variations: c.2560C>T p.(Arg854*) that has already been reported in African-Americans and c.1942G>A p.(Gly648Ser), a rare previously considered to be variant. We identified no heterozygotes among 453 mothers of various ethnicities in Cayenne, but 15 heterozygotes among 425 mothers (1/27) in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni (95% CI 1/45 to 1/17), all from the Maroon community, which corresponds to an expected IPD incidence in Maroons of 1/1727 (95% CI 1/1156 to 1/8100). The incidence of IPD in the Maroon community is roughly 50 times higher than elsewhere in the world. The presence of only two different variants in all affected patients is compatible with a double founder effect in a relatively small population that has seldom mixed with other regional populations in the past and therefore has a reduced pool of genotypes.	1
Impaired nuclear functions lead to increased senescence and inefficient differentiation in human myoblasts with a dominant p.R545C mutation in the LMNA gene. ||  || We have studied myoblasts from a patient with a severe autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (AD-EDMD) caused by an arginine 545 to cystein point mutation (p.R545C) in the carboxy-terminal domain of the lamin A/C gene. This mutation has pleiotropic cellular effects on these myoblasts as demonstrated by nuclear structural defects, exhibiting lobulations which increase with cell passages in culture. The organization of both lamin A/C and its inner nuclear membrane partner emerin are altered, eventually showing a honeycomb pattern upon immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, the distribution of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 and of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, markers of inactive and active chromatin domains, respectively, are altered suggesting an impact on gene expression. Patient myoblasts also presented a high index of senescence in ex vivo culture. Moreover, our data show for the first time in an AD-EDMD context that the 20S core particle of the proteasome was inactivated. With cell passages, the 20S core protein progressively accumulated into discrete nuclear foci that largely colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies while p21 accumulated throughout the nuclear compartment. Proteasome inactivation has been linked to normal cellular ageing. Our data indicate that it may also contribute to premature senescence in AD-EDMD patient myoblasts. Finally, when transferred to low-serum medium, patient myoblasts were deficient in ex vivo differentiation, as assessed by the absence of myotube formation and myogenin induction. Altogether, these data suggest that the LMNA mutation p.R545C impairs both proliferation and differentiation capacities of myoblasts as part of the pathogenesis of AD-EDMD.	4 0
A missense mutation at codon 188 of the human lipoprotein lipase gene is a frequent cause of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in persons of different ancestries. ||  || Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism by hydrolysing the core triglycerides of circulating chylomicrons and VLDL. Human, bovine, mouse, and guinea pig complementary DNA clones have recently been isolated and the organization of the human LPL gene is now known to comprise 10 exons spanning approximately 30 kb. Here we report a similar mutation on 21 alleles from 13 unrelated affected probands with LPL deficiency of French Canadian, English, Polish, German, Dutch, and East Indian ancestry. We show that an identical missense mutation within exon 5, resulting in an amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for glycine at position 188, is responsible for LPL deficiency in 21 of 88 LPL alleles assessed. This mutation alters an Ava II restriction site in exon 5 and will allow a rapid screening test for this mutation in patients with LPL deficiency. This mutation has occurred on the same haplotype in all the unrelated affected persons suggesting a common origin. The amino acid substitution lies within the longest segment of homology for LPL in different species and results in a protein that is catalytically defective.	4
Novel presentations of congenital hyperinsulinism due to mutations in the MODY genes: HNF1A and HNF4A. ||  || Inactivating mutations in HNF1A and HNF4A cause the maturity-onset diabetes of youth (MODY)-3 and MODY1 forms of monogenic diabetes, respectively. Children carrying HNF4A (MODY1) mutations can present in early infancy with macrosomia and diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism. Our objective was to describe three novel cases of hyperinsulinism associated with MODY1 and MODY3 mutations. Clinical data were obtained from chart review. Gene sequencing was performed on genomic DNA. Case 1 was diagnosed at 20 months with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and was found to have a novel MODY3 HNF1A mutation, carried by her father who had diabetes. Case 2 was diagnosed with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism at 3 months of age and had complete resolution of hyperinsulinism by 4 yr. She was found to have a novel MODY3 HNF1A missense mutation, also carried by her father. Case 3 presented as a newborn with diazoxide-responsive hyperinsulinism and later developed renal Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemic rickets, and hepatic glycogenosis. Although the latter's features suggested Fanconi-Bickel syndrome, sequencing of the SLC2A2 gene was normal. The patient was found to have a known MODY1 mutation in HNF4A. In all cases, the hyperinsulinism improved with age. The first two cases demonstrate that mutations in HNF1A (MODY3) can cause hyperinsulinism early in life and diabetes later, similar to the phenotype recently reported for HNF4A (MODY1) mutations. Case 3 indicates that the effects of HNF4A mutations in infancy may extend beyond pancreatic β-cells to produce a disorder similar to glucose transporter 2 deficiency involving both liver glycogen metabolism and renal tubular transport.	4
A missense mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene causes familial hypercholesterolemia in Sephardic Jews. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Here, we characterize an LDL receptor mutation that is associated with a distinct haplotype and that causes FH in the Jewish Sephardic population originating from Safed, a town in northern Israel. The mutation was found in eight FH families originating from this community comprising 10% of heterozygote FH index cases screened in Israel. The mutation was not found in four additional FH heterozygotes whose hypercholesterolemia co-segregated with an identical LDL receptor gene haplotype. A guanine to cytosine substitution results in a missense mutation (asp147 to his) in the fourth repeat of the binding domain encoded by exon 4 of the LDL receptor gene. The mutant receptor protein was synthesized in cultured cells as a 120 kDa precursor form that failed to undergo normal processing to a mature cell surface form. Most of the receptor precursors were degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum. The small number of mutant receptors on the cell surface were unable to bind LDL or beta very low density lipoprotein. The abnormal behavior of the mutant receptor was reproduced by site-directed mutagenesis and expression of the mutant protein in CHO cells. The mutation can be diagnosed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA from FH patients.	0
Molecular Genetics and Genotype-Based Estimation of BH4-Responsiveness in Serbian PKU Patients: Spotlight on Phenotypic Implications of p.L48S. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Here, we report the updated spectrum of PAH mutations in 61 Serbian PKU patients. By using both DGGE/DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP, we identified 26 disease-causing mutations (detection rate 99%). The most frequent ones were p.L48S (31%), p.R408W (16.4%), p.P281L (6%), p.E390G (5.2%), and p.I306V (5.2%). Homozygosity value indicated high heterogeneity of Serbian population.To overcome possible pitfalls of patients' phenotypic classification, we used two parameters: pretreatment/maximal phenylalanine blood concentration and Phe tolerance. The two phenotypes did not match only for patients with p.L48S. Therefore, we used Mann-Whitney statistical test to compare pretreatment/maximal blood Phe concentration and Phe tolerance detected in patients with p.[L48S];[null] and p.[missense];[null] genotypes. For patients with p.L48S, our results implied that Phe tolerance is a better parameter for phenotypic classification. Also, Fisher's exact test was used to compare p.L48S effect on phenotype of homozygous and functionally hemizygous patients. Our findings showed that effect of p.L48S was altered in functional hemizygotes. Moreover, phenotypic inconsistency found in homozygotes suggested that interallelic complementation and/or additional factors play a role in genotype-phenotype correlation.Since BH4-supplementation therapy is not available in Serbia, we made the first estimation of its potential benefit based on patients' genotypes. In the analyzed cohort, the total frequency of BH4-responsive mutations was 52.6%. Furthermore, we found a significant number of genotypes (26.2% BH4-responsive and 51% probably BH4-responsive) that may respond to BH4 therapy. This led us to a conclusion that BH4-supplementation therapy could bring benefit to Serbian PKU patients.	2
Association of MTOR Mutations With Developmental Brain Disorders, Including Megalencephaly, Focal Cortical Dysplasia, and Pigmentary Mosaicism. ||  || Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), hemimegalencephaly, and megalencephaly constitute a spectrum of malformations of cortical development with shared neuropathologic features. These disorders are associated with significant childhood morbidity and mortality. To identify the underlying molecular cause of FCD, hemimegalencephaly, and diffuse megalencephaly. Patients with FCD, hemimegalencephaly, or megalencephaly (mean age, 11.7 years; range, 2-32 years) were recruited from Pediatric Hospital A. Meyer, the University of Hong Kong, and Seattle Children's Research Institute from June 2012 to June 2014. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 8 children with FCD or hemimegalencephaly using standard-depth (50-60X) sequencing in peripheral samples (blood, saliva, or skin) from the affected child and their parents and deep (150-180X) sequencing in affected brain tissue. Targeted sequencing and WES were used to screen 93 children with molecularly unexplained diffuse or focal brain overgrowth. Histopathologic and functional assays of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT (serine/threonine kinase)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activity in resected brain tissue and cultured neurons were performed to validate mutations. Whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing identified variants associated with this spectrum of developmental brain disorders. Low-level mosaic mutations of MTOR were identified in brain tissue in 4 children with FCD type 2a with alternative allele fractions ranging from 0.012 to 0.086. Intermediate-level mosaic mutation of MTOR (p.Thr1977Ile) was also identified in 3 unrelated children with diffuse megalencephaly and pigmentary mosaicism in skin. Finally, a constitutional de novo mutation of MTOR (p.Glu1799Lys) was identified in 3 unrelated children with diffuse megalencephaly and intellectual disability. Molecular and functional analysis in 2 children with FCD2a from whom multiple affected brain tissue samples were available revealed a mutation gradient with an epicenter in the most epileptogenic area. When expressed in cultured neurons, all MTOR mutations identified here drive constitutive activation of mTOR complex 1 and enlarged neuronal size. In this study, mutations of MTOR were associated with a spectrum of brain overgrowth phenotypes extending from FCD type 2a to diffuse megalencephaly, distinguished by different mutations and levels of mosaicism. These mutations may be sufficient to cause cellular hypertrophy in cultured neurons and may provide a demonstration of the pattern of mosaicism in brain and substantiate the link between mosaic mutations of MTOR and pigmentary mosaicism in skin.	4 0
The p.R482W substitution in A-type lamins deregulates SREBP1 activity in Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy. ||  || Nuclear lamins are involved in many cellular functions due to their ability to bind numerous partners including chromatin and transcription factors, and affect their properties. Dunnigan type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2; OMIM#151660) is caused in most cases by the A-type lamin R482W mutation. We report here that the R482W mutation affects the regulatory activity of sterol response element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a transcription factor that regulates hundreds of genes involved in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. Using in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA), reporter assays and biochemical and transcriptomic approaches, we show that interactions of SREBP1 with lamin A and lamin C occur at the nuclear periphery and in the nucleoplasm. These interactions involve the Ig-fold of A-type lamins and are favored upon SREBP1 binding to its DNA target sequences. We show that SREBP1, LMNA and sterol response DNA elements form ternary complexes in vitro. In addition, overexpression of A-type lamins reduces transcriptional activity of SREBP1. In contrast, both overexpression of LMNA R482W in primary human preadipocytes and endogenous expression of A-type lamins R482W in FPLD2 patient fibroblasts, reduce A-type lamins-SREBP1 in situ interactions and upregulate a large number of SREBP1 target genes. As this LMNA mutant was previously shown to inhibit adipogenic differentiation, we propose that deregulation of SREBP1 by mutated A-type lamins constitutes one underlying mechanism of the physiopathology of FPLD2. Our data suggest that SREBP1 targeting molecules could be considered in a therapeutic context.	0
Evaluation of a clinically applicable mutation screening technique for genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia and familial defective apolipoprotein B. ||  || We have recently developed a simple mutation screening assay based on the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique for detection of mutations in the coding and regulatory regions of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene and the codon 3500 region of the apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 gene leading to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial defective apo B-100 (FDB), respectively. To evaluate the assay, 14 Danish families suspected of FH were studied. In ten families, the DGGE assay detected seven different point mutations, including mutations undescribed prior to establishing the assay. In addition, in one of these ten families and in one of the remaining four families, Southern blotting detected the FH-DK3 exon 5 deletion. Based on segregation analysis and clinical data, the FH diagnosis was dubious in the remaining three families without DGGE or Southern blotting detectable mutations. In conclusion, a simple DGGE based mutation screening assay may detect underlying mutations in most FH/FDB families, thus allowing its routine use in genetic counselling of FH-families.	4
High prevalence of CDH23 mutations in patients with congenital high-frequency sporadic or recessively inherited hearing loss. ||  || Mutations in CDH23 are responsible for Usher syndrome 1D and recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. In this study, we revealed the prevalence of CDH23 mutations among patients with specific clinical characteristics. After excluding patients with GJB2 mutations and mitochondrial m.1555A > G and m.3243A > G mutations, subjects for CDH23 mutation analysis were selected according to the following criteria: 1) Sporadic or recessively inherited hearing loss 2) bilateral non-syndromic congenital hearing loss, 3) no cochlear malformation, 4) a poorer hearing level at high frequencies than at low frequencies, and 5) severe or profound hearing loss at higher frequencies. Seventy-two subjects were selected from 621 consecutive probands who did not have environmental causes for their hearing loss. After direct sequencing, 13 of the 72 probands (18.1%) had homozygous or compound heterozygous CDH23 mutations. In total, we identified 16 CDH23 mutations, including five novel mutations. The 16 mutations included 12 missense, two frameshift, and two splice-site mutations. These results revealed that CDH23 mutations are highly prevalent in patients with congenital high-frequency sporadic or recessively inherited hearing loss and that the mutation spectrum was diverse, indicating that patients with these clinical features merit genetic analysis.	1
[Detection of the frequencies of GBA gene major mutations in patients with Gaucher disease in Ukraine]. ||  || The molecular diagnostics of 27 from 26 Ukrainian families has been performed. The common mutations in GBA gene (N370S, L444P and 84GG) accounted for up to 58% of all cases: mutation N370S was detected in 42.3% alleles, mutation L444P was observed in 15.4% alleles and mutation 84GG was not found at all. The other mutations were: P178S, W184R and Rec Nci I (in compounds with N370S) in the patients with nonneuronopathic form of Gaucher disease, and the genotypes G377S/c 999G --> A and D409H/R120W/G202R were detected in patients with chronic neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease. The data analysis of the genotype and disease progression in the patients allows confirming the known genotype-phenotype correlation.	1 4
Gaucher disease ascertained through a Parkinson's center: imaging and clinical characterization. ||  || Among the genes implicated for parkinsonism is glucocerebrosidase (GBA), which causes Gaucher disease (GD). Despite a growing literature that GD may present as parkinsonism, neuroimaging, olfaction, and neuropsychological testing have not been extensively reported. We describe transcranial sonography (TCS), 18F-fluorodopa (F-dopa) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron emission tomography, olfaction testing, neuropsychological testing, and clinical features in homozygous and compound heterozygous GBA mutation carriers identified through screening of 250 Ashkenazi Jewish parkinsonian individuals treated at a tertiary care center. We identified two individuals with N370S/R496H compound heterozygous mutations and two with N370S homozygous mutations; one individual died before completing detailed evaluation. TCS (n = 3) demonstrated nigral hyperechogenicity that was greater than controls [median area maximal substantia nigra echogenicity (aSNmax) = 0.28 cm(2) vs. 0.14 cm(2), P = 0.005], but similar to idiopathic PD (aSNmax = 0.31 cm(2)). FDG PET (n = 2) demonstrated hypermetabolism of the lentiform nuclei, and F-fluorodopa PET (n = 2), bilateral reduction in striatal F-dopa uptake. Olfaction was markedly impaired in the two tested cases, including onset of smell disturbance in adolescence in one. Neuropsychological features (n = 3) were consistent with Parkinson's disease (PD) or diffuse Lewy body disease (DLB). The imaging, neuropsychological and olfactory markers suggest the GD phenotype includes PD with and without features of DLB, marked olfactory loss, nigral hyperechogenicity on TCS, and F-dopa and FDG PET abnormalities.	1 4 3
Brain white matter microstructural alterations in children of type I Gaucher disease characterized with diffusion tensor MR imaging. || Children Diffusion tensor imaging Gaucher disease White matter || To investigate white matter (WM) microstructural alterations in type I Gaucher disease (type I GD) pediatric patients and explore the correlation between the disease duration and WM changes. Twenty-two GD patients and twenty-two sex- and age-matched typical development (TD) children were recruited. Changes in WM were investigated using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and applying atlas-based tract analysis. For all DTI measurements, independent-samples t-test was applied to report significant differences between type I GD and TD. Partial correlation was applied to determine whether the disease duration was correlated with DTI measurements. Bidirectional fractional anisotropy (FA) changes were found in the bilateral superior cerebellar peduncle, right posterior limb of the internal capsule, right posterior corona radiata, and right posterior thalamic radiation (p < 0.05). Higher mean diffusivity (MD)was found in the right superior corona radiata, middle cerebellar peduncle, right posterior thalamic radiation and right superior longitudinal fasciculus (p < 0.05) in type I GD. And higher radial diffusivity (RD) was also found in the left superior cerebellar peduncle (p < 0.05) in type I GD. The disease duration of type I GD patients is positively correlated with axial diffusivity and MD in multiple major WM tracts. DTI findings supported the microstructural alterations of multiple WM tracts in type I GD patients.	1 4
External ear anomalies and hearing impairment in Noonan Syndrome. || Dysmorphic ear anomalies Genotype–phenotype correlation Hearing impairment Noonan Syndrome || This is the first cohort in which hearing impairment and external ear anomalies in Noonan Syndrome are described extensively. Retrospective analysis of the otorhinolaryngological and clinical genetic data from 97 Noonan Syndrome (NS) patients. Forty-four NS patients were seen by an otorhinolaryngologist for the analysis of hearing impairment. In our cohort 80 of the 97 patients were genetically tested. In 71 of these mutations were found: in 48 patients a mutation in PTPN11, in 10 patients in SOS1, in 5 patients in SHOC2, in 5 patients in RAF1, in 1 patient in MAP2K2, in 1 patient in KRAS and in 1 patient in A2ML1. External ear anomalies were reported in 75 NS patients (77%). In 69 patients the ears were low-set, 28 patients had posteriorly rotated ears, 14 patients showed protruding ears and 18 had thickened helices. Hearing impairment was detected in 34 NS patients. Nine patients had sensorineural hearing impairment, two a permanent conductive hearing impairment, two other patients had mixed hearing impairment and 20 patients had conductive hearing impairment in the past, caused by otitis media with effusion. Their temporary conductive hearing impairment resolved between the ages of 2 and 18 years. Sensorineural hearing impairment varied between mild high-frequency hearing impairment and profound (uni- and bilateral) hearing impairment and was progressive in three patients. Four NS patients received cochlear implants for their severe sensorineural hearing impairment. The cohort is small for genotype-phenotype correlations, but sensorineural hearing impairment, especially the bilateral severe hearing impairment, was only seen in patients with a PTPN11 mutation. NS is characterized by dysmorphic external ear anomalies and both sensorineural and conductive hearing impairment. Audiological examinations are recommended in all patients with Noonan Syndrome.	4
Molecular Diagnosis of Mosaic Overgrowth Syndromes Using a Custom-Designed Next-Generation Sequencing Panel. ||  || Recent studies have discovered a group of overgrowth syndromes, such as congenital lipomatous overgrowth with vascular, epidermal, and skeletal anomalies (CLOVES) syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and megalencephaly-capillary malformation-polymicrogyria (MCAP) syndrome, are caused by somatic activating variants in genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway. Because of the low-abundance nature of these variants, Sanger sequencing often yields negative results. We have developed and validated a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel that targets all known variants associated with these syndromes. Fifty cases, including two prenatal cases, were tested using the panel. A pathogenic variant in the PIK3CA, PIK3R2, or AKT1 gene was identified in 28 of the 50 cases with the variant allele frequencies ranging from 1.0% to 49.2%. These variants were only present in the affected tissues in most of the cases, demonstrating a causal role in the development of these diseases. In vitro cell culture showed significant enrichment of the cells harboring variant alleles, suggesting that these variants render growth advantages to mutant cells. Phenotype-genotype correlation analysis showed PIK3CA mutation hotspots at residues E542, E545, and H1047 are often associated with CLOVES syndrome, whereas PIK3CA G914R is preferentially related to MCAP. We thus demonstrate that NGS technology is highly sensitive for detecting low-level mosaicism and can facilitate clinical diagnosis of mosaic overgrowth syndromes in both prenatal and postnatal settings.	4
Evidence-based tailoring of bioinformatics approaches to optimize methods that predict the effects of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in glucokinase. ||  || Computational methods that allow predicting the effects of nonsynonymous substitutions are an integral part of exome studies. Here, we validated and improved their specificity by performing a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis combined with experimental and clinical data on a model of glucokinase (GCK): 8835 putative variations, including 515 disease-associated variations from 1596 families with diagnoses of monogenic diabetes (GCK-MODY) or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), and 126 variations with available or newly reported (19 variations) data on enzyme kinetics. We also proved that high frequency of disease-associated variations found in patients is closely related to their evolutionary conservation. The default set prediction methods predicted correctly the effects of only a part of the GCK-MODY-associated variations and completely failed to predict the normoglycemic or PHHI-associated variations. Therefore, we calculated evidence-based thresholds that improved significantly the specificity of predictions (≤75%). The combined prediction analysis even allowed to distinguish activating from inactivating variations and identified a group of putatively highly pathogenic variations (EVmutation score <-7.5 and SNAP2 score >70), which were surprisingly underrepresented among MODY patients and thus under negative selection during molecular evolution. We suggested and validated the first robust evidence-based thresholds, which allow improved, highly specific predictions of disease-associated GCK variations.	0
Diagnostic exome sequencing in early-onset Parkinson's disease confirms VPS13C as a rare cause of autosomal-recessive Parkinson's disease. || Parkinson disease VPS13C exome genetic testing || Parkinson's disease (PD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and new putative disease genes are discovered constantly. Therefore, whole-exome sequencing could be an efficient approach to genetic testing in PD. To evaluate its performance in early-onset sporadic PD, we performed diagnostic exome sequencing in 80 individuals with manifestation of PD symptoms at age 40 or earlier and a negative family history of PD. Variants in validated and candidate disease genes and risk factors for PD and atypical Parkinson syndromes were annotated, followed by further analysis for selected variants. We detected pathogenic variants in Mendelian genes in 6.25% of cases and high-impact risk factor variants in GBA in 5% of cases, resulting in overall maximum diagnostic yield of 11.25%. One individual was compound heterozygous for variants affecting canonical splice sites in VPS13C, confirming the causal role of protein-truncating variants in this gene linked to autosomal-recessive early-onset PD. Despite the low diagnostic yield of exome sequencing in sporadic early-onset PD, the confirmation of the recently discovered VPS13C gene highlights its advantage over using predefined gene panels.	4
Clinical and molecular characteristics of patients with Gaucher disease in Southern China. || Expression study GBA gene Gaucher disease Molecular analysis || Gaucher disease (GD) is a common lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of acid β-glucosidase, due to mutations in the GBA gene. To explore the clinical and molecular characteristics of GD patients from Southern China, GBA gene were analyzed by nest PCR and direct Sanger-sequencing. Novel missense mutations were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells by plasmid system for functional verification. Among the 22 GD patients, 19 patients were classified as type 1 and three as type 2. Over 60% of the type 1 patient had the onset before two years of age and about 42% of them died before three years of age. Six type 1 patients with L444P homozygous genotype, presented with early onset and severe hepatosplenomegaly. Four novel mutations Y22C, F109L, L149F and c.983_990delCCCACTGG were identified. The GBA activities in vitro of novel mutants Y22C, F109L and L149F were 20.2%, 6.9% and 6.5% of the wild-type, respectively. L444P mutation accounted for 47.7% of the mutant alleles. Our results revealed that type 1 GD tends to present with a severe phenotype among southern Chinese. L444P was the most prevalent mutation and L444P homozygous genotype was associated with severe type 1 GD. Three novel missense mutations identified were pathogenic.	1 4 0 3
Noonan syndrome: comparing mutation-positive with mutation-negative dutch patients. || Congenital heart defects Facial characteristics Noonan syndrome RAS-MAPK pathway RASopathies || Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, short stature and congenital heart defects. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous and shows clinical overlap with other RASopathies. These syndromes are caused by mutations in a variety of genes leading to dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway: PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1, RAF1, CBL, SHOC2, NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, HRAS, NF1 and SPRED1. In this study, we conduct a genotype-phenotype analysis of 33 patients with a clinical diagnosis of NS without a PTPN11 mutation. Mutation analysis of the genes involved in RASopathies was performed, except for NF1 and SPRED1. In 14 (42%) NS patients, a mutation was found, 7 (21%) had a mutation in SOS1, 3 (9%) in RAF1 and 1 (3%) in KRAS, MAP2K2, BRAF and SHOC2 each. The phenotype of these mutation-positive cases corresponded to that described in the literature. In the cases with a BRAF and MAP2K2 mutation, the diagnosis cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome was made. The patient with the SHOC2 mutation had features compatible with 'Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair'. Three major clinical features of NS - a typical face, short stature and a pulmonary valve stenosis - were less frequently present in the group without a mutation. Missense mutations in genes encoding proteins of the RAS-MAPK pathway cause NS. The 3 major clinical features of NS were less frequently present in the mutation-negative patients, which stresses the importance of the syndrome-specific symptoms of the face, heart and short stature in NS. However, all mutation-negative cases met the NS criteria, indicating that the involvement of novel genes is to be expected.	4 2
Characterization of Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia Caused by PCSK9 Gain of Function Mutations and Its Specific Treatment With Alirocumab, a PCSK9 Monoclonal Antibody. || PCSK9 protein alirocumab cardiovascular diseases clinical trial genetics human hypercholesterolemia || Patients with PCSK9 gene gain of function (GOF) mutations have a rare form of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. However, data examining their clinical characteristics and geographic distribution are lacking. Furthermore, no randomized treatment study in this population has been reported. We compiled clinical characteristics of PCSK9 GOF mutation carriers in a multinational retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study. We then performed a randomized placebo-phase, double-blind study of alirocumab 150 mg administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks to 13 patients representing 4 different PCSK9 GOF mutations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥70 mg/dL on their current lipid-lowering therapies at baseline. Observational study: among 164 patients, 16 different PCSK9 GOF mutations distributed throughout the gene were associated with varying severity of untreated LDL-C levels. Coronary artery disease was common (33%; average age of onset, 49.4 years), and untreated LDL-C concentrations were higher compared with matched carriers of mutations in the LDLR (n=2126) or apolipoprotein B (n=470) genes. Intervention study: in PCSK9 GOF mutation patients randomly assigned to receive alirocumab, mean percent reduction in LDL-C at 2 weeks was 62.5% (P<0.0001) from baseline, 53.7% compared with placebo-treated PCSK9 GOF mutation patients (P=0.0009; primary end point). After all subjects received 8 weeks of alirocumab treatment, LDL-C was reduced by 73% from baseline (P<0.0001). PCSK9 GOF mutation carriers have elevated LDL-C levels and are at high risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Alirocumab, a PCSK9 antibody, markedly lowers LDL-C levels and seems to be well tolerated in these patients. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique Identifier: NCT01604824.	4
Novel mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene of Indian patients with Gaucher disease. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common glycolipid storage disorder resulting from glucocerebrosidase deficiency due to mutations in the GBA gene. Study was performed in 33 unrelated patients with low β-glucosidase activity in leukocytes and/or fibroblasts. The exons and exon-intron boundaries of the GBA gene were bidirectionally sequenced using an automated sequencer. Mutations were confirmed in parents and were looked up in public databases, and in silico analysis was carried for novel mutations. We identified two novel missense mutations G289A (c.866G>C) and I466S (c.1397T>G) in exons 7 and 10, respectively, in two (6.06%) patients that destabilize the protein structure. L444P (c.1448T>C) was the most common mutation identified in 20/33 (60.60%) non-neuronopathic and 1/33 (3.03%) sub-acute neuronopathic form based on clinical presentation at the time of investigation. Other nine rare mutations were: R463C (c.1504C>T), R395C (c.1300C>T), R359Q (c.1193G>A), G355D (c.1181G>A), V352M (c.1171G>A) and S356F (c.1184C>T) found in each patient (18.18%). Compound heterozygous mutation L444P (c.1448T>C)/R496C (c.1603C>T) in exon 10/11 and L444P (c.1448T>C)/R329C (c.1102C>T) were observed in exon 10/8 in one each patient (6.06%). Two patients (6.06%) from Sri Lanka showed E326K (c.1093G>A) mutation in exon 8. We conclude that L444P is the most common mutant allele with exons 8 and 10 as the hot spot region of GBA gene observed in Indian GD patients.	1 4 3
Analysis of Children and Adolescents with Familial Hypercholesterolemia. || Genetics LDL receptor gene children familial hypercholesterolemia screening || To evaluate the effectiveness of criteria based on child-parent assessment in predicting familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)-causative mutations in unselected children with hypercholesterolemia. LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 genes were sequenced in 78 children and adolescents (mean age 8.4 ± 3.7 years) with clinically diagnosed FH. The presence of polygenic hypercholesterolemia was further evaluated by genotyping 6 low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-raising single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Thirty-nine children (50.0%) were found to carry LDLR mutant alleles but none with APOB or PCSK9 mutant alleles. Overall, 27 different LDLR mutations were identified, and 2 were novel. Children carrying mutations showed higher LDL-C (215.2 ± 52.7 mg/dL vs 181.0 ± 44.6 mg/dL, P <.001) and apolipoprotein B levels (131.6 ± 38.3 mg/dL vs 100.3 ± 30.0 mg/dL, P <.004), compared with noncarriers. A LDL-C of ~190 mg/dL was the optimal value to discriminate children with and without LDLR mutations. When different diagnostic criteria were compared, those proposed by the European Atherosclerosis Society showed a reasonable balance between sensitivity and specificity in the identification of LDLR mutations. In children without mutation, the FH phenotype was not caused by the aggregation of LDL-C raising single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In unselected children with hypercholesterolemia, LDL-C levels >190 mg/dL and a positive family history of hypercholesterolemia appeared to be the most reliable criteria for detecting FH. As 50% of children with suspected FH did not carry FH-causing mutations, genetic testing should be considered.	4
A common and two novel GBA mutations in Thai patients with Gaucher disease. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, leading to a deficiency of lysosomal β-glucosidase and accumulation of glycosphingolipids in macrophages. We studied five Thai families with GD (four with GD type 1 and one with GD type 2). Using long-template PCR, PCR using specific primers for the functional gene, direct sequencing of all coding regions of GBA and restriction enzyme digestions, all 10 mutant alleles were successfully identified. The common c.1448T>C (p.L483P or L444P) mutation was identified in 60% of mutant alleles. Of the two patients homozygous for the p.L483P (L444P) mutation, one died from hepatic failure at age 16 years and the other died from sepsis at age 12 years. This p.L483P (L444P) mutation was found in four different haplotypes, suggesting that it was a recurrent mutation, not caused by a founder effect. Two novel mutations, a missense (c.1204T>C, p.Y402H), and a termination codon mutation (c.1609T>C, p.X537A) were found. Studies to determine the molecular pathomechanism of the p.X537A mutation, the first of its kind in this gene, showed that it decreased the amount of protein being expressed and the enzymatic activity, while it was still correctly localized.	1 4 3
Clinical whole exome sequencing in severe hypertriglyceridemia. || Exome sequencing Familial hyperchylomicronemia Lipoprotein lipase deficiency Triglyceride || Little data exist regarding the clinical application of whole exome sequencing (WES) for the molecular diagnosis of severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). WES was performed for 28 probands exhibiting severe HTG (≥1000 mg/dl) without any transient causes. We evaluated recessive and dominant inheritance models in known monogenic HTG genes, followed by disease-network gene prioritization and copy number variation (CNV) analyses to identify causative variants and a novel genetic mechanism for severe HTG. We identified possible causative variants for severe HTG, including three novel variants, in nine probands (32%). In the recessive inheritance model, we identified two homozygous subjects with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency and one subject harboring compound heterozygous variants in both LPL and APOA5 genes (hyperchylomicronemia). In the dominant inheritance model, we identified probands harboring deleterious heterozygous variants in LPL, glucokinase regulatory protein, and solute carrier family 25 member 40 genes, possibly associated with this extreme HTG phenotype. However, gene prioritization and CNV analyses did not validate the novel genes associated with severe HTG. In 28 probands with severe HTG, we identified potential causative variants within nine genes associated with rare Mendelian dyslipidemias. Clinical WES may be feasible for such extreme cases, potentially leading to appropriate therapies.	4
An improved method on stimulated T-lymphocytes to functionally characterize novel and known LDLR mutations. ||  || The main causes of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are mutations in LDL receptor (LDLR) gene. Functional studies are necessary to demonstrate the LDLR function impairment caused by mutations and would be useful as a diagnostic tool if they allow discrimination between FH patients and controls. In order to identify the best method to detect LDLR activity, we compared continuous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphocytes and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocytes. In addition, we characterized both novel and known mutations in the LDLR gene. T-lymphocytes and EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes were obtained from peripheral blood of 24 FH patients and 24 control subjects. Functional assays were performed by incubation with fluorescent LDL followed by flow cytometry analysis. Residual LDLR activity was calculated normalizing fluorescence for the mean fluorescence of controls. With stimulated T-lymphocytes we obtained a better discrimination capacity between controls and FH patients compared with EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes as demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (the areas under the curve are 1.000 and 0.984 respectively; P < 0.0001 both). The characterization of LDLR activity through T-lymphocytes is more simple and faster than the use of EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes and allows a complete discrimination between controls and FH patients. Therefore the evaluation of residual LDLR activity could be helpful not only for mutation characterization but also for diagnostic purposes.	0
Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha gene mutations and diabetes in Norway. ||  || Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha gene cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), type 3. To estimate the prevalence of MODY3 in Norwegian diabetic pedigrees, we screened a total of 130 families for HNF-1 alpha mutations; 42 families with clinical MODY, 75 with suspected MODY, and 13 pedigrees with multiplex type 1 diabetes. Twenty-two families with clinical MODY, 15 families with suspected MODY, and one family with type 1 diabetes multiplex harbored HNF-1 alpha mutations. Thus, in about half of Norwegian families with clinical MODY, mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene could be detected. Eight of the 18 different mutations identified were novel (G47E, T196fsdelCCAA, IVS3-1G>A, S256T, A276D, S445fsdelAG, M522V, and S531T). Haplotypes were determined for recurrent mutations, indicating a founder effect in Norway for the hot-spot mutation P291fsinsC and possibly also for P112L and R131W. To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying MODY3, we investigated the functional properties of 13 HNF-1 alpha mutations. Two mutant HNF-1 alpha proteins (R171X, R263C) were unable to bind DNA and at least five mutants (R131W, R171X, P379fsdelCT, S445fsdelAG, and Q466X) showed defective nuclear translocation. Transcriptional activation was reduced for most of the MODY3-associated mutants. Accordingly, the functional studies of HNF-1 alpha mutants indicate that beta-cell dysfunction in MODY3 is caused by loss-of-function mechanisms like reduced DNA binding, impaired transcriptional activation, and defects in subcellular localization.	4 0
Patients with familial partial lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type due to a LMNA R482W mutation show muscular and cardiac abnormalities. ||  || Diseases due to mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) are highly heterogeneous, including neuromuscular and cardiac dystrophies, lipodystrophies, and premature ageing syndromes. In this study we characterized the neuromuscular and cardiac phenotypes of patients bearing the heterozygous LMNA R482W mutation, which is the most frequent genotype associated with the familial partial lipodystrophy of the Dunnigan type (FPLD). Fourteen patients from two unrelated families, including 10 affected subjects, were studied. The two probands had been referred for lipoatrophy and/or diabetes. Lipodystrophy, exclusively observed in LMNA-mutated patients, was of variable severity and limited to postpubertal subjects. Lipodystrophy and metabolic disturbances were more severe in women, even if an enlarged neck was a constant finding. The severity of hypertriglyceridemia and hirsutism in females was related to that of insulin resistance. Clinical muscular alterations were only present in LMNA-mutated patients. Clinical and histological examination showed an invalidating, progressive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in a 42-yr-old woman that had been present since childhood, associated with a typical postpubertal FPLD phenotype. Six of eight adults presented the association of calf hypertrophy, perihumeral muscular atrophy, and a rolling gait due to proximal lower limb weakness. Muscular histology was compatible with muscular dystrophy in one of them and/or showed a nonspecific excess of lipid droplets (in three cases). Immunostaining of lamin A/C was normal in the six muscular biopsies. Surprisingly, calpain 3 expression was undetectable in the patient with the severe limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although the gene did not reveal any molecular alterations. At the cardiac level, cardiac septal hypertrophy and atherosclerosis were frequent in FPLD patients. In addition, a 24-yr-old FPLD patient had a symptomatic second degree atrioventricular block. In conclusion, we showed that most lipodystrophic patients affected by the FPLD-linked LMNA R482W mutation show muscular and cardiac abnormalities. The occurrence and severity of the myopathic and lipoatrophic phenotypes varied and were not related. The muscular phenotype was evocative of limb girdle muscular dystrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy and advanced atherosclerosis were frequent. FPLD patients should receive careful neuromuscular and cardiac examination whatever the underlying LMNA mutation.	4
Monocytes of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia show alterations in cholesterol metabolism. ||  || Elevated plasma cholesterol promotes the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in which monocyte-derived lipid-laden macrophages are frequently found. To analyze, if circulating monocytes already show increased lipid content and differences in lipoprotein metabolism, we compared monocytes from patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) with those from healthy individuals. Cholesterol and oxidized cholesterol metabolite serum levels of FH and of healthy, gender/age matched control subjects were measured by combined gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy. Monocytes from patients with FH and from healthy subjects were isolated by antibody-assisted density centrifugation. Gene expression profiles of isolated monocytes were measured using Affymetrix HG-U 133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. We compared monocyte gene expression profiles from FH patients with healthy controls using a Welch T-test with correction for multiple testing (p < 0.05; Benjamini Hochberg correction, False Discovery Rate = 0.05). The differential expression of FH associated genes was validated at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR and/or at the protein level by Western Blot or flow cytometry. Functional validation of monocyte scavenger receptor activities were done by binding assays and dose/time dependent uptake analysis using native and oxidized LDL. Using microarray analysis we found in FH patients a significant up-regulation of 1,617 genes and a down-regulation of 701 genes compared to monocytes from healthy individuals. These include genes of proteins that are involved in the uptake, biosynthesis, disposition, and cellular efflux of cholesterol. In addition, plasma from FH patients contains elevated amounts of sterols and oxysterols. An increased uptake of oxidized as well as of native LDL by FH monocytes combined with a down-regulation of NPC1 and ABCA1 explains the lipid accumulation observed in these cells. Our data demonstrate that circulating FH monocytes show differences in cell physiology that may contribute to the early onset of atherosclerosis in this disease.	0
Genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in a South European outbreed population: influence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene mutations on treatment response to simvastatin in total, LDL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. ||  || The aims of this study were to examine the presence of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene among subjects clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia and to analyze whether the molecular diagnosis helps to predict the response to simvastatin treatment in our familial hypercholesterolemia population. Fifty-five probands and 128 related subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia were studied. Genetic diagnosis was carried out following a three-step protocol based on Southern blot and PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. A randomized clinical trial with simvastatin was conducted in 42 genetically diagnosed subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia classified as carriers of null mutations (n = 22) and of defective mutations (n = 20). A mutation-causing familial hypercholesterolemia was identified in 46 probands (84%). In 41 of them (89%), a total of 28 point mutations were detected, 13 of which have not been previously described. The remaining five probands (11%) were carriers of large rearrangements. Familial hypercholesterolemia with null mutations showed a poor response to simvastatin treatment. The mean percentage reduction of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in these subjects were significantly lower (24.8 +/- 10.3 vs. 34.8 +/- 10.9, P = 0.04 and 30.0 +/- 39.8 vs. 46.1 +/- 18.2, P = 0.02, respectively) than in subjects with defective mutations. Baseline and posttreatment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma values were significantly lower in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia with null mutations (P < 0.001). In an outbreed Caucasian population, a three-step protocol for genetic screening detected a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in a high percentage (84%) of subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia. Subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia with null mutations (class I) showed lower plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values and a poor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to simvastatin treatment.	4
An investigation of serum concentration of apoM as a potential MODY3 marker using a novel ELISA. ||  || To investigate the fitness of serum apolipoprotein M (apoM) concentration as a marker for maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 (MODY3). This study consisted of two parts. A family study included 71 carriers of the P291fsinsC mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha) from the Finnish Botnia study, 53 of whom were diabetic, and 75 matched family controls. A second, case-control study included 24 MODY3 patients, 17 healthy MODY3 mutation carriers, 11 MODY1 patients, 18 type 2 diabetes patients and 19 healthy control individuals. Subjects in the case-control study were recruited from the Botnia study or the Clinic of Endocrinology, Malmö University Hospital. Serum apoM levels were measured using a novel ELISA based on two monoclonal apoM antibodies. In the family study, mean serum apoM was 10% lower in female carriers of the P291fsinsC mutation compared to the family controls (P = 0.0058), a difference which remained significant after adjustment for diabetes status. There was no observed difference between groups for men. In the case-control study, no significant difference in apoM concentration was observed between MODY3 and type 2 diabetes patients, neither before nor after adjustment for total cholesterol. Female carriers of the P291fsinsC mutation in HNF-1alpha displayed slightly lower apoM serum levels. This difference is too small for apoM to be reliably employed as a biomarker for HNF-1alpha mutation status.	4
A homozygous null mutation delineates the role of the melanocortin-4 receptor in humans. ||  || As a mediator of the effects of leptin, the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is an essential component of the central regulation of long-term energy homeostasis. Heterozygous mutations in this receptor are the most frequent genetic cause of severe obesity in children. The very rare described carriers of homozygous MC4R mutations for whom clinical data were available had a residual receptor activity thus not allowing for the description of the full extent of the role of MC4R in humans. Here, we present the clinical and biological features of a patient with complete absence of MC4R activity and compare the clinical and endocrine characteristics of this patient with those previously observed in leptin receptor-deficient patients. Our data suggest that in humans, the MC4R mediates most of the anorectic effects of leptin in early childhood. In contrast, MC4R does not mediate the effect of leptin on linear growth and other endocrine axes. In addition, complete MC4R deficiency is not a cause of relative hyperinsulinemia as recently observed in children with heterozygous MC4R mutations.	4 0 2
Multiple sources of metabolic disturbance in ETHE1-related ethylmalonic encephalopathy. ||  || Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by dysfunction of ETHE1, a mitochondrial dioxygenase involved in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detoxification. Patients present in infancy with psychomotor retardation, chronic diarrhea, orthostatic acrocyanosis and relapsing petechiae. High levels of lactic acid, ethymalonic acid (EMA) and methylsuccinic acid (MSA) are detected in body fluids. Several pathways may contribute to the pathophysiology, including isoleucine, methionine and fatty acid metabolism. We report on a 15-month-old male presenting with typical EE associated with a homozygous ETHE1 mutation. We investigated oral isoleucine (150 mg/kg), methionine (100 mg/kg), fatty acid loading tests and isoleucine-restricted diet (200 mg/day) for any effects on several metabolic parameters. Before loading tests or specific dietary interventions, EMA, C4-C5 acylcarnitines and most acylglycines were elevated, indicating functional deficiency of short chain acyl-CoA (SCAD) as well as all branched acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Excretion of EMA and n-butyrylglycine increased following each of the loads, and isoleucine led to increased levels of derivative metabolites. An isoleucine-restricted diet for 8 days corrected some of the abnormalities but led to no obvious clinical improvement and only partial effects on EMA. A principal component analysis supports the inference that these dietary conditions have consistent effects on the global metabolic profile. Our results suggest that multiple pathways modulate EMA levels in EE. They might all interact with H2S toxicity. Prolonged dietary interventions involving the restriction for branched aminoacids, fatty acids and methionine could be discussed as auxiliary therapeutical strategies in EE.	1
Gaucher disease with communicating hydrocephalus and cardiac involvement. ||  || A 14-year-old female with Gaucher disease presented with hydrocephalus, corneal opacities, cirrhosis, and cardiac valvular involvement. A homozygous D409H mutation was identified. She underwent surgery for aortic and mitral valve replacement. Because of severe calcification of the aortic root, no successful valve replacement was performed. She died on the third day after the explorative cardiac surgery. Cardiac abnormalities represent a life-threatening presentation of the homozygous D409H mutation. Identification of this type is essential prior to initiating appropriate therapy with enzyme replacement and cardiac corrective surgery.	1 4
Preliminary spectrum of genetic variants in familial hypercholesterolemia in Argentina. || APOB Argentina Cardiovascular disease Cardiovascular disease prevention Cholesterol Familial hypercholesterolemia Genetic variants LDLR gene Mutations Public health || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and early cardiovascular disease. As cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in Argentina, early identification of patients with FH is of great public health importance. The aim of our study was to identify families with FH and to approximate to the characterization of the genetic spectrum mutations of FH in Argentina. Thirty-three not related index cases were selected with clinical diagnosis of FH. Genetic analysis was performed by sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and bioinformatics tools. Twenty genetic variants were identified among 24 cases (73%), 95% on the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. The only variant on APOB was the R3527Q. Four were novel variants: c.-135C>A, c.170A>C p.(Asp57Ala), c.684G>C p.(Glu228Asp), and c.1895A>T p.(Asn632Ile); the bioinformatics' analysis revealed clear destabilizing effects for 2 of them. The exon 14 presented the highest number of variants (32%). Four variants were observed in more than 1 case and the c.2043C>A p.(Cys681*) was carried by 18% of index cases. Two true homozygotes, 3 compound heterozygotes, and 1 double heterozygote were identified. This study characterizes for the first time in Argentina genetic variants associated with FH and suggest that the allelic heterogeneity of the FH in the country could have 1 relative common low-density lipoprotein receptor mutation. This knowledge is important for the genotype-phenotype correlation and for optimizing both cholesterol-lowering therapies and mutational analysis protocols. In addition, these data contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of FH in Argentina.	4
GBA mutations in Gaucher type I Venezuelan patients: ethnic origins and frequencies. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD), the most frequent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by heterogeneous mutations in the locus coding for glucocerebrosidase (GBA). It is an autosomal recessive disorder with different phenotypes of which the most frequent is the nonneuronopathic or type 1, prevalent worldwide. To date, more than 430 mutations have been described, but their frequency distribution varies in different populations with four, N370S, L444P, IVS2 + 1G > A and 84insG, being the most frequent ones. In Venezuela, 20 unrelated index cases with GD type I were assessed for GBA mutation detection and for their in-phase haplotype identification, to gather genetic epidemiological data on the disease in the country and of its eventual ethnic origin. Ten missense mutations and two complex alleles were identified. The most frequent were N370S (42.5%), L444P (20%), IVS2+1G > A (10%) and R48W (5%); mutations R120W, P245H, H311R, R496H, W36X and R433G which were carried by a single chromosome each one. Three geographical foci were identified, displaying mutation heterogeneity. N370S had multiple genetic origins, different from the Ashkenazi's; a single common remote ancestor for this mutation in the country was dismissed, according to the haplotype analysis. All mutations have a likely European Caucasoid descent.	1 4
High frequency of CRB1 mutations as cause of Early-Onset Retinal Dystrophies in the Spanish population. ||  || CRB1 mutations are reported as cause of severe congenital and early-onset retinal dystrophies (EORD) with different phenotypic manifestations, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and cone-rod dystrophies. Comprehensive mutational scanning of the whole gene has been only performed in few cohorts, mainly in LCA patients. Here, we aimed investigating the real prevalence of CRB1 mutations in the Spanish population by extensive screening of CRB1 mutations in a large cohort of LCA and EORP cases. This report integrates data from previous studies on CRB1 defects in our Spanish cohort of LCA and early-onset RP (EORP) with new findings from a comprehensive mutational screening of the whole gene. The molecular tools used include mutation genotyping arrays, whole-genome homozygosity mapping, an optimized high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis and Sanger sequencing. A large clinically well-characterized cohort of 404 Spanish cases was studied, 114 of which suffered from LCA and 290 from EORP. This study reveals that 11% of Spanish patients carried mutations in CRB1, ranging from 9% of EORP to 14% of LCA cases. More than three quarters of the mutations identified herein have been first described in this Spanish cohort, 13 of them are unreported new variants and 13 had been previously reported in our previous studies. This work provides a wide spectrum of CRB1 mutations in the Spanish EORD patients and evidences the major role of CRB1 as causal gene in the Spanish EORP patients. It is noteworthy that a high rate of private mutations only described in our cohort has been found so far. To our knowledge, this study represents the most complete mutational screening of CRB1 in a Spanish LCA and EORP cohort, allowing us to establish gene-specific frequencies and to provide a wide spectrum of CRB1 mutations in the Spanish population.	0
Next-generation genetic testing for retinitis pigmentosa. ||  || Molecular diagnostics for patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) has been hampered by extreme genetic and clinical heterogeneity, with 52 causative genes known to date. Here, we developed a comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach for the clinical molecular diagnostics of RP. All known inherited retinal disease genes (n = 111) were captured and simultaneously analyzed using NGS in 100 RP patients without a molecular diagnosis. A systematic data analysis pipeline was developed and validated to prioritize and predict the pathogenicity of all genetic variants identified in each patient, which enabled us to reduce the number of potential pathogenic variants from approximately 1,200 to zero to nine per patient. Subsequent segregation analysis and in silico predictions of pathogenicity resulted in a molecular diagnosis in 36 RP patients, comprising 27 recessive, six dominant, and three X-linked cases. Intriguingly, De novo mutations were present in at least three out of 28 isolated cases with causative mutations. This study demonstrates the enormous potential and clinical utility of NGS in molecular diagnosis of genetically heterogeneous diseases such as RP. De novo dominant mutations appear to play a significant role in patients with isolated RP, having major implications for genetic counselling.	4
Impaired motor cortex plasticity in patients with Noonan syndrome. || Developmental disorder Long-term potentiation Paired associative stimulation (PAS) RAS-pathway Synaptic plasticity Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) || Noonan syndrome (NS; OMIM 163950) is a developmental disorder caused by activating mutations in various components of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated impairment of synaptic plasticity caused by RAS-MAPK pathway hyperactivity. Induction of synaptic plasticity critically depends on the level of attention. We therefore studied the induction of synaptic plasticity in patients with NS and healthy volunteers under different conditions of attention using transcranial magnetic stimulation. We investigated 10 patients with NS and healthy controls (HC) using paired associative stimulation (PAS) with different attention levels (unspecific, visual and electrical attention control). Changes in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were assessed immediately after as well as 30 and 60 min after PAS. We demonstrated that MEP amplitudes of healthy controls significantly increased from 1.00 ± 0.17 to 1.74 ± 0.50 mV (p=0.001), which was not seen in patients with Noonan-Syndrome (0.88 ± 0.09 to 1.10 ± 0.48 mV, p=0.148) and there was a significant difference between both groups (p=0.003) when using an unspecific attention control. Under specific electrical attention control, MEP amplitudes decreased significantly in patients with NS, whereas a visual attention focus diminished synaptic plasticity in healthy controls. Our study provides evidence that synaptic plasticity is impaired in patients with NS, which is probably a consequence of constitutive activity of the RAS-MAPK pathway. The induction of synaptic plasticity in these patients critically depends on attention. This is the first study that indicates reduced synaptic plasticity in patients with a RAS-pathway disorder. Our results may have direct implications for learning and memory strategies in patients with a RAS-pathway disorder.	4
Missense mutation in the USH2A gene: association with recessive retinitis pigmentosa without hearing loss. ||  || Microdeletions Glu767(1-bp del), Thr967(1-bp del), and Leu1446(2-bp del) in the human USH2A gene have been reported to cause Usher syndrome type II, a disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and mild-to-severe hearing loss. Each of these three frameshift mutations is predicted to lead to an unstable mRNA transcript that, if translated, would result in a truncated protein lacking the carboxy terminus. Here, we report Cys759Phe, a novel missense mutation in this gene that changes an amino-acid residue within the fifth laminin-epidermal growth factor-like domain of the USH2A gene and that is associated with recessive RP without hearing loss. This single mutation was found in 4.5% of 224 patients with recessive RP, suggesting that USH2A could cause more cases of nonsyndromic recessive RP than does any other gene identified to date.	2
Lower Circulating miR-122 Level in Patients with HNF1A Variant-Induced Diabetes Compared with Type 2 Diabetes. ||  || miR-122, the expression of which is regulated by several transcription factors, such as HNF1A, was recently reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma. HNF1A variants can cause diabetes and might be involved in the development of primary liver neoplasm. Differences in miR-122 expression among different types of diabetes have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate differences in serum miR-122 levels in Chinese patients with different forms of diabetes, including T2DM, type 1 diabetes (T1DM), HNF1A variant-induced diabetes (HNF1A-DM), glucokinase variant-induced diabetes (GCK-DM), and mitochondrial A3243G mutation-induced diabetes (MDM). In total, 12 HNF1A-DM patients, 24 gender-, age-, and body mass index-matched (1 : 2) T2DM patients and 24 healthy subjects were included in this study. In addition, 30 monogenic diabetes (11 GCK-DM and 19 MDM) and 17 T1DM patients were included. Fasted blood biochemistry and miR-122 were measured. The results showed that the HNF1A-DM patients had lower miR-122 levels [0.046 (0.023, 0.121)] than T2DM patients [0.165 (0.036, 0.939), <i>P</i> = 0.02] and healthy controls [0.249 (0.049, 1.234), <i>P</i> = 0.019]. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for miR-122 to discriminate HNF1A-DM and T2DM was 0.687 (95% CI: 0.52-0.86, <i>P</i> = 0.07). There was no difference in serum miR-122 among HNF1A-DM, GCK-DM, MDM, and T1DM patients. Lower serum miR-122 is a unique feature of HNF1A-DM patients and might partially explain the increased risk for liver neoplasm and abnormal lipid metabolism in HNF1A-DM patients.	4
Targeted next-generation sequencing reveals MODY in up to 6.5% of antibody-negative diabetes cases listed in the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry. || Antibody-negative Childhood-onset diabetes Genetic screening MODY Monogenic diabetes Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry Prevalence Sulfonylurea || MODY can be wrongly diagnosed as type 1 diabetes in children. We aimed to find the prevalence of MODY in a nationwide population-based registry of childhood diabetes. Using next-generation sequencing, we screened the HNF1A, HNF4A, HNF1B, GCK and INS genes in all 469 children (12.1%) negative for both GAD and IA-2 autoantibodies and 469 antibody-positive matched controls selected from the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry (3882 children). Variants were classified using clinical diagnostic criteria for pathogenicity ranging from class 1 (neutral) to class 5 (pathogenic). We identified 58 rare exonic and splice variants in cases and controls. Among antibody-negative patients, 6.5% had genetic variants of classes 3-5 (vs 2.4% in controls; p = 0.002). For the stricter classification (classes 4 and 5), the corresponding number was 4.1% (vs 0.2% in controls; p = 1.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). HNF1A showed the strongest enrichment of class 3-5 variants, with 3.9% among antibody-negative patients (vs 0.4% in controls; p = 0.0002). Antibody-negative carriers of variants in class 3 had a similar phenotype to those carrying variants in classes 4 and 5. This is the first study screening for MODY in all antibody-negative children in a nationwide population-based registry. Our results suggest that the prevalence of MODY in antibody-negative childhood diabetes may reach 6.5%. One-third of these MODY cases had not been recognised by clinicians. Since a precise diagnosis is important for treatment and genetic counselling, molecular screening of all antibody-negative children should be considered in routine diagnostics.	4
Missense mutation (Gly----Glu188) of human lipoprotein lipase imparting functional deficiency. ||  || Cloning and sequencing of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) cDNA prepared from the adipose tissue of a patient with classical LPL deficiency revealed a G to A transition at nucleotide 818 in all sequenced clones, leading to the substitution of glutamic acid for glycine at residue 188 of the mature protein. Hybridization of genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotides confirmed that the patient was homozygous for this mutation and revealed that carrier status for this mutation among relatives of the patient was significantly associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Assay of the patient's plasma for immunoreactive enzyme and activity demonstrated the presence of a circulating inactive enzyme protein, the concentration of which was further increased by injection of heparin. The mutant sequence was produced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, and both normal and mutant sequences were cloned into the expression vector pSVL and transfected into COS-1 cells. The normal sequence led to the in vitro expression of an enzyme that bound to heparin-Sepharose and had a specific catalytic activity similar to that of normal postheparin plasma enzyme. By contrast, the mutant enzyme expressed in vitro was catalytically inactive and displayed a lower affinity for heparin than the normal enzyme. We conclude that this single amino acid substitution leads to the in vivo expression of an inactive enzyme accounting for the manifestations of LPL deficiency noted in the patient.	4 0 2
Analysis of phenylalanine hydroxylase genotypes and hyperphenylalaninemia phenotypes using L-[1-13C]phenylalanine oxidation rates in vivo: a pilot study. ||  || Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) resulting from deficient activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is caused by mutations in the human PAH gene (McKusick 261600). Herein, we report a noninvasive method to: 1) estimate whole-body phenylalanine oxidation in patients with HPA and 2) compare effects of mutant genotypes on phenotypes. We used oral L-[1-13C]phenylalanine as a substrate and measured 13CO2 formation in the first hour as an index of phenylalanine oxidation rates in: 1) patients with PKU (n = 6), variant phenylketonuria (PKU) (n = 7) and non-PKU HPA (n = 4); 2) obligate heterozygotes (n = 18); and 3) controls (n = 8). PAH mutations were identified by PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing. Phenylalanine oxidation rates demonstrated a gene dosage effect; oxidation in heterozygotes was intermediate between probands and controls. The three classes of HPA had different mean oxidation rates (PKU < variant PKU < non-PKU HPA). The in vivo phenotype (HPA class or whole-body oxidation rate) did not always correspond to prediction from in vitro expression analysis of the mutation effect on enzyme activity. The findings indicate that the in vivo metrical trait (phenylalanine oxidation rate) is not a simple equivalent of phenylalanine hydroxylation activity (unit of protein phenotype) and, as expected, is an emergent property under the control of more than the PAH locus.	1 3
Cochlear implantation in individuals with Usher type 1 syndrome. ||  || To analyze the occurrence of the Usher type 1 (USH1) gene mutations in cochlear implant recipients with deaf-blind Usher syndrome, and to assess the potential effect of these genes and other factors on the therapeutic outcome. Case series study of nine patients with the phenotypic diagnosis of USH1. Mutation analysis of four USH1 genes (MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23, and PCDH15) by single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing methods. Pre- and post-implantation audiologic tests including pure tone audiometry, speech perception measures, and qualitative assessment of auditory performance. Nine USH1 patients who received their cochlear implants at the University of Miami Ear Institute, Miami, FL, USA, and at the Department of Cochlear Implants, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK. DNA samples from five of the nine patients were available for mutation analysis. Three of the five patients were found to carry USH1 mutations including two with a truncated mutation in CDH23 and one being a digenic inheritance with mutations in CDH23 and PCDH15. We may have failed to detect mutations in the amplicons analyzed, as neither SSCP nor direct sequencing, even combined, detects all mutations present. Our failure to detect mutations in all five patients may also confirm the genetic heterogeneity of USH1 and additional USH1 loci remain to be mapped. Pre-implantation assessment indicated that all of the subjects were pre-linguistically profoundly deaf, had no consistent response to sound, had varying degrees of auditory-oral habilitation. Age at implantation ranged from 2 to 11 years. There was post-implantation improvement in sound detection and speech recognition measures in closed-set format in all patients. Children implanted at an age of 3 years or less showed good open-set speech perception with lip-reading. All patients are implant users. Those patients who do not show open-set perception still use the cochlear implant as an adjunct of lip-reading or total communication. Testing for mutations in the USH1 genes allows early identification and intervention of children with USH1; timely intervention is important to maximize the development of useful auditory-oral communication skills prior to the onset of the visual impairment.	1
High Diagnostic Yield of Whole Exome Sequencing in Participants With Retinal Dystrophies in a Clinical Ophthalmology Setting. ||  || To assess the diagnostic yield and the practicality of implementing whole exome sequencing within a clinical ophthalmology setting. Evaluation of a diagnostic protocol. setting: Patient participants were enrolled during clinical appointments in a university-based ophthalmic genetics clinic. Twenty-six patients with a variety of presumed hereditary retinal dystrophies. Participants were offered whole exome sequencing in addition to clinically available sequencing gene panels between July 2012 and January 2013 to determine the molecular etiology of their retinal dystrophy. Diagnostic yield and acceptability of whole exome sequencing in patients with retinal disorders. Twenty-six of 29 eligible patients (∼90%) who were approached opted to undergo molecular testing. Each participant chose whole exome sequencing in addition to, or in lieu of, clinically available sequencing gene panels. Time to obtain informed consent was manageable in the clinical context. Whole exome sequencing successfully identified known pathogenic mutations or suspected deleterious variants in 57.7% of participants. Additionally, 1 participant had 2 autosomal dominant medically actionable incidental findings (unrelated to retinopathy) that were reported to enable the participant to take preventive action and reduce risk for future disease. In this study, we identified the molecular etiology for more than half of all participants. Additionally, we found that participants were widely accepting of whole exome sequencing and the possibility of being informed about medically actionable incidental findings.	4
Clinical application of ACMG-AMP guidelines in HNF1A and GCK variants in a cohort of MODY families. || ACMG GCK HNF1A MODY || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of monogenic diabetes with autosomal dominant inheritance. GCK -MODY and HNF1A -MODY are the prevalent subtypes. Currently, there is growing concern regarding the correct interpretation of molecular genetic findings. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) updated guidelines to interpret and classify molecular variants. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MODY ( GCK / HNF1A ) in a large cohort of Brazilian families, to report variants related to phenotype, and to classify them according to ACMG guidelines. One hundred and nine probands were investigated, 45% with clinical suspicion of GCK -MODY and 55% with suspicion of HNF1A -MODY. Twenty-five different variants were identified in GCK gene (30 probands-61% of positivity), and 7 variants in HNF1A (10 probands-17% of positivity). Fourteen of them were novel (12- GCK /2- HNF1A ). ACMG guidelines were able to classify a large portion of variants as pathogenic (36%- GCK /86%- HNF1A ) and likely pathogenic (44%- GCK /14%- HNF1A ), with 16% (5/32) as uncertain significance. This allows us to determine the pathogenicity classification more efficiently, and also reinforces the suspected associations with the phenotype among novel variants.	4 2
The role of the interactome in the maintenance of deleterious variability in human populations. || exome sequencing interactome mutational load network analysis robustness || Recent genomic projects have revealed the existence of an unexpectedly large amount of deleterious variability in the human genome. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain such an apparently high mutational load. However, the mechanisms by which deleterious mutations in some genes cause a pathological effect but are apparently innocuous in other genes remain largely unknown. This study searched for deleterious variants in the 1,000 genomes populations, as well as in a newly sequenced population of 252 healthy Spanish individuals. In addition, variants causative of monogenic diseases and somatic variants from 41 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients were analysed. The deleterious variants found were analysed in the context of the interactome to understand the role of network topology in the maintenance of the observed mutational load. Our results suggest that one of the mechanisms whereby the effect of these deleterious variants on the phenotype is suppressed could be related to the configuration of the protein interaction network. Most of the deleterious variants observed in healthy individuals are concentrated in peripheral regions of the interactome, in combinations that preserve their connectivity, and have a marginal effect on interactome integrity. On the contrary, likely pathogenic cancer somatic deleterious variants tend to occur in internal regions of the interactome, often with associated structural consequences. Finally, variants causative of monogenic diseases seem to occupy an intermediate position. Our observations suggest that the real pathological potential of a variant might be more a systems property rather than an intrinsic property of individual proteins.	4
Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH): a phenotypic comparison. ||  || Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) is a rare disorder, due to complete loss of function of an adaptor protein (ARH protein) required for receptor-mediated hepatic uptake of LDL. ARH is a phenocopy of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) due to mutations in LDL receptor (LDLR) gene; however, previous studies suggested that ARH phenotype is less severe than that of HoFH. To test this hypothesis we compared 42 HoFH and 42 ARH patients. LDLR and ARH genes were analysed by Southern blotting and sequencing. LDLR activity was measured in cultured fibroblasts. In ARH plasma LDL cholestrol (LDL-C) level (14.25+/-2.29 mmol/L) was lower than in receptor-negative HoFH (21.38+/-3.56 mmol/L) but similar to that found in receptor-defective HoFH (15.52+/-2.39 mmol/L). The risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) was 9-fold lower in ARH patients. No ARH patients </=20 years of age were found to have CAD as opposed to 43% of HoFH. The CAD prevalence was or tended to be lower in ARH also in the 21-40 (45% versus 86%) and 41-60 (78% versus 100%) age groups. Heterozygous ARH carriers showed higher level of LDL-C (+17%) than non-carrier family members. In conclusion the clinical phenotype of ARH is milder than that of receptor-negative HoFH and resembles that observed in receptor-defective HoFH.	4 0
Frequency of rare mutations and common genetic variations in severe hypertriglyceridemia in the general population of Spain. || Hypertriglyceridemia Mutations Prevalence || Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a common complex metabolic trait that results of the accumulation of relatively common genetic variants in combination with other modifier genes and environmental factors resulting in increased plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. The majority of severe primary hypertriglyceridemias is diagnosed in adulthood and their molecular bases have not been fully defined yet. The prevalence of HTG is highly variable among populations, possibly caused by differences in environmental factors and genetic background. However, the prevalence of very high TG and the frequency of rare mutations causing HTG in a whole non-selected population have not been previously studied. The total of 23,310 subjects over 18 years from a primary care-district in a middle-class area of Zaragoza (Spain) with TG >500 mg/dL were selected to establish HTG prevalence. Those affected of primary HTG were considered for further genetic analysis. The promoters, coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of LPL, LMF1, APOC2, APOA5, APOE and GPIHBP1 genes were sequenced. The frequency of rare variants identified was studied in 90 controls. One hundred ninety-four subjects (1.04%) had HTG and 90 subjects (46.4%) met the inclusion criteria for primary HTG. In this subgroup, nine patients (12.3%) were carriers of 7 rare variants in LPL, LMF1, APOA5, GPIHBP1 or APOE genes. Three of these mutations are described for the first time in this work. The presence of a rare pathogenic mutation did not confer a differential phenotype or a higher family history of HTG. The prevalence of rare mutations in candidate genes in subjects with primary HTG is low. The low frequency of rare mutations, the absence of a more severe phenotype or the dominant transmission of the HTG would not suggest the use of genetic analysis in the clinical practice in this population.	4
Clinical features and genetic analysis of three patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia. || ApoA-V apoC-II hypertriglyceridaemia lipoprotein lipase primary chylomicronaemia || Hypertriglyceridaemia is a common biochemical abnormality that can be due to primary causes or, more commonly, secondary causes. Moderate hypertriglyceridaemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and can develop into severe hypertriglyceridaemia which is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Familial chylomicronaemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, usually diagnosed in childhood and is characterized by marked hypertriglyceridaemia and biochemical deficiency of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein (apo) C-II, homozygous (or compound heterozygous) gene mutations in LPL or more rarely, APOC2. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the APOA5 gene have been reported in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia in whom LPL or APOC2 mutations were not found. We describe the clinical features and genetic analysis of three patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia including novel mutations LPL c.464T>C (p.Leu155Pro) and APOA5 c.823C>T (p.Gln275*).	4
Diagnostic Yield and Clinical Utility of Sequencing Familial Hypercholesterolemia Genes in Patients With Severe Hypercholesterolemia. || coronary artery disease gene sequencing genetics low-density lipoprotein cholesterol || Approximately 7% of American adults have severe hypercholesterolemia (untreated low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl), which may be due to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Lifelong LDL cholesterol elevations in FH mutation carriers may confer coronary artery disease (CAD) risk beyond that captured by a single LDL cholesterol measurement. This study assessed the prevalence of an FH mutation among those with severe hypercholesterolemia and determined whether CAD risk varies according to mutation status beyond the observed LDL cholesterol level. Three genes causative for FH (LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9) were sequenced in 26,025 participants from 7 case-control studies (5,540 CAD case subjects, 8,577 CAD-free control subjects) and 5 prospective cohort studies (11,908 participants). FH mutations included loss-of-function variants in LDLR, missense mutations in LDLR predicted to be damaging, and variants linked to FH in ClinVar, a clinical genetics database. Among 20,485 CAD-free control and prospective cohort participants, 1,386 (6.7%) had LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl; of these, only 24 (1.7%) carried an FH mutation. Within any stratum of observed LDL cholesterol, risk of CAD was higher among FH mutation carriers than noncarriers. Compared with a reference group with LDL cholesterol <130 mg/dl and no mutation, participants with LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl and no FH mutation had a 6-fold higher risk for CAD (odds ratio: 6.0; 95% confidence interval: 5.2 to 6.9), whereas those with both LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl and an FH mutation demonstrated a 22-fold increased risk (odds ratio: 22.3; 95% confidence interval: 10.7 to 53.2). In an analysis of participants with serial lipid measurements over many years, FH mutation carriers had higher cumulative exposure to LDL cholesterol than noncarriers. Among participants with LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl, gene sequencing identified an FH mutation in <2%. However, for any observed LDL cholesterol, FH mutation carriers had substantially increased risk for CAD.	4
LMNA, encoding lamin A/C, is mutated in partial lipodystrophy. ||  || The lipodystrophies are a group of disorders characterized by the absence or reduction of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Partial lipodystrophy (PLD; MIM 151660) is an inherited condition in which a regional (trunk and limbs) loss of fat occurs during the peri-pubertal phase. Additionally, variable degrees of resistance to insulin action, together with a hyperlipidaemic state, may occur and simulate the metabolic features commonly associated with predisposition to atherosclerotic disease. The PLD locus has been mapped to chromosome 1q with no evidence of genetic heterogeneity. We, and others, have refined the location to a 5.3-cM interval between markers D1S305 and D1S1600 (refs 5, 6). Through a positional cloning approach we have identified five different missense mutations in LMNA among ten kindreds and three individuals with PLD. The protein product of LMNA is lamin A/C, which is a component of the nuclear envelope. Heterozygous mutations in LMNA have recently been identified in kindreds with the variant form of muscular dystrophy (MD) known as autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss MD (EDMD-AD; ref. 7) and dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease (CMD1A). As LMNA is ubiquitously expressed, the finding of site-specific amino acid substitutions in PLD, EDMD-AD and CMD1A reveals distinct functional domains of the lamin A/C protein required for the maintenance and integrity of different cell types.	4 2
Germline BRAF mutations in Noonan, LEOPARD, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes: molecular diversity and associated phenotypic spectrum. ||  || Noonan, LEOPARD, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes (NS, LS, and CFCS) are developmental disorders with overlapping features including distinctive facial dysmorphia, reduced growth, cardiac defects, skeletal and ectodermal anomalies, and variable cognitive deficits. Dysregulated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal traffic has been established to represent the molecular pathogenic cause underlying these conditions. To investigate the phenotypic spectrum and molecular diversity of germline mutations affecting BRAF, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase functioning as a RAS effector frequently mutated in CFCS, subjects with a diagnosis of NS (N=270), LS (N=6), and CFCS (N=33), and no mutation in PTPN11, SOS1, KRAS, RAF1, MEK1, or MEK2, were screened for the entire coding sequence of the gene. Besides the expected high prevalence of mutations observed among CFCS patients (52%), a de novo heterozygous missense change was identified in one subject with LS (17%) and five individuals with NS (1.9%). Mutations mapped to multiple protein domains and largely did not overlap with cancer-associated defects. NS-causing mutations had not been documented in CFCS, suggesting that the phenotypes arising from germline BRAF defects might be allele specific. Selected mutant BRAF proteins promoted variable gain of function of the kinase, but appeared less activating compared to the recurrent cancer-associated p.Val600Glu mutant. Our findings provide evidence for a wide phenotypic diversity associated with mutations affecting BRAF, and occurrence of a clinical continuum associated with these molecular lesions.	4
Low-density lipoprotein receptor gene familial hypercholesterolemia variant database: update and pathological assessment. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is caused predominately by variants in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR). We report here an update of the UCL LDLR variant database to include variants reported in the literature and in-house between 2008 and 2010, transfer of the database to LOVDv.2.0 platform (https://grenada.lumc.nl/LOVD2/UCL-Heart/home.php?select_db=LDLR) and pathogenicity analysis. The database now contains over 1288 different variants reported in FH patients: 55% exonic substitutions, 22% exonic small rearrangements (<100 bp), 11% large rearrangements (>100 bp), 2% promoter variants, 10% intronic variants and 1 variant in the 3' untranslated sequence. The distribution and type of newly reported variants closely matches that of the 2008 database, and we have used these variants (n= 223) as a representative sample to assess the utility of standard open access software (PolyPhen, SIFT, refined SIFT, Neural Network Splice Site Prediction Tool, SplicePort and NetGene2) and additional analyses (Single Amino Acid Polymorphism database, analysis of conservation and structure and Mutation Taster) for pathogenicity prediction. In combination, these techniques have enabled us to assign with confidence pathogenic predictions to 8/8 in-frame small rearrangements and 8/9 missense substitutions with previously discordant results from PolyPhen and SIFT analysis. Overall, we conclude that 79% of the reported variants are likely to be disease causing.	4
Familial hypercholesterolemia in Brazil: cascade screening program, clinical and genetic aspects. || Apolipoprotein B Cascade screening Familial hypercholesterolemia Index patient Low density lipoprotein receptor Mutations || There is little knowledge about familial hypercholesterolemia in Brazil. This study presents the first results of genetic cascade screening performed in the city of Sao Paulo. Two-hundred and forty-eight suspected index cases were initially included. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and the complete coding sequence of low-density lipoprotein receptor, exon 7 of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene and part of exon 26 of apolipoprotein B genes were sequenced. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification was performed on cases where a causal mutation was not identified through sequencing. After the identification of a causal mutation screening in first-degree relatives was pursued. From 248 index cases, a mutation was found in 125 individuals (50.4%). 394 relatives were included in the cascade screening program and a mutation was identified in 59.4%. Seventy different causal mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (97.2%) and 2 in the apolipoprotein B gene (2.8%) were found. No mutations were encountered in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene. Mutations in exons 14 and 4 were the most prevalent and, 10 cases of true homozygotes (8 index cases and 2 relatives) and 1 compound heterozygote were identified. The most frequent mutation found was of Lebanese origin, the p.(Cys681*) mutation in exon 14 (8.5%). Genetic familial hypercholesterolemia cascade screening is feasible in Brazil and leads to identification of a mutation in approximately half of the index cases with higher rates of success in their relatives.	4
Genetic testing of Korean familial hypercholesterolemia using whole-exome sequencing. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder with an increased risk of early-onset coronary artery disease. Although some clinically diagnosed FH cases are caused by mutations in LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9, mutation detection rates and profiles can vary across ethnic groups. In this study, we aimed to provide insight into the spectrum of FH-causing mutations in Koreans. Among 136 patients referred for FH, 69 who met Simon Broome criteria with definite family history were enrolled. By whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis, we confirmed that the 3 known FH-related genes accounted for genetic causes in 23 patients (33.3%). A substantial portion of the mutations (19 of 23 patients, 82.6%) resulted from 17 mutations and 2 copy number deletions in LDLR gene. Two mutations each in the APOB and PCSK9 genes were verified. Of these anomalies, two frameshift deletions in LDLR and one mutation in PCSK9 were identified as novel causative mutations. In particular, one novel mutation and copy number deletion were validated by co-segregation in their relatives. This study confirmed the utility of genetic diagnosis of FH through WES.	4
Mutationally induced disulfide bond formation within the third extracellular loop causes melanocortin 4 receptor inactivation in patients with obesity. ||  || By screening patients with severe early onset obesity for mutations within the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene, we have identified a missense mutation (C271R) that occurs homozygous in two siblings with obesity. In-depth functional characterization of C271R revealed a right-shifted concentration response curve due to lower affinity to natural and synthetic MC4R agonists and a reduced cell surface expression. Cys-271 is located in the third extracellular loop. Here, we provide evidence that Cys-271 forms an intra-loop disulfide bond with Cys-277. Unexpectedly, we found that loss of receptor function is not only caused by the disruption of this disulfide bridge. Our data strongly support a new mechanism in which the receptor malfunction in the C271R mutant is induced by formation of a functionally disastrous disulfide bridge between Cys-277 and a third Cys residue at position 279. Mutational and chemical disruption of this improper disulfide bond was able to restore normal receptor potency. By demonstrating that a loss of a disulfide bond-participating Cys residue can favor a functionally disastrous disulfide bond, we now add a new mechanism of how Cys residues can be involved in G-protein-coupled receptor malfunction.	4 0 2
Selective chaperone effect of aminocyclitol derivatives on G202R and other mutant glucocerebrosidases causing Gaucher disease. || Fibroblast G202R mutation Gaucher disease Glucosylceramide Pharmacological chaperone || Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder characterized by the accumulation of glucosylceramide as a result of a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Several competitive glucocerebrosidase inhibitors are able to act as pharmacological chaperones for an efficient rescue of the mutated, misfolded forms of the enzyme. Along this line, we report in this work on the ability of several aminocyclitols to increase the residual glucocerebrosidase activity in patient fibroblasts with different genotypes. Some of the compounds were slightly active on fibroblasts bearing some mutations, including the highly prevalent N370S mutation. All compounds were highly active as enzyme activity enhancers on fibroblasts from Gaucher disease patients containing the G202R mutation. Moreover, using the novel tagged sphingolipid ω-azidosphingosine, a reduction in the tagged glucosylceramide accumulation was also observed for selected aminocyclitols. Attempts to explain the activity impairment observed in glucocerebrosidase bearing the G202R mutation by comparative molecular dynamic studies on wild type and the G202R mutated proteins (free and isofagomine-bound, in both cases) were unsuccessful. Under the simulation conditions used, no clear effect of the G202R mutation neither over the global structure of the protein nor on the loops that constitute the glucocerebrosidase active site was observed. Since the G202R residue is located on the protein surface, altered protein-membrane or protein-protein interactions could account for the observed differences. In conclusion, we have tested novel compounds that have shown some chaperone effect on particular glucocerebrosidase mutant enzymes, supporting the enhancement therapy as an alternative approach for Gaucher disease.	0
Glucosylceramide and Glucosylsphingosine Quantitation by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry to Enable In Vivo Preclinical Studies of Neuronopathic Gaucher Disease. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme acid β-glucosidase (GCase). Reduced GCase activity primarily leads to the accumulation of two substrates, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph). Current treatment options have not been shown to ameliorate the neurological pathology observed in the most severe forms of GD, clearly representing an unmet medical need. To better understand the relationship between GlcCer and GlcSph accumulation and ultimately their connection with the progression of neurological pathology, we developed LC-MS/MS methods to quantify GlcCer and GlcSph in mouse brain tissue. A significant challenge in developing these methods was the chromatographic separation of GlcCer and GlcSph from the far more abundant isobaric galactosyl epimers naturally occurring in white matter. After validation of both methods, we evaluated the levels of both substrates in five different GD mouse models, and found significant elevation of brain GlcSph in all five, while GlcCer was elevated in only one of the five models. In addition, we measured GlcCer and GlcSph levels in the brains of wild-type mice after administration of the GCase inhibitor conduritol β-epoxide (CBE), as well as the nonlysosomal β-glucosidase (GBA2) inhibitor N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ). Inhibition of GCase by CBE resulted in elevation of both sphingolipids; however, inhibition of GBA2 by NB-DGJ resulted in elevation of GlcCer only. Taken together, these data support the idea that GlcSph is a more selective and sensitive biomarker than GlcCer for neuronopathic GD in preclinical models.	0
New Directions in Gaucher Disease. || Gaucher disease Parkinson disease Unfolded Protein Response glucocerebrosidase induced pleuripotent stem cells || In Gaucher disease (GD), mutant lysosomal acid β-glucocerebrosidase fails to properly hydrolyze its substrate, glucosylceramide, which accumulates in the lysosomes. Due to its phenotypic heterogeneity, GD has been classified into type 1, non-neuronopathic, and types 2 and 3, the neuronopathic forms, based on the primary involvement of the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation and necroptotic death may appear in the neuronopathic forms of GD, whereas type 1 GD patients may develop Parkinson disease (PD), a prototype of protein misfolding disorders of the nervous system. PD is significantly more prevalent among GD carriers and patients than among the non-GD populations. It is apparent that the amount of mutant enzyme present in lysosomes depends on the amount of mutant enzyme recognized as correctly folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for physiologically correct transport through the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome. Mutant enzyme recognized as misfolded is retained in the ER, inducing the Unfolded Protein Response. In the current review, we present three discrete areas of interest: molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the association between GD and PD; the clinical and genetic associations between GD and PD; and treatment options for GD. We also discuss the relevance of induced pleuripotent stem cells to the above associations.	0
Identification and functional characterization of LDLR mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia patients from Southern Italy. ||  || Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemias are due to defects in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene, in the apolipoprotein B-100 gene or in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene. The aim of this study was to identify and functionally characterize mutations in the LDLR gene that account for most cases of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). We enrolled 56 unrelated patients from Southern Italy with a clinical diagnosis of FH. The mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing of the promoter and the 18 exons of the LDLR gene and by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to search for large rearrangements. We found 5 new mutations, the causative role of which was demonstrated by functional characterization performed by quantification of fluorescent LDL uptake in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes. These results enlarge the spectrum of FH-causative LDLR mutations. Lastly, screening for large rearrangements is highly recommended for the genetic diagnosis of FH.	4
Receptor-associated protein facilitates proper folding and maturation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and its class 2 mutants. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia is the consequence of various mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). In the current study, we show that a specialized molecular chaperone, the receptor-associated protein (RAP), promotes proper folding and subsequent exocytic trafficking of the wild-type LDLR and several of its class 2 mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-RAP antibody demonstrates that RAP interacts with the LDLR. Kinetic analyses of LDLR posttranslational folding and maturation in the absence or presence of RAP coexpression show that RAP prevents aggregation and promotes the maturation of the LDLR. Additionally, depletion of Ca(2+) in intact cells impairs LDLR folding, and coexpression of RAP partially corrects this misfolding. Finally, we show that the increased mature cell surface LDLR in the presence of RAP coexpression is functional in its ability to endocytose and degrade (125)I-LDL. Taken together, our results show that the folding, trafficking, and maturation of the LDLR and its class 2 mutants are promoted by RAP.	0
Focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism clearly detectable by contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging. ||  || The focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is characterized by a cluster of abnormal insulin-oversecreting β cells within a restricted area of the pancreas. Although identification of the focal lesion is very important in the management of CHI, it has been reported that imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, or angiography, are not helpful in identifying the focal lesion. Currently, fluorine-18-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography ((18)F-DOPA PET) is believed to be the only imaging modality that can identify the focal lesions. In this report, however, we present a case of a 7-month-old girl with the focal form of CHI, caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the ABCC8 gene, whose lesion was clearly visible as a hyperenhancing nodule on contrast-enhanced CT and dynamic MRI imaging.	4
Molecular and phenotypic characteristics of patients with phenylketonuria in Serbia and Montenegro. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism in Caucasians. PKU is caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Here, we report the spectrum and the frequency of mutations in the PAH gene and discuss genotype-phenotype correlation in 34 unrelated patients with PKU from Serbia and Montenegro. Using both polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 'broad-range' denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis/DNA sequencing analysis, 19 disease-causing mutations were identified, corresponding to mutation detection rate of 97%. The most frequent ones were L48S (21%), R408W (18%), P281L (9%), E390G (7%) and R261Q (6%), accounting for 60% of all mutant alleles. The genotype-phenotype correlation was studied in homozygous and functionally hemizygous patients. We found that the most frequent mutation, L48S, was exclusively associated with the classical (severe) PKU phenotype. The mutation E390G gave rise to mild PKU. For the mutation R261Q, patients had been recorded in two phenotype categories. Considering allele frequencies, PKU in Serbia and Montenegro is heterogeneous, reflecting numerous migrations over the Balkan Peninsula.	3
Frequency and clinical and molecular aspects of familial hypercholesterolemia in an endocrinology unit in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela. || Cholesterol Colesterol Endocrinology Endocrinología Familial hypercholesterolemia Hipercolesterolemia familiar Venezuela Xanthomas Xantomas || To assess the frequency and the clinical, biochemical, and molecular aspects of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in subjects attending an endocrinology unit. An observational, descriptive study evaluating 3,140 subjects attending the endocrinology unit of Centro Médico Orinoco in Ciudad Bolívar, Venezuela, from 7 January 2013 to 9 December 2016. The index cases were selected using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria. Plasma lipid levels were measured, and a molecular analysis was performed by DNA sequencing of the LDLR and APOB genes. Ten (0.32%) of the 3,140 study patients had clinical and biochemical characteristics consistent with FH. All but one were female. Three had first-degree relatives with prior premature coronary artery; and none had a personal history of this condition. Three patients were obese; three had high blood pressure; and no one suffered from diabetes. Three patients had a history of tendon xanthomas, and one of corneal arcus. LDL-C levels ranged from 191 to 486mg/dL. Two patients were on statin therapy. The genetic causes of FH were identified in four patients, and were LDLR gene mutations in three of them and an APOB gene mutation in exon 26 in the other. Approximately, one out of every 300 people attending this endocrinology unit in those four years had FH, and LDLR gene mutations were the most prevalent cause.	4
Two novel missense mutations in the LDL receptor gene causing familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || We have employed analysis of single-strand conformation polymorphisms to identify mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene causing familial hypercholesterolemia. Two familial hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes had abnormal single-strand conformation polymorphism patterns of exons 4 and 8. DNA sequencing revealed that the abnormal pattern of exon 4 was due to heterozygosity (G/T) at nucleotide 502. Nucleotide 502 is the first base of codon 147, and the G->T mutation (D147Y) changes this codon from AspGAC to TyrUAC. The abnormal pattern of exon 8 was due to heterozygosity (A/G) at nucleotide 1097. Nucleotide 1097 is the second base of codon 345, and the A->G mutation (Q345R) changes this codon from GlnCAG to ArgCGG. Based upon screening of 437 unrelated familial hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes, both D147Y and Q345R account for about 0.5% of the mutations causing familial hypercholesterolemia in Norway.	4
AlphaIIbbeta3 integrin: new allelic variants in Glanzmann thrombasthenia, effects on ITGA2B and ITGB3 mRNA splicing, expression, and structure-function. ||  || Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder characterized by an impaired platelet aggregation due to defects in integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (ITGA2B, ITGB3), a fibrinogen receptor. Mutations from 24 GT patients and two carriers of various origins, Caucasian, North-African and Asian were characterized. Promoter and exon sequences of alphaIIb and beta3 genes were amplified and directly sequenced. Among 29 identified mutations, 17 new allelic variants resulting from nonsense, missense and deletion/insertion mutations were described. RNA alterations were evaluated by using Web servers. The alphaIIb p.S926L, p.V903F, and beta3 p.C38Y, p.M118R, p.G221D substitutions prevented complex expression at the surface of COS-7 cells by altering the alphaIIb or the beta3 subunit structure. As shown by free energy analyses applied on the resolved structure of alphaIIbbeta3 and structural modeling of the mutant, the p.K253M substitution of beta3 helped to define a key role of the K253 in the interaction of the alphaIIb beta-propeller and the beta3 beta-I domains. finally, the alphaIIb p.Q595H substitution allowed cell surface expression of the complex but its corresponding c.2800G>T mutation is predicted to alter normal RNA splicing. In conclusion, our study yielded the discovery of 17 new GT allelic variants, revealed the key role of K253 of alphaIIb for the alphaIIbbeta3 complex formation and provides an additional example of an apparently missense mutation causing a splicing defect.	1 3 0
Novel mutations in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) that cause autosomal recessive (DFNB1) hearing loss. ||  || Mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene (GJB2) are associated with the type of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic neurosensory deafness known as "DFNB1." Studies indicate that DFNB1 (13q11-12) causes 20% of all childhood deafness and may have a carrier rate as high as 2. 8%. This study describes the analysis of 58 multiplex families each having at least two affected children diagnosed with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness. Twenty of the 58 families were observed to have mutations in both alleles of Cx26. Thirty-three of 116 chromosomes contained a 30delG allele, for a frequency of .284. This mutation was observed in 2 of 192 control chromosomes, for an estimated gene frequency of .01+/-.007. The homozygous frequency of the 30delG allele is then estimated at .0001, or 1/10,000. Given that the frequency of all childhood hearing impairment is 1/1,000 and that half of that is genetic, the specific mutation 30delG is responsible for 10% of all childhood hearing loss and for 20% of all childhood hereditary hearing loss. Six novel mutations were also observed in the affected population. The deletions detected cause frameshifts that would severely disrupt the protein structure. Three novel missense mutations, Val84Met, Val95Met, and Ser113Pro, were observed. The missense mutation 101T-->C has been reported to be a dominant allele of DFNA3, a dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. Data further supporting the finding that this mutation does not cause dominant hearing loss are presented. This allele was found in a recessive family segregating independently from the hearing-loss phenotype and in 3 of 192 control chromosomes. These results indicate that 101T-->C is not sufficient to cause hearing loss.	1
Recurrent missense mutations at the first and second base of codon Arg243 in human lipoprotein lipase in patients of different ancestries. ||  || Mutations in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene are the most common cause of familial chylomicronemia. Here we define the molecular basis of LPL deficiency in four patients of German, French, Dutch, and Chinese descent. We show that two of the probands of Dutch and Chinese origin have a previously described Arg243His mutation while the patients of German and French descent have a novel Arg243Cys substitution in their LPL gene. Haplotype analysis is in favour of two separate origins for the Arg243Cys substitution which together with the Arg243His mutation would implicate three recurrent mutations involving the first and second nucleotides of the codon encoding Arg243 of the LPL gene. The recurrent mutations affecting the first and second nucleotide of CGC coding for the normal Arg residue are support for the high mutability of CpG dinucleotides within the LPL gene.	4 0
Efficacy and safety of octreotide for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism: a prospective, open-label clinical trial and an observational study in Japan using a nationwide registry. || Congenital hyperinsulinism Hypoglycemia Octreotide || Octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analog, has been used for treating hypoglycemia caused by congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). However, octreotide has not been evaluated in clinical trials and has not been approved in any developed country. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of octreotide for diazoxide-unresponsive CHI through a combination of a single-arm, open-label clinical trial (SCORCH study) and an observational study to collect data on the clinical course of patients treated off-label in Japan (SCORCH registry). In the SCORCH study, 5 patients were stabilized (blood glucose > 45 mg/dL) by hypertonic glucose infusion, and treated by continuous subcutaneous octreotide infusion at a dose of 5-25 μg/kg/day. Continuous blood glucose monitoring was performed between -24 and +48 hours. In 3 patients, a clinically meaningful rise in blood glucose was achieved and therapy was continued. The glucose infusion was gradually decreased and stopped after 5, 11, and 174 days, respectively. In one case, remission of CHI was reached after 606 days and octreotide was discontinued. The SCORCH registry included 19 diazoxide-unresponsive patients treated by subcutaneous octreotide, by continuous infusion or multiple daily injections. Of the 17 patients treated with hypertonic glucose infusion, the infusion rate was reduced after 4 weeks to less than 50% in 11 patients (64.7%) and stopped in 9 (52.9%). During the combined observation period of 695.4 patient-months in both studies, no severe adverse events related to octreotide were observed. In conclusion, subcutaneous octreotide injection was effective and well tolerated in the majority of patients with diazoxide-unresponsive CHI.	4
Detection of common sequence variations of familial hypercholesterolemia in Taiwan using DNA mass spectrometry. || Agena iPLEX assay Agena's MassARRAY Chinese Familial hypercholesterolemia Genotyping || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a heterogeneous autosomal dominant disease. The genetic heterogeneity of FH requires low-cost, high-throughput, and rapid mutation detection technology to efficiently integrate genetic screening into clinical practice. The aims of the study were to customize the MassARRAY assay to (1) establish an FH mutation assay panel, comprising known point mutations located on FH-causing genes and (2) test the feasibility of the assay for screening FH patients residing in Taiwan who fit the clinical criteria of FH diagnosis. We designed a custom Agena iPLEX assay to detect 68 point mutations on FH-causing genes. First, the assay performance was verified by analyzing 180 previously sequenced subjects (120 with point mutations and 60 healthy controls), with the results being compared with those of Sanger DNA sequencing. Second, a blind study was carried out on 185 FH probands (44 definite FH and 141 probable/possible FH). In the first part of this study, only 1 discrepancy was found between the Agena iPLEX and Sanger sequencing genotyping results. In the blind study, a total of 62 probands with mutations were identified by both techniques. Five mutations were detected by Sanger sequencing assay only. The detection sensitivity and specificity rates of Agena iPLEX were 92.5% and 100%, respectively, in the blind study. The hands-on time for the Agena iPLEX assay was around 1 day. The custom-designed Agena iPLEX assay has high specificity and sensitivity for FH genetic screening. Considering its low cost, rapidity, and flexibility, the assay has great potential to be incorporated into FH screening in Taiwan.	4
Spectrum of mutations of familial hypercholesterolemia in the 22 Arab countries. || Arab countries Familial hypercholesterolemia Genotype-phenotype correlation LDL-C LDLR LDLRAP1 PCSK9 || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited genetic disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by a high serum LDL-cholesterol profile and xanthoma formation, and FH increases the risk of premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), and LDLRAP1 genes have been associated with FH. Although FH is a major risk for CVD, the disease prevalence and its underlying molecular basis in the 22 Arab countries are still understudied. This study aimed to analyze all peer-reviewed studies related to the prevalence of FH and its causative mutations in the 22 Arab countries. We searched five literature databases (Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar) from inception until June 2018, using all possible search terms to capture all of the genetic and prevalence data related to Arab patients with FH. A total of 5,484 titles and abstracts were identified; 51 studies met our inclusion criteria for the final systematic review. Fifty-one mutations in Arab patients with FH were identified in only eight Arab countries; 47 were identified in the LDLR gene, two in the PCSK9 gene, and two in LDLRAP1 gene. Twenty mutations in the LDLR gene were distinctive to Arab patients. A few studies reported prevalence estimates, ranging from 0.4% to 6.8%. This is the first systematic review to dissect the up-to-date status of the genetic epidemiology of Arab patients with FH. It seems that FH is underdiagnosed and that its prevalence is understudied due to the dearth of published information about Arab patients with FH. Therefore, there is a need for well-controlled genetic epidemiological studies on Arab patients with FH.	4
The molecular defects in lipoprotein lipase deficient patients. ||  || The underlying molecular defects that lead to a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase in two patients from different kindreds presenting with the familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome have been identified. Sequence analysis of amplified LPL cDNA of the patient from the Bethesda kindred revealed a single point mutation (G to A) at position 781 of the normal gene that resulted in the substitution of an alanine for a threonine at residue 176 and the loss of an SfaN1 site present in the normal LPL gene. Amplification of patient cDNA by the PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion with SfaN1 established that the patient is a true homozygote for the defect. The proband from the second kindred was found to be a compound heterozygote for two separate allelic mutations, including a T to C transition at nucleotide 836 and a G to A mutation at base 983 that led to the substitution of Ile194 by Thr and Arg243 by His, respectively. Transient expression of the mutant LPL cDNAs from both kindreds in human embryonal kidney-293 cells resulted in the synthesis of enzymatically inactive proteins, establishing the functional significance of the mutations.	0
Use of targeted exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool for Familial Hypercholesterolaemia. ||  || Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease, caused by mutations in LDLR, APOB or PCSK9, which results in high levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) leading to early coronary heart disease. An autosomal recessive form of FH is also known, due to homozygous mutations in LDLRAP1. This study assessed the utility of an exome capture method and deep sequencing in FH diagnosis. Exomes of 48 definite FH patients, with no mutation detected by current methods, were captured by Agilent Human All Exon 50Mb assay and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Variants were called by GATK and SAMtools. The mean coverage of FH genes varied considerably (PCSK9=23x, LDLRAP1=36x, LDLR=56x and APOB=93x). Exome sequencing detected 17 LDLR mutations, including three copy number variants, two APOB mutations, missed by the standard techniques, two LDLR novel variants likely to be FH-causing, and five APOB variants of uncertain effect. Two variants called in PCSK9 were not confirmed by Sanger sequencing. One heterozygous mutation was found in LDLRAP1. High-throughput DNA sequencing demonstrated its efficiency in well-covered DNA regions, in particular LDLR. This highly automated technology is proving to be effective for heterogeneous diseases and may soon replace laborious conventional methods. However, the poor coverage of gene promoters and repetitive, or GC-rich sequences, remains problematic, and validation of all identified variants is currently required.	4
Autoimmune disease and multiple autoantibodies in 42 patients with RASopathies. ||  || The association of RASopathies [Noonan syndrome (NS) and Noonan-related syndromes] and autoimmune disorders has been reported sporadically. However, a concomitant evaluation of autoimmune diseases and an assessment of multiple autoantibodies in a large population of patients with molecularly confirmed RASopathy have not been performed. The clinical and laboratory features were analyzed in 42 RASopathy patients, the majority of whom had NS and five individuals had Noonan-related disorders. The following autoantibodies were measured: Anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA, anti-SS-A/Ro, anti-SS-B/La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-Scl-70, anti-Jo-1, anti-ribosomal P, IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (aCL), thyroid, anti-smooth muscle, anti-endomysial (AE), anti-liver cytosolic protein type 1 (LC1), anti-parietal cell (APC), anti-mitochondrial (AM) antibodies, anti-liver-kidney microsome type 1 antibodies (LKM-1), and lupus anticoagulant. Six patients (14%) fulfilled the clinical criteria for autoimmune diseases [systemic lupus erythematous, polyendocrinopathy (autoimmune thyroiditis and celiac disease), primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), autoimmune hepatitis, vitiligo, and autoimmune thyroiditis]. Autoimmune antibodies were observed in 52% of the patients. Remarkably, three (7%) of the patients had specific gastrointestinal and liver autoantibodies without clinical findings. Autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies were frequently present in patients with RASopathies. Until a final conclusion of the real incidence of autoimmunity in Rasopathy is drawn, the physicians should be alerted to the possibility of this association and the need for a fast diagnosis, proper referral to a specialist and ultimately, adequate treatment.	4
LDL receptor cDNA sequence analysis in familial hypercholesterolemia patients: 5 novel mutations with high prevalence in families originating from southern Italy. ||  || We screened a group of patients from southern Italy with clinically diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) for mutations of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene. RNA from each proband was analysed by RT-PCR followed by complete cDNA sequencing. Among 51 unrelated FH families we detected 17 mutations affecting the coding region of the LDLR gene. Five of these mutations, designated R395P, L783fsinsG, IVS15-3C>A, IVS3+5G>A, and 1698-1704delCACCCTAinsGCCCAAT (ITL545MPN), have not yet been reported in the literature. Interestingly, the novel IVS15-3C>A splicing mutation was detected in 20% of our unrelated FH families, suggesting an unusually high prevalence in our local population. Hum Mutat 17:433, 2001.	4
Loss-of-function and residual channel activity of connexin26 mutations associated with non-syndromic deafness. ||  || Connexins are the protein subunits of gap junction channels that allow a direct signaling pathway between networks of cells. The specific role of connexin channels in the homeostasis of different organs has been validated by the association of mutations in several human connexins with a variety of genetic diseases. Several connexins are present in the mammalian cochlea and at least four of them have been proposed as genes causing sensorineural hearing loss. We have started our functional analysis by selecting nine mutations in Cx26 that are associated with non-syndromic recessive deafness (DFNB1). We have observed that both human Cx26 wild-type (HCx26wt) and the F83L polymorphism, found in unaffected controls, generated electrical conductance between paired Xenopus oocytes, which was several orders of magnitude greater than that measured in water-injected controls. In contrast, most recessive Cx26 mutations (identified in DFNB1 patients) resulted in a simple loss of channel activity. In addition, the V37I mutation, originally identified as a polymorphism in heterozygous unaffected individuals, was devoid of function and thus may be pathologically significant. Unexpectedly, we have found that the recessive mutation V84L retained functional activity in both paired Xenopus oocytes and transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, both the magnitude of macroscopic junctional conductance and its voltage-gating properties were indistinguishable from those of HCx26wt. The identification of functional differences of disease causing mutations may lead to define which permeation or gating properties of Cx26 are necessary for normal auditory function in humans and will be instrumental in identifying the molecular steps leading to DFNB1.	0
Clinical features of bilateral temporal bone xanthoma with LDLR gene mutation. || Bilateral Gene mutation Hypercholesterolemia LDLR Temporal bone Xanthoma || Here we presented a rare case of bilateral temporal bone xanthoma associated with type II hyperlipidemia. The lesion caused osteolytic destruction in mastoid air cells, auditory ossicles and bony labyrinth. The patient was operated on the symptomatic side and the lesion was totally removed. The type of LDLR gene mutation had been clarified for the members of the patient's family. This case was the first one regarding bilateral temporal bone leading to retroauricular swelling. The patient need life-long follow-up by either CT or MR imaging.	4 2
Comparison of Parkinson risk in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Gaucher disease and GBA heterozygotes. ||  || Information on age-specific risk for Parkinson disease (PD) in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) heterozygotes is important for understanding the pathophysiology of the genetic association and for counseling these populations. To estimate the age-specific risk for PD in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with type 1 GD and in GBA heterozygotes. The study included patients with GD from 2 tertiary centers, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel (n = 332) and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York (n = 95). GBA noncarrier non-PD spouse control participants were recruited at the Center for Parkinson's Disease at Columbia University, New York (n = 77). All participants were Ashekanzi Jewish and most patients (98.1%) with GD carried at least 1 N370S mutation. The main outcome measure was a diagnosis of PD. Diagnosis was established in patients with GD on examination. We used a validated family history interview that identifies PD with a sensitivity of 95.5% and specificity of 96.2% to identify PD in family members. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate age-specific PD risk among patients with GD (n = 427), among their parents who are obligate GBA mutation carriers (heterozygotes, n = 694), and among noncarriers (parents of non-PD, non-GD control participants, n = 154). The age-specific risk was compared among groups using the log-rank test. Among those who developed PD, patients with GD had a younger age at onset than GBA heterozygotes (mean, 54.2 vs 65.2 years, respectively; P = .003). Estimated age-specific risk for PD at 60 and 80 years of age was 4.7% and 9.1% among patients with GD, 1.5% and 7.7% among heterozygotes, and 0.7% and 2.1% among noncarriers, respectively. The risk for PD was higher in patients with GD than noncarriers (P = .008, log-rank test) and in heterozygotes than noncarriers (P = .03, log-rank test), but it did not reach statistical significance between patients with GD and GBA heterozygotes (P = .07, log-rank test). Patients with GD and GBA heterozygotes have an increased age-specific risk for PD compared with control individuals, with a similar magnitude of PD risk by 80 years of age; however, the number of mutant alleles may play an important role in age at PD onset.	4
Amino acid substitution (Ile194----Thr) in exon 5 of the lipoprotein lipase gene causes lipoprotein lipase deficiency in three unrelated probands. Support for a multicentric origin. ||  || Studies on the molecular biology of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency have been facilitated by the availability of LPL gene probes and the recent characterization of gene mutations underlying human LPL deficiency. Typically, missense mutations have predominated and show a preferential localization to exons 4 and 5. This distribution supports earlier studies attributing functional significance to residues encoded by these exons. We now report a further missense mutation within exon 5 of the LPL gene in three unrelated patients. Amplification of individual exons by the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing revealed a T----C transition at codon 194 of the LPL cDNA which results in a substitution of threonine for isoleucine at this residue. The catalytic abnormality induced by this mutation was confirmed through in vitro mutagenesis studies in COS-1 cells. Transfection with a LPL cDNA containing the codon 194 transition resulted in the synthesis and secretion of a catalytically defective protein. The Thr194 substitution was associated with two different DNA haplotypes, consistent with a multicentric origin for this mutation.	4 0 2
Type 2 diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism cause DNA double-strand breaks and p53 activity in β cells. ||  || β cell failure in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with hyperglycemia, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Congenital hyperinsulinism caused by glucokinase mutations (GCK-CHI) is associated with β cell replication and apoptosis. Here, we show that genetic activation of β cell glucokinase, initially triggering replication, causes apoptosis associated with DNA double-strand breaks and activation of the tumor suppressor p53. ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels) and calcineurin mediate this toxic effect. Toxicity of long-term glucokinase overactivity was confirmed by finding late-onset diabetes in older members of a GCK-CHI family. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic treatment or p53 deletion rescues β cells from glucokinase-induced death, but only GLP-1 analog rescues β cell function. DNA damage and p53 activity in T2D suggest shared mechanisms of β cell failure in hyperglycemia and CHI. Our results reveal membrane depolarization via KATP channels, calcineurin signaling, DNA breaks, and p53 as determinants of β cell glucotoxicity and suggest pharmacological approaches to enhance β cell survival in diabetes.	4
Structural and biochemical characterization of the wild type PCSK9-EGF(AB) complex and natural familial hypercholesterolemia mutants. ||  || PCSK9 regulates low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) levels and consequently is a target for the prevention of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Here we studied the interaction, of LDLR EGF(A/AB) repeats with PCSK9. We show that PCSK9 binds the EGF(AB) repeats in a pH-dependent manner. Although the PCSK9 C-terminal domain is not involved in LDLR binding, PCSK9 autocleavage is required. Moreover, we report the x-ray structure of the PCSK9DeltaC-EGF(AB) complex at neutral pH. Compared with the low pH PCSK9-EGF(A) structure, the new structure revealed rearrangement of the EGF(A) His-306 side chain and disruption of the salt bridge with PCSK9 Asp-374, thus suggesting the basis for enhanced interaction at low pH. In addition, the structure of PCSK9DeltaC bound to EGF(AB)(H306Y), a mutant associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), reveals that the Tyr-306 side chain forms a hydrogen bond with PCSK9 Asp-374, thus mimicking His-306 in the low pH conformation. Consistently, Tyr-306 confers increased affinity for PCSK9. Importantly, we found that although the EGF(AB)(H306Y)-PCSK9 interaction is pH-independent, LDLR(H306Y) binds PCSK9 50-fold better at low pH, suggesting that factors other than His-306 contribute to the pH dependence of PCSK9-LDLR binding. Further, we determined the structures of EGF(AB) bound to PCSK9DeltaC containing the FH-associated D374Y and D374H mutations, revealing additional interactions with EGF(A) mediated by Tyr-374/His-374 and providing a rationale for their disease phenotypes. Finally, we report the inhibitory properties of EGF repeats in a cellular assay measuring LDL uptake.	0
Patient homozygous for a recessive POLG mutation presents with features of MERRF. ||  || Both dominant and recessive missense mutations were recently reported in the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) in patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). The authors report on a patient homozygous for a recessive missense mutation in POLG who presented with a multisystem disorder without PEO. The most prominent features were myoclonus, seizure, and sensory ataxic neuropathy, so the clinical picture overlapped with the syndrome of myoclonus, epilepsy, and ragged red fibers (MERRF).	2
Structural and functional consequences of missense mutations in exon 5 of the lipoprotein lipase gene. ||  || Missense mutations in exon 5 of the LPL gene are the most common reported cause of LPL deficiency. Exon 5 is also the region with the strongest homology to pancreatic and hepatic lipase, and is conserved in LPL from different species. Mutant LPL proteins from post-heparin plasma from patients homozygous for missense mutations at amino acid positions 176, 188, 194, 205, and 207, and from COS cells transiently transfected with the corresponding cDNAs were quantified and characterized, in an attempt to determine which aspect of enzyme function was affected by each specific mutation. All but one of the mutant proteins were present, mainly as partially denatured LPL monomer, rendering further detailed assessment of their catalytic activity, affinity to heparin, and binding to lipoprotein particles difficult. However, the fresh unstable Gly(188)-->Glu LPL and the stable Ile(194)-->Thr LPL, although in native conformation, did not express lipase activity. It is proposed that many of the exon 5 mutant proteins are unable to achieve or maintain native dimer conformation, and that the Ile(194)-->Thr substitution interferes with access of lipid substrate to the catalytic pocket. These results stress the importance of conformational evaluation of mutant LPL. Absence of catalytic activity does not necessarily imply that the substituted amino acid plays a specific direct role in catalysis.	0
Tubular proteinuria in patients with HNF1α mutations: HNF1α drives endocytosis in the proximal tubule. || diabetes insipidus endocytosis proximal tubule transcription regulation || Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) is a transcription factor expressed in the liver, pancreas, and proximal tubule of the kidney. Mutations of HNF1α cause an autosomal dominant form of diabetes mellitus (MODY-HNF1A) and tubular dysfunction. To gain insights into the role of HNF1α in the proximal tubule, we analyzed Hnf1a-deficient mice. Compared with wild-type littermates, Hnf1a knockout mice showed low-molecular-weight proteinuria and a 70% decrease in the uptake of β2-microglobulin, indicating a major endocytic defect due to decreased expression of megalin/cubilin receptors. We identified several binding sites for HNF1α in promoters of Lrp2 and Cubn genes encoding megalin and cubilin, respectively. The functional interaction of HNF1α with these promoters was shown in C33 epithelial cells lacking endogenous HNF1α. Defective receptor-mediated endocytosis was confirmed in proximal tubule cells from these knockout mice and could be rescued by transfection of wild-type but not mutant HNF1α. Transfection of human proximal tubule HK2 cells with HNF1α was able to upregulate megalin and cubilin expression and to increase endocytosis of albumin. Low-molecular-weight proteinuria was consistently detected in individuals with HNF1A mutations compared with healthy controls and patients with non-MODY-HNF1A diabetes mellitus. Thus, HNF1α plays a key role in the constitutive expression of megalin and cubilin, hence regulating endocytosis in the proximal tubule of the kidney. These findings provide new insight into the renal phenotype of individuals with mutations of HNF1A.	4
Identification of the low density lipoprotein receptor-binding site in apolipoprotein B100 and the modulation of its binding activity by the carboxyl terminus in familial defective apo-B100. ||  || Familial defective apolipoprotein B100 (FDB) is caused by a mutation of apo-B100 (R3500Q) that disrupts the receptor binding of low density lipoproteins (LDL), which leads to hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis. In this study, mutant forms of human apo-B were expressed in transgenic mice, and the resulting human recombinant LDL were purified and tested for their receptor-binding activity. Site-directed mutagenesis and other evidence indicated that Site B (amino acids 3,359-3,369) binds to the LDL receptor and that arginine-3,500 is not directly involved in receptor binding. The carboxyl-terminal 20% of apo-B100 is necessary for the R3500Q mutation to disrupt receptor binding, since removal of the carboxyl terminus in FDB LDL results in normal receptor-binding activity. Similarly, removal of the carboxyl terminus of apo-B100 on receptor-inactive VLDL dramatically increases apo-B-mediated receptor-binding activity. We propose that the carboxyl terminus normally functions to inhibit the interaction of apo-B100 VLDL with the LDL receptor, but after the conversion of triglyceride-rich VLDL to smaller cholesterol-rich LDL, arginine-3,500 interacts with the carboxyl terminus, permitting normal interaction between LDL and its receptor. Moreover, the loss of arginine at this site destabilizes this interaction, resulting in receptor-binding defective LDL.	0
Familial partial lipodystrophy phenotype resulting from a single-base mutation in deoxyribonucleic acid-binding domain of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. ||  || Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) results from coding sequence mutations either in LMNA, encoding nuclear lamin A/C, or in PPARG, encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). The LMNA form is called FPLD2 (MIM 151660) and the PPARG form is called FPLD3 (MIM 604367). Our objective was to investigate whether the clinical phenotype of this proband is due to mutation(s) in PPARgamma. This is a case report. Patient and Setting: A 31-yr-old female with the clinical phenotype of FPLD3, i.e. lipodystrophy and early childhood diabetes with extreme insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia leading to recurrent pancreatitis, was assessed at an academic medical center. The proband was heterozygous for a novel C-->T mutation in the PPARG gene that led to the substitution of arginine 194 in PPARgamma2 isoform, a conserved residue located in the zinc finger structure involved in DNA binding, by tryptophan (R194W). The mutation was absent from the genomes of 100 healthy Caucasians. In vitro analysis of the mutated protein showed that R194W (and R166W in PPARgamma1 isoform) could not bind to DNA and had no transcriptional activity. Furthermore, R194W had no dominant-negative activity. The R194W mutation in PPARG disrupts its DNA binding activity and through haploinsufficiency leads to clinical manifestation of FPLD3 and the associated metabolic disturbances.	0
Infantile hepatocerebral syndromes associated with mutations in the mitochondrial DNA polymerase-gammaA. ||  || We studied nine infant patients with a combination of progressive neurological and hepatic failure. Eight children, including two sibling pairs and four singletons, were affected by Alpers' hepatopathic poliodystrophy. A ninth baby patient suffered of a severe floppy infant syndrome associated with liver failure. Analysis of POLG1, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase, revealed that all the patients carried different allelic mutations in this gene. POLG1 is a major disease gene in mitochondrial disorders. Mutations in this gene can be associated with multiple deletions, depletion or point mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In turn, these different molecular phenotypes dictate an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from adult-onset progressive ophthalmoplegia to juvenile ataxic syndromes with epilepsy, to rapidly fatal hepatocerebral presentations, including Alpers' syndrome.	3
Expanding the Mutation Spectrum Affecting αIIbβ3 Integrin in Glanzmann Thrombasthenia: Screening of the ITGA2B and ITGB3 Genes in a Large International Cohort. || Glanzmann thrombasthenia ITGA2B ITGB3 integrin αIIbβ3 molecular modeling || We report the largest international study on Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), an inherited bleeding disorder where defects of the ITGA2B and ITGB3 genes cause quantitative or qualitative defects of the αIIbβ3 integrin, a key mediator of platelet aggregation. Sequencing of the coding regions and splice sites of both genes in members of 76 affected families identified 78 genetic variants (55 novel) suspected to cause GT. Four large deletions or duplications were found by quantitative real-time PCR. Families with mutations in either gene were indistinguishable in terms of bleeding severity that varied even among siblings. Families were grouped into type I and the rarer type II or variant forms with residual αIIbβ3 expression. Variant forms helped identify genes encoding proteins mediating integrin activation. Splicing defects and stop codons were common for both ITGA2B and ITGB3 and essentially led to a reduced or absent αIIbβ3 expression; included was a heterozygous c.1440-13_c.1440-1del in intron 14 of ITGA2B causing exon skipping in seven unrelated families. Molecular modeling revealed how many missense mutations induced subtle changes in αIIb and β3 domain structure across both subunits, thereby interfering with integrin maturation and/or function. Our study extends knowledge of GT and the pathophysiology of an integrin.	1 3
Familial lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency: a catalogue of LPL gene mutations identified in 20 patients from the UK, Sweden, and Italy. ||  || The aim of this study was to identify mutations in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene in 20 unrelated patients with familial lipoprotein deficiency (FLLD) and to investigate the genotype/phenotype relationship. The previously reported G188E mutation (Monsalve et al., J Clin Invest 86:728-734, 1990) was screened for and found to be present in seven individuals (12/40 alleles). In addition, three patients were heterozygous for the 2.0 kb insertion (Langlois et al., Proc Nalt Acad Sci US 86:948-952, 1989). Two approaches were taken for new mutation detection; single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing to identify micro-mutations in the proximal promoter and exons 1-9 of the LPL gene and Southern blotting to identify gross mutations. Ten different point mutations were found (W86G, A158T, H183Q, G188E, S193R, P207L, L252X, N291S, M301T, L303P). Additionally, a two nucleotide deletion in exon 6 (delta1006-1007), a six nucleotide deletion in exon 8 (delta1441-1447), and a silent substitution in the wobble position of codon E118 were identified. In vitro mutagenesis and expression in COS-B cells suggested that the A158T and S193R substitutions virtually abolished enzyme activity. In analysing the genotype/phenotype relationship, there was no strong association between age at diagnosis, severity of symptoms, lipid levels, and the nature/position of the mutation. Triglyceride levels, however, were higher in compound heterozygotes compared to true homozygotes, possibly reflecting increased instability of heterodimers. Overall, 29 of 40 (72.5%) mutant alleles were identified. Failure to identify the mutation in 11 alleles might reflect the inadequacy of the method or the possibility that mutations lie within regions of the gene not screened in the study because of lack of availability of sequence.	4
A single amino acid substitution flanking the fourth calcium binding domain of alpha IIb prevents maturation of the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin complex. ||  || To define specific structural domains involved in the biosynthesis and processing of integrin subunits, we examined the biosynthesis of normal and mutated forms of the platelet-specific integrin alpha IIb beta 3. Platelet mRNA was isolated from a Glanzmann thrombasthenic patient who failed to express significant levels of the glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex on the platelet surface. Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified platelet GPIIb mRNA revealed a Gly418-->Asp amino acid substitution in GPIIb. Gly418 is a highly conserved residue that flanks the fourth calcium binding domain of GPIIb. Cotransfection of Asp418 GPIIb and GPIIIa plasmid constructs into COS-7 cells resulted in the accumulation of a pre-GPIIb-IIIa complex that failed to reach the cell surface, in effect recreating the thrombasthenic phenotype. Pulse-chase and endoglycosidase studies demonstrated that the biosynthetic blockade occurred in a pre-Golgi compartment. Removal of the negatively charged carboxyl group of Asp418 GPIIb, creating Ala418 GPIIb, rescued intracellular transport and surface expression of the integrin complex. Mutagenesis of a homologous Gly within the integrin alpha subunit alpha v also resulted in the failure to express alpha v beta 3 on the cell surface. These results suggest that the presence of a small, uncharged amino acid 6-8 residues amino-terminal to the calcium coordination complex is crucial for the proper folding and maturation of integrin complexes.	3 0
SOS1 mutations in Noonan syndrome: molecular spectrum, structural insights on pathogenic effects, and genotype-phenotype correlations. ||  || Noonan syndrome (NS) is among the most common nonchromosomal disorders affecting development and growth. NS is caused by aberrant RAS-MAPK signaling and is genetically heterogeneous, which explains, in part, the marked clinical variability documented for this Mendelian trait. Recently, we and others identified SOS1 as a major gene underlying NS. Here, we explored further the spectrum of SOS1 mutations and their associated phenotypic features. Mutation scanning of the entire SOS1 coding sequence allowed the identification of 33 different variants deemed to be of pathological significance, including 16 novel missense changes and in-frame indels. Various mutation clusters destabilizing or altering orientation of regions of the protein predicted to contribute structurally to the maintenance of autoinhibition were identified. Two previously unappreciated clusters predicted to enhance SOS1's recruitment to the plasma membrane, thus promoting a spatial reorientation of domains contributing to inhibition, were also recognized. Genotype-phenotype analysis confirmed our previous observations, establishing a high frequency of ectodermal anomalies and a low prevalence of cognitive impairment and reduced growth. Finally, mutation analysis performed on cohorts of individuals with nonsyndromic pulmonic stenosis, atrial septal defects, and ventricular septal defects excluded a major contribution of germline SOS1 lesions to the isolated occurrence of these cardiac anomalies.	4
Severe hypercholesterolemia in four British families with the D374Y mutation in the PCSK9 gene: long-term follow-up and treatment response. ||  || Analysis of long-term (30 years) clinical history and response to treatment of 13 patients with the D374Y mutation of PCSK9 (PCSK9 patients) from 4 unrelated white British families compared with 36 white British patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia attributable to 3 specific mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene (LDLR) known to cause severe phenotype. The PCSK9 patients, when compared with the LDLR patients, were younger at presentation (20.8+/-14.7 versus 30.2+/-15.7 years; P=0.003), had higher pretreatment serum cholesterol levels (13.6+/-2.9 versus 9.6+/-1.6 mmol/L; P=0.004) that remained higher during treatment with simvastatin (10.1+/-3.0 versus 6.5+/-0.9 mmol/L; P=0.006), atorvastatin (9.6+/-2.9 versus 6.4+/-1.0 mmol/L; P=0.006), or current lipid-lowering therapy, including LDL apheresis and partial ileal bypass in 2 PCSK9 patients (7.0+/-1.6 versus 5.4+/-1.0 mmol/L; P=0.001), and were affected >10 years earlier by premature coronary artery disease (35.2+/-4.8 versus 46.8+/-8.9 years; P=0.002). LDL from PCSK9 patients competed significantly less well for binding to fibroblast LDL receptors than LDL from either controls or LDLR patients. These British PCSK9 patients with the D374Y mutation have an unpredictably severe clinical phenotype, which may be a unique feature for this cohort, and requires early and aggressive lipid-lowering management to prevent cardiovascular complications.	4 2
Transcranial sonography in patients with Parkinson's disease with glucocerebrosidase mutations. ||  || The aim of this study was to search for possible differences in the findings of transcranial sonography (TCS) between groups of patients with glucocerebrosidase (GBA)-associated Parkinson's disease (PD) (4 patients with Gaucher disease type 1 and parkinsonism [GD+PD+] and 18 PD patients with heterozygous GBA mutations; [GBA+PD+]) and groups of 12 patients with Gaucher disease type 1 and no signs of parkinsonism (GD+PD-), 9 asymptomatic carriers of heterozygous GBA mutations (GBA+PD-), 32 sporadic PD patients (sPD), and 43 healthy controls. In all groups of patients, except asymptomatic carriers of heterozygous GBA mutations (mean ± SD: 0.16 ± 0.03 cm(2)), the maximal areas of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (aSN-max) was higher (GD+PD+: 0.28 ± 0.15 cm(2); GD+PD-: 0.18 ± 0.06 cm(2); GBA+PD+: 0.27 ± 0.06 cm(2); sPD: 0.28 ± 0.10 cm(2)) when compared to controls (0.12 ± 0.08 cm(2)) (p = 0.001). In GBA-associated PD (GD+PD+ and GBA+PD+) and sPD, aSNmax values were very similar. Moderate or marked SN hyperechogenicity was present in 87.5% of sPD patients and in 83% of PD patients with heterozygous GBA mutations, but in only 11.6% of controls, and in 22.2% and 33.3% of patients from GBA+PD- and GD+PD- groups, respectively (p < 0.001). The prevalence of interrupted or missing echogenicity of the brainstem raphe differed between the groups (p = 0.046), while no difference was observed in the diameter of the third ventricle. TCS findings in GBA-associated PD were consistent to those of patients with sporadic PD.	1 4
Failure of lamin A/C to functionally assemble in R482L mutated familial partial lipodystrophy fibroblasts: altered intermolecular interaction with emerin and implications for gene transcription. ||  || Familial partial lipodystrophy is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations of the LMNA gene encoding alternatively spliced lamins A and C. Abnormal distribution of body fat and insulin resistance characterize the clinical phenotype. In this study, we analyzed primary fibroblast cultures from a patient carrying an R482L lamin A/C mutation by a morphological and biochemical approach. Abnormalities were observed consisting of nuclear lamin A/C aggregates mostly localized close to the nuclear lamina. These aggregates were not bound to either DNA-containing structures or RNA splicing intranuclear compartments. In addition, emerin did not colocalize with nuclear lamin A/C aggregates. Interestingly, emerin failed to interact with lamin A in R482L mutated fibroblasts in vivo, while the interaction with lamin C was preserved in vitro, as determined by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The presence of lamin A/C nuclear aggregates was restricted to actively transcribing cells, and it was increased in insulin-treated fibroblasts. In fibroblasts carrying lamin A/C nuclear aggregates, a reduced incorporation of bromouridine was observed, demonstrating that mutated lamin A/C in FPLD cells interferes with RNA transcription.	4 0
Compound heterozygous polymerase gamma gene mutation in a patient with Alpers disease. ||  || Alpers disease is a mitochondrial depletion syndrome characterized by psychomotor retardation, intractable epilepsy, and liver failure. Polymerase gamma (POLG) gene mutations are a known cause of the disease. We describe a case in which a 14-month-old female presented with epilepsia partialis continua evolving into generalized status epilepticus. Treatment with multiple antiepileptic medications and the ketogenic diet eliminated her seizures, but she remained severely encephalopathic. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse atrophy of gray-matter structures. She ultimately developed liver failure and died. Mitochondrial analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for 3 POLG gene mutations, 2 of which were previously unreported.	1
Three novel pathogenic mutations in KATP channel genes and somatic imprinting alterations of the 11p15 region in pancreatic tissue in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism. ||  || This study was performed to investigate the molecular pathology underlying focal and diffuse congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). The ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were analyzed in 3 patients with focal CHI and in 1 patient with diffuse CHI. Immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) and microsatellite marker analyses of the 11p15 region were performed on both normal tissues and adenomatous hyperplasia lesions. The 3 patients with focal CHI harbored paternally inherited ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutations. Compound heterozygous ABCC8 mutations were identified in the patient with diffuse CHI. In the 3 patients with focal CHI, homozygous ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutations were identified within the lesions. MLPA and real-time PCR revealed the presence of two copies of 11p15. MS-MLPA and microsatellite analyses demonstrated abnormal imprinting patterns and focal loss of maternal 11p13-15 within the lesions. In contrast, parental heterozygosity was preserved in the normal tissue. In the patient with diffuse CHI, the two ABCC8 mutations were conserved, and imprinting patterns at 11p15 were normal. The epigenetic alteration at the 11p15 region plays a central role in developing focal CHI by paternally derived mutations of the KATP channel and maternal allelic loss at this region. MS-MLPA and microsatellite analyses are useful to investigate the molecular etiology of CHI.	4
Comparison of the genetic defect with LDL-receptor activity in cultured cells from patients with a clinical diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Regression Study Group. ||  || In this study we have analyzed the genetic defect in 42 patients with a diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) by Southern blotting, SSCP, and sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments of genomic DNA or sequencing of RT-PCR products from mRNA in cultured cells. The apoB Arg3500Gln mutation was identified in five patients. A molecular defect in the LDL-receptor gene was confirmed in 23 patients; 16 of these mutations have not been described before. No defect in the coding region, intron:exon junctions or proximal promoter of the LDL-receptor gene or in the region of the apoB gene coding for the LDL-receptor binding domain was found in the remaining 14 patients. LDL-receptor activity and protein content of cultured lymphoblasts from the patients was significantly lower in cells from patients with severe rather than mild LDL-receptor mutations. Cells from four patients with no detectable defect showed reduced LDL receptor activity compared with eight normal cell lines, whereas six others had reduced LDL-receptor activity but LDL-receptor protein content within the normal range. Cells from four patients appeared to have normal LDL-receptor function. Cells from two patients with a defined defect also had LDL-receptor activity within the normal range. The findings demonstrate the problems involved in the genetic diagnosis of FH in patients.	4 0
Successful treatment of a patient with ethylmalonic encephalopathy by intravenous N-acetylcysteine. || Acrocyanosis Developmental delay ETHE1 Ethylmalonic encephalopathy Meningococcemia Recurrent petechia || Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is an autosomal recessive devastating metabolic disorder affecting the brain, gastrointestinal tract, peripheral vessels and rarely the other vascular organs. We report a 10-month-old girl who presented as a meningococcemia clinic but later diagnosed ethylmalonic encephalopathy. Molecular analyses revealed a homozygous c.554 T > G; p. L185R mutation in ETHE1 gene. She was only partially benefited from riboflavine, coenzyme Q10, metronidazole, N-acetylcysteine and symptomatic treatment and discharged from hospital with the sequela of oxygene dependance and developmental delay. We observed N-acetylcysteine 100 mg/kg/day intravenous infusion theraphy may be the most important drug especially in comatous EE patients.	1
Glycomacropeptide for nutritional management of phenylketonuria: a randomized, controlled, crossover trial. || executive function inborn errors of amino acid metabolism medical food phenylalanine sapropterin dihydrochloride threonine tyrosine || To prevent cognitive impairment, phenylketonuria requires lifelong management of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentration with a low-Phe diet. The diet restricts intake of Phe from natural proteins in combination with traditional amino acid medical foods (AA-MFs) or glycomacropeptide medical foods (GMP-MFs) that contain primarily intact protein and a small amount of Phe. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a low-Phe diet combined with GMP-MFs or AA-MFs providing the same quantity of protein equivalents in free-living subjects with phenylketonuria. This 2-stage, randomized crossover trial included 30 early-treated phenylketonuria subjects (aged 15-49 y), 20 with classical and 10 with variant phenylketonuria. Subjects consumed, in random order for 3 wk each, their usual low-Phe diet combined with AA-MFs or GMP-MFs. The treatments were separated by a 3-wk washout with AA-MFs. Fasting plasma amino acid profiles, blood Phe concentrations, food records, and neuropsychological tests were obtained. The frequency of medical food intake was higher with GMP-MFs than with AA-MFs. Subjects rated GMP-MFs as more acceptable than AA-MFs and noted improved gastrointestinal symptoms and less hunger with GMP-MFs. ANCOVA indicated no significant mean ± SE increase in plasma Phe (62 ± 40 μmol/L, P = 0.136), despite a significant increase in Phe intake from GMP-MFs (88 ± 6 mg Phe/d, P = 0.026). AA-MFs decreased plasma Phe (-85 ± 40 μmol/L, P = 0.044) with stable Phe intake. Blood concentrations of Phe across time were not significantly different (AA-MFs = 444 ± 34 μmol/L, GMP-MFs = 497 ± 34 μmol/L), suggesting similar Phe control. Results of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function were not significantly different. GMP-MFs provide a safe and acceptable option for the nutritional management of phenylketonuria. The greater acceptability and fewer side effects noted with GMP-MFs than with AA-MFs may enhance dietary adherence for individuals with phenylketonuria. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01428258.	1
Somatic Mutations Activating the mTOR Pathway in Dorsal Telencephalic Progenitors Cause a Continuum of Cortical Dysplasias. || brain malformations cortical development epilepsy excitatory neurons focal cortical dysplasia hemimegalancephaly mTOR pathway next-generation sequencing single-cell sequencing somatic mutations || Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME) are epileptogenic neurodevelopmental malformations caused by mutations in mTOR pathway genes. Deep sequencing of these genes in FCD/HME brain tissue identified an etiology in 27 of 66 cases (41%). Radiographically indistinguishable lesions are caused by somatic activating mutations in AKT3, MTOR, and PIK3CA and germline loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5, NPRL2, and TSC1/2, including TSC2 mutations in isolated HME demonstrating a "two-hit" model. Mutations in the same gene cause a disease continuum from FCD to HME to bilateral brain overgrowth, reflecting the progenitor cell and developmental time when the mutation occurred. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated mTOR activation in neurons in all lesions. Conditional Pik3ca activation in the mouse cortex showed that mTOR activation in excitatory neurons and glia, but not interneurons, is sufficient for abnormal cortical overgrowth. These data suggest that mTOR activation in dorsal telencephalic progenitors, in some cases specifically the excitatory neuron lineage, causes cortical dysplasia.	4
Mutation analysis of phenylketonuria patients from Morocco: high prevalence of mutation G352fsdelG and detection of a novel mutation p.K85X. ||  || The knowledge of the molecular basis of the Phenylketonuria (PKU, MIM# 261600) in different countries provides relevant information for undertaking specific and rational mutation detection strategies in each population and for the implementation of adequate dietary and cofactor treatment. There are no data available in Moroccan population. In this work we describe the genetic analysis by mutation scanning using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and subsequent direct sequencing of 20 different PKU families from Morocco. We have also included the study of 7 Moroccan PKU patients living in Spain detected by the Spanish newborn screening program. The mutational spectrum in the first sample included eight different changes, one of them, p.K85X, was novel. The most common mutation was the frame shift change p.G352fsdelG identified in 62.5% of the mutant chromosomes studied. Other changes (p.R176X, IVS10nt-11 g>a, p.W120X, p.A165T, p.R243X and p.R243Q) were identified, respectively, in 2 or 3 mutant alleles. All detected mutations were severe according to the classical phenotype of the patients. In the 7 patients living in Spain we have detected 4 severe mutations (p.G352fs, p.R176X, Y198fs and Exon3del) and also milder changes such as p.A403V, p.S196T, p.D145V and p.R408Q detected in 3 mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) patients and a novel p.L258P found in a mild PKU patient. The results provide important information on the distribution of PKU mutations in this Mediterranean area gaining insight into the genetic epidemiology of the disease.	1
POLG mutations and Alpers syndrome. ||  || Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS) an autosomal recessive hepatocerebral syndrome of early onset, has been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion and mutations in polymerase gamma gene (POLG). We have identified POLG mutations in four patients with hepatocerebral syndrome and mtDNA depletion in liver, who fulfilled criteria for AHS. All were compound heterozygous for the G848S and W748S mutations, previously reported in patients with progressive external ophtalmoplegia or ataxia. We conclude that AHS should be included in the clinical spectrum of mtDNA depletion and is often associated with POLG mutations, which can cause either multiple mtDNA deletions or mtDNA depletion.	3
RASopathies: Clinical Diagnosis in the First Year of Life. ||  || Diagnosis within Noonan syndrome and related disorders (RASopathies) still presents a challenge during the first months of life, since most clinical features used to differentiate these conditions become manifest later in childhood. Here, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records referred to the first year of life of 57 subjects with molecularly confirmed diagnosis of RASopathy, to define the early clinical features characterizing these disorders and improve our knowledge on natural history. Mildly or markedly expressed facial features were invariably present. Congenital heart defects were the clinical issue leading to medical attention in patients with Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome. Feeding difficulties and developmental motor delay represented the most recurrent features occurring in subjects with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and Costello syndrome. Thin hair was prevalent among SHOC2 and BRAF mutation-positive infants. Café-au-lait spots were found in patients with LS and PTPN11 mutations, while keratosis pilaris was more common in individuals with SOS1, SHOC2 and BRAF mutations. In conclusion, some characteristics can be used as hints for suspecting a RASopathy during the first months of life, and individual RASopathies may be suspected by analysis of specific clinical signs. In the first year of life, these include congenital heart defects, severity of feeding difficulties and delay of developmental milestones, hair and skin anomalies, which may help to distinguish different entities, for their subsequent molecular confirmation and appropriate clinical management.	4
Analysis of human acid beta-glucosidase by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression. ||  || Structure/function relationships of acid beta-glucosidase, the enzyme deficient in Gaucher disease, were evaluated by characterizing the proteins expressed from cDNAs encoding normal and mutant enzymes. Twenty-two Gaucher disease mutations or created mutations were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and analyzed for catalytic properties, stability, inhibitor binding, and modifier interactions. Many Gaucher disease mutations encoded highly disruptive amino acid substitutions (e.g. P289L and D409V) and produced severely compromised proteins with very reduced activity (kcat < 1% of normal) and/or stability. Six mutant enzymes had sufficient catalytic activity (kcat approximately 5-30% of normal) for extensive studies. The highly conservative substitutions, i.e. F216Y or S364T and V394L, led to severe, but selective, abnormalities of enzyme stability or large decreases in catalytic activity, respectively. The T323I, N370S, and V394L enzymes interacted abnormally with active site-directed inhibitors and localized these residues to the glycon binding region. Selected mutant enzymes were poorly activated by phosphatidylserine (V394L, L444P, and R463C) or by saposin C (L444P and T323I), indicating that the enzyme sites for interaction with these activators were within the carboxyl one-third of the enzyme. Substitutions of Ser, Glu, and/or Gly at residues Asp-443 and/or Asp-445 demonstrated important steric roles for these residues in the active site, but neither is the catalytic nucleophile. Together with previous studies, the present analyses provide an insight into the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and the functional organization of acid beta-glucosidase.	1 4 0 3
Resequencing genomic DNA of patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (MIM 144650). ||  || The genetic determinants of severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG; MIM 144650) in adults are poorly defined. We therefore resequenced 3 candidate genes, namely LPL, APOC2, and APOA5, to search for accumulation of missense mutations in patients with severe HTG compared with normolipidemic subjects. We resequenced >2 million base pairs of genomic DNA from 110 nondiabetic patients with severe HTG and determined the prevalence of coding sequence variants compared with 472 age- and sex-matched normolipidemic controls. We found: (1) heterozygous mutations (LPL p.Q-12E >11X, p.D25H, p.W86R, p.G188E, p.I194T and p.P207L; APOC2 p.K19T and IVS2-30G>A) in 10.0% of severe HTG patients compared with 0.2% of controls (carrier odds ratio [OR] 52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.6 to 319); and (2) an association of the APOA5 p.S19W missense variant with severe HTG (carrier OR 5.5 95% CI 3.3 to 9.1). Furthermore, either rare mutations or the APOA5 p.S19W variant were found in 41.8% of HTG subjects compared with 8.9% of controls (carrier OR 7.4, 95% CI 4.5 to 12.0). Also, heterozygotes for rare mutations had a significantly reduced plasma triglyceride response to fibrate monotherapy. Both common and rare DNA variants in candidate genes were found in a substantial proportion of severe HTG patients. The findings underscore the value of candidate gene resequencing to understand the genetic contribution in complex lipoprotein and metabolic disorders.	4
Molecular and clinical analysis of Japanese patients with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism: predominance of paternally inherited monoallelic mutations in the KATP channel genes. ||  || Preoperative identification of the focal form of congenital hyperinsulinism is important for avoiding unnecessary subtotal pancreatectomy. However, neither the incidence nor the histological spectrum of the disease is known for Japanese patients. The aim of the study was to elucidate the molecular and histological spectrum of congenital hyperinsulinism in Japan. Thirty-six Japanese infants with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism were included in the study. All exons of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP) channel) genes (KCNJ11 and ABCC8), the GCK gene, and exons 6 and 7 and 10-12 of the GLUD1 gene were amplified from genomic DNA and directly sequenced. In patients with K(ATP) channel mutations, the parental origin of each mutation was determined, and the results were compared with the histological findings of surgically treated patients. In one of the patients with scattered lesions, islets were sampled by laser capture microdissection for mutational analysis. Mutations were identified in 24 patients (66.7%): five in GLUD1 and 19 in the K(ATP) channel genes. Sixteen had a paternally derived, monoallelic K(ATP) channel mutation predictive of the focal form. In 10 patients who underwent pancreatectomy, the molecular diagnosis correctly predicted the histology, more accurately than [18F]-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography scans. Three patients showed focal lesions that occupied larger areas of the pancreas. Preferential loss of the maternal allele was observed in these islets. The majority of the Japanese patients with K(ATP) channel hyperinsulinism (84.2%) demonstrated paternally inherited monoallelic mutations that accurately predicted the presence of the focal form.	4
Identifying monogenic diabetes in a pediatric cohort with presumed type 1 diabetes. || MODY diabetes mellitus type 1 genetic testing pediatrics || Monogenic diabetes (MD) is rare and can often be confused with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a pediatric cohort. We sought to determine clinical criteria that could optimally identify candidates for genetic testing of two common forms of MD that alter therapy: glucokinase (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α). We performed a retrospective chart review of 939 patients with a presumed diagnosis of T1D, 6 months-20 yr of age, and identified four clinical criteria that were unusual for T1D and could warrant further evaluation for MD: (i) negative pancreatic autoantibodies, (ii) evidence of prolonged endogenous insulin production, or (iii) strong family history of diabetes in multiple generations. One hundred and twenty-one patients were identified as having one or more of these high-risk clinical criteria and were offered screening for mutations in GCK and HNF1α; 58 consented for genetic testing. Of 58 patients with presumed T1D who underwent genetic testing, four were found to have GCK and one had HNF1α. No patients with only one high-risk feature were found to have MD. Of 10 patients who had two or more high risk criteria, five had MD (50%). A high frequency of MD from mutations in GCK/HNF1α may be identified among pediatric diabetic patients originally considered to have T1D by performing genetic testing on those patients with multiple clinical risk factors for MD.	4
Individualized screening for chaperone activity in Gaucher disease using multiple patient derived primary cell lines. || Ambroxol Gaucher disease chaperone therapy drug screening neuronopathic || The knowledge of individual response to a therapy, which can be assesed by <i>in vitro</i> screening, is essential for the development of therapeutics. Chaperone therapy is based on the ability of small molecules to fold the mutant protein to recover its function. As a novel approach for the treatment of Gaucher disease (GD), ambroxol was recently identified as a chaperone for GD, caused by the pathogenic variants in <i>GBA</i> gene, resulting in lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency. Since ambroxol activity is mutation-dependent, the assessment of the chaperone action requires adaptation of a cell model with genetic format identical to the patient. We compared the chaperone activity of ambroxol using different primary cells derived from GD patients with different <i>GBA</i> genotypes. Ambroxol enhanced GCase activity in cells with wild type <i>GBA</i> and in those, compound heterozygous for N370S, but was ineffective in cell lines with complex GBA alleles. In cells from patients with neuropathic GD and L444P/L444P genotype, the response to ambroxol was varied. We conclude that chaperone activity depends on diverse factors in addition to a particular <i>GBA</i> genotype. We showed that PBMCs and macrophages are the most relevant cell-based methods to screen the efficacy of ambroxol therapy. For pediatric patients, a non-invasive source of primary cells, urine derived kidney epithelial cells, have a vast potential for drug screening in GD. These findings demonstrate the importance of personalized screening to evaluate efficacy of chaperone therapy, especially in patients with neuronopathic GD.	1 4 3
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum and familial hypercholesterolemia: a deleterious combination of cardiovascular risk factors. ||  || Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum (PXE), an autosomal recessive disease due to mutations in ABCC6 gene, is characterised by fragmentation of elastic fibres with involvement of the cardiovascular system. We investigated a 60-year-old female with angina pectoris found to have PXE, associated with elevated plasma LDL-C suspected to be due to autosomal-co-dominant hypercholesterolemia. ABCC6, LDLR, PCSK9 and exon 26 of APOB genes were re-sequenced. Cardiovascular involvement was assessed by coronary angiography, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and ultrasound examination. The patient was a compound heterozygous for two ABCC6 mutations (p.S317R and p.R1141X) and heterozygous for a novel LDLR mutation (p.R574H). She had severe coronary stenosis and calcification of the arteries of the lower limbs. Treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/60mg/day, maintained over a 4.5-year period, reduced of LDL-C and the myocardial ischemic area. In PXE patients LDL-lowering treatment might contribute to delay macrovascular complications.	4 2
Chronic pain in Noonan Syndrome: A previously unreported but common symptom. || Noonan syndrome Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase chronic pain climate genotype-phenotype correlations growth hormone joint hypermobility medical genetics || Noonan syndrome (NS) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by pulmonic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, short stature, lymphatic dysplasia, craniofacial anomalies, cryptorchidism, clotting disorders, and learning disabilities. Eight genes in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway are implicated in NS. Chronic pain is an uncommon feature. To investigate the prevalence of pain in NS, we distributed a two-part questionnaire about pain among NS individuals at the Third International Meeting on Genetic Syndromes of the Ras/MAPK Pathway. The first part of the questionnaire queried demographic information among all NS participants. The second part was completed by individuals with chronic pain. Questions included musculoskeletal problems and clinical features of pain. Forty-five questionnaires were analyzed; 53% of subjects were female. Mean age was 17 (2-48) years; 47% had a PTPN11 mutation. Sixty-two percent (28/45) of individuals with NS experienced chronic pain. There was a significant relationship between prevalence of pain and residing in a cold climate (P = 0.004). Pain occurred commonly in extremities/joints and head/trunk, but more commonly in extremities/joints (P = 0.066). Subjects with hypermobile joints were more likely to have pain (P = 0.052). Human growth hormone treatment was not statistically significant among subjects without chronic pain (P = 0.607). We conclude that pain is a frequent and under-recognized clinical feature of NS. Chronic pain may be associated with joint hypermobility and aggravated by colder climate. Our study is a preliminary investigation that should raise awareness about pain as a common symptom in children and adults with NS.	4
Gaucher disease: single gene molecular characterization of one-hundred Indian patients reveals novel variants and the most prevalent mutation. || Chitotriosidase GBA1 gene Gaucher disease Glucocerebrosidase Indian population novel mutations in GBA1 gene p.Leu483Pro most common mutation β-Glucosidase || Gaucher disease is a rare pan-ethnic, lysosomal storage disorder resulting due to beta-Glucosidase (GBA1) gene defect. This leads to the glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency and an increased accumulation of undegraded glycolipid glucocerebroside inside the cells' lysosomes. To date, nearly 460 mutations have been described in the GBA1 gene. With the aim to determine mutations spectrum and molecular pathology of Gaucher disease in India, the present study investigated one hundred unrelated patients (age range: 1 day to 31 years) having splenomegaly, with or without hepatomegaly, cytopenia and bone abnormality in some of the patients. The biochemical investigation for the plasma chitotriosidase enzyme activity and β-Glucosidase enzyme activity confirmed the Gaucher disease. The mutations were identified by screening the patients' whole GBA gene coding region using bidirectional Sanger sequencing. The biochemical analysis revealed a significant reduction in the β-Glucosidase activity in all patients. Sanger sequencing established 71 patients with homozygous mutation and 22 patients with compound heterozygous mutation in GBA1 gene. Lack of identification of mutations in three patients suggests the possibility of either large deletion/duplication or deep intronic variations in the GBA1 gene. In four cases, where the proband died due to confirmed Gaucher disease, the parents were found to be a carrier. Overall, the study identified 33 mutations in 100 patients that also covers four missense mutations (p.Ser136Leu, p.Leu279Val, p.Gly383Asp, p.Gly399Arg) not previously reported in Gaucher disease patients. The mutation p.Leu483Pro was identified as the most commonly occurring Gaucher disease mutation in the study (62% patients). The second common mutations identified were p.Arg535Cys (7% patients) and RecNcil (7% patients). Another complex mutation Complex C was identified in a compound heterozygous status (3% patients). The homology modeling of the novel mutations suggested the destabilization of the GBA protein structure due to conformational changes. The study reports four novel and 29 known mutations identified in the GBA1 gene in one-hundred Gaucher patients. The given study establishes p.Leu483Pro as the most prevalent mutation in the Indian patients with type 1 Gaucher disease that provide new insight into the molecular basis of Gaucher Disease in India.	1 4
Mutations in the low-density-lipoprotein receptor gene in German patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDL), the formation of tendon and skin xanthomata and the development of premature coronary atherosclerosis. It is caused by a defect in the receptor-mediated hepatic uptake of LDL due to mutations in the LDL receptor. In 25 FH families with a total of 160 members and in two individuals without available relatives, all of German origin, we identified LDL receptor mutations by a multiplex-PCR-based single-strand conformation polymorphism method followed by direct sequencing. Of the 24 mutations found, 15 are missense mutations, 2 are nonsense mutations, 4 are small deletions or insertions leading to frameshifts, 2 are an in-frame insertion and deletion, respectively, and one is a splice site mutation. Propositi carrying mutations that are known to completely abolish receptor function (nonsense and frameshift mutations, missense mutation V480M) had significantly higher untreated total and LDL-cholesterol levels compared to those patients carrying missense and in-frame insertion mutations of unknown functional consequence, which may lead to either reduced or completely abolished receptor function (11.30+/-1.64 vs 9.76+/-1.50 mmol/L, and 9.39+/-1.23 vs 7.99+/-1.45 mmol/L, respectively). These results confirm the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of FH and the influence of different functional classes of mutations on lipid values.	4
Molecular basis of reduced glucosylceramidase activity in the most common Gaucher disease mutant, N370S. ||  || Gaucher disease is caused by the defective activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, glucosylceramidase. Although the x-ray structure of wild type glucosylceramidase has been resolved, little is known about the structural features of any of the >200 mutations. Various treatments for Gaucher disease are available, including enzyme replacement and chaperone therapies. The latter involves binding of competitive inhibitors at the active site to enable correct folding and transport of the mutant enzyme to the lysosome. We now use molecular dynamics, a set of structural analysis tools, and several statistical methods to determine the flexible behavior of the N370S Gaucher mutant at various pH values, with and without binding the chaperone, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin. We focus on the effect of the chaperone on the whole protein, on the active site, and on three important structural loops, and we demonstrate how the chaperone modifies the behavior of N370S in such a way that it becomes more active at lysosomal pH. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby the binding of N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin helps target correctly folded glucosylceramidase to the lysosome, contributes to binding with saposin C, and explains the initiation of the substrate-enzyme complex. Such analysis provides a new framework for determination of the structure of other Gaucher disease mutants and suggests new approaches for rational drug design.	0
267 Spanish Exomes Reveal Population-Specific Differences in Disease-Related Genetic Variation. || disease variants exome sequencing pharmacogenomic variants. population variability || Recent results from large-scale genomic projects suggest that allele frequencies, which are highly relevant for medical purposes, differ considerably across different populations. The need for a detailed catalog of local variability motivated the whole-exome sequencing of 267 unrelated individuals, representative of the healthy Spanish population. Like in other studies, a considerable number of rare variants were found (almost one-third of the described variants). There were also relevant differences in allelic frequencies in polymorphic variants, including ∼10,000 polymorphisms private to the Spanish population. The allelic frequencies of variants conferring susceptibility to complex diseases (including cancer, schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes, and other pathologies) were overall similar to those of other populations. However, the trend is the opposite for variants linked to Mendelian and rare diseases (including several retinal degenerative dystrophies and cardiomyopathies) that show marked frequency differences between populations. Interestingly, a correspondence between differences in allelic frequencies and disease prevalence was found, highlighting the relevance of frequency differences in disease risk. These differences are also observed in variants that disrupt known drug binding sites, suggesting an important role for local variability in population-specific drug resistances or adverse effects. We have made the Spanish population variant server web page that contains population frequency information for the complete list of 170,888 variant positions we found publicly available (http://spv.babelomics.org/), We show that it if fundamental to determine population-specific variant frequencies to distinguish real disease associations from population-specific polymorphisms.	4
Obesity and hyperinsulinemia in a family with pancreatic agenesis and MODY caused by the IPF1 mutation Pro63fsX60. ||  || We studied the genetic and clinical features of diabetic subjects in a 5-generation Michigan-Kentucky pedigree ascertained through a proband with pancreatic agenesis and homozygous for the IPF1 mutation Pro63fsx60. Diabetic and nondiabetic family members were genotyped and phenotyped. We also carried out genetic studies to determine the history of the IPF1 mutation in the Michigan-Kentucky family and a Virginia family with the same mutation. We identified 110 individuals; 34 are currently being treated for diabetes and 10 of these are Pro63fsX60 carriers (ie, MODY4). Subjects with MODY as well as those with type 2 diabetes are characterized by obesity and hyperinsulinemia. Genetic studies suggest that the IPF1 mutation was inherited from an ancestor common to both the Michigan-Kentucky and Virginia families. MODY4 and type 2 diabetes in the Michigan-Kentucky pedigree are associated with obesity and hyperinsulinemia. Obesity and hyperinsulinemia have been observed occasionally in other subtypes of MODY, which suggests that hyperinsulinemia may be a general phenomenon when obesity occurs in MODY subjects. Hypoinsulinemia in nonobese MODY subjects seems to be caused by a functional defect in the beta cell. Genetic testing should be considered in multigenerational obese diabetic subjects, particularly when such families contain young diabetic members.	2
The identification of eight novel glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations in patients with Gaucher disease. ||  || Mutations in the gene encoding for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA) result in Gaucher disease. In this study, seven novel missense mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (A136E, H162P, K198E, Y205C, F251L, Q350X and I402F) and a splice site mutation (IVS10+2T-->A) were identified by direct sequencing of three amplified segments of the glucocerebrosidase gene. Five of the novel mutations were found in patients with neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease, two of which, K198E and F251L, appear to be associated with type 2 Gaucher disease.	1 4
Gaucher disease paradigm: from ERAD to comorbidity. ||  || Mutations in the GBA gene, encoding the lysosomal acid beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), lead to deficient activity of the enzyme in the lysosomes, to glucosylceramide accumulation and to development of Gaucher disease (GD). More than 280 mutations in the GBA gene have been directly associated with GD. Mutant GCase variants present variable levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, due to their inability to correctly fold, and undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in the proteasomes. The degree of ER retention and proteasomal degradation is one of the factors that determine GD severity. In the present review, we discuss ERAD of mutant GCase variants and its possible consequences in GD patients and in carriers of GD mutations.	1 0
Spectrum of diverse genomic alterations define non-clear cell renal carcinoma subtypes. ||  || To further understand the molecular distinctions between kidney cancer subtypes, we analyzed exome, transcriptome and copy number alteration data from 167 primary human tumors that included renal oncocytomas and non-clear cell renal cell carcinomas (nccRCCs), consisting of papillary (pRCC), chromophobe (chRCC) and translocation (tRCC) subtypes. We identified ten significantly mutated genes in pRCC, including MET, NF2, SLC5A3, PNKD and CPQ. MET mutations occurred in 15% (10/65) of pRCC samples and included previously unreported recurrent activating mutations. In chRCC, we found TP53, PTEN, FAAH2, PDHB, PDXDC1 and ZNF765 to be significantly mutated. Gene expression analysis identified a five-gene set that enabled the molecular classification of chRCC, renal oncocytoma and pRCC. Using RNA sequencing, we identified previously unreported gene fusions, including ACTG1-MITF fusion. Ectopic expression of the ACTG1-MITF fusion led to cellular transformation and induced the expression of downstream target genes. Finally, we observed upregulation of the anti-apoptotic factor BIRC7 in MiTF-high RCC tumors, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for BIRC7 inhibitors.	4
Clinical pitfalls in the diagnosis of segmental overgrowth syndromes: a child with the c.2740G > A mutation in PIK3CA gene. || Hemihyperplasia Megalencephaly-capillary malformation syndrome Overgrowth PIK3CA gene || Overgrowth syndromes are known as a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by a generalized or segmental, symmetric or asymmetric, overgrowth that may involve several tissues. These disorders, which present a wide range of phenotypic variability, are often caused by mosaic somatic mutations in the genes associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cellular pathway, a signaling cascade that plays a key role in cellular growth. Overgrowth syndromes are frequently misdiagnosed. Given that they are also associated to an increased oncologic risk, it is important to distinguish the clinical characteristic of these disorders since the first months of life. We report the case of a seven-year-old male child with macrocephaly and right lateralized overgrowth, reported from birth. The patient arrived to our attention after an initial diagnosis of isolated benign macrocephaly was formulated at the age of 12 months. Afterwards, the child presented a moderate intellectual disability and pain episodes at right lower limb. We repeated a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging that revealed ventriculomegaly, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, a markedly thick corpus callosum, and white matter abnormalities. The diagnosis of segmental overgrowth syndrome was formulated according to the clinical presentation and confirmed by the finding of the variant c.2740G > A in the gene PIK3CA presented in somatic mosaicism. Our patient is the first children with the c.2740G > A variant in PIK3CA gene reported in Italy. We underline the importance of the genotype-phenotype correlation in the diagnostic process of overgrowth syndromes and emphasize the strict correlation between the mutation c.2740G > A in the PIK3CA gene and the Megalencephaly-Capillary Malformation syndrome phenotype.	4
The genetic spectrum of familial hypercholesterolemia in south-eastern Poland. || Familial hypercholesterolemia LDL-C gene score LDLR mutation || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with a frequency of 1 in 200 to 500 in most European populations. Mutations in LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes are known to cause FH. In this study, we analyzed the genetic spectrum of the disease in the understudied Polish population. 161 unrelated subjects with a clinical diagnosis of FH from the south-eastern region of Poland were recruited. High resolution melt and direct sequencing of PCR products were used to screen 18 exons of LDLR, a region of exon 26 in the APOB gene and exon 7 of PCSK9. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to detect gross deletions and insertions in LDLR. Genotypes of six LDL-C raising SNPs were used for a polygenic gene score calculation. We found 39 different pathogenic mutations in the LDLR gene with 10 of them being novel. 13 (8%) individuals carried the p.Arg3527Gln mutation in APOB, and overall the detection rate was 43.4%. Of the patients where no mutation could be found, 53 (84.1%) had a gene score in the top three quartiles of the healthy comparison group suggesting that they have a polygenic cause for their high cholesterol. These results confirm the genetic heterogeneity of FH in Poland, which should be considered when designing a diagnostic strategy in the country. As in the UK, in the majority of patients where no mutation can be found, there is likely to be a polygenic cause of their high cholesterol level.	4
Spectrum of LDLR gene mutations, including a novel mutation causing familial hypercholesterolaemia, in North-western Greece. ||  || Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a clinical syndrome characterised by elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, by tendon xanthomata and clinical manifestations of ischaemic heart disease in early life. Typically, it results from mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. Furthermore, there are 3 additional genetic disorders that cause clinical syndromes that mimic FH. These are: 1) familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein (apo)-B (FLDH), 2) familial hypercholesterolaemia type 3 (FH3) and 3) autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia (ARH). The aim of this study was to elaborate the impact of the above genetic disorders in Greek patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH. In this study, we assessed the contribution of the LDLR, Apo B, ARH and PCSK9 genes in the expression of FH in North-western Greece. Two hundred and fifty-four (254) probands with a clinical diagnosis of FH were included in the study. One hundred and sixty-nine (169) patients had one of the following LDLR gene mutations: 81T>G, 1775G>A, 517T>C, 858C>A, 1352T>C, 1285G>A, 761A>C, 1195G>A, 1646G>A and a deletion mutation g.387-410del24 in exon 4. We sequenced the Apo B, ARH and PCSK9 genes in 40, randomly selected patients, from the 85 patients with no identified LDLR gene defects. In these 40, randomly selected patients, with the exception of benign single nucleotide polymorphisms, no functional mutations were identified for all the above mentioned sequenced genes. Our results reveal substantial genetic heterogeneity for FH in North-western Greece with at least ten LDLR gene mutations present in the study population. One of these mutations although quite rare is reported here for the first time in the scientific literature. The detection of these mutations is important as they may be used to design multiplex detection assays for large scale population screening programmes to facilitate primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the region. Finally, ARH, Apo B and PCSK9 gene defects were excluded from causing FH in a subgroup of the study population indicating that other yet unrecognized genes may be involved in causing the clinical feature of FH, and/or that large scale deletions/duplications evaded the applied mutation detection techniques of this study.	4
Clinical and molecular analysis of RASopathies in a group of Turkish patients. ||  || The 'RASopathies' are a group of disorders sharing many clinical features and a common pathophysiology. In this study, we aimed to clinically evaluate a group of Turkish patients and elucidate the underlying genetic etiology. Thirty-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of one of the RASopathy syndromes were included in the study. Of these, 26 (83.8%) had a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome, whereas 5 had a clinical diagnosis of either Costello, LEOPARD or cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes. Twenty of 31 (64.5%) patients were found to be mutation positive. Mutations in PTPN11, SOS1 and SHOC2 genes were detected in patients with Noonan syndrome (57.6%). Mutations in MEK1, PTPN11, BRAF and HRAS genes were detected in the remaining. Pulmonary stenosis was the most common (61.5%) cardiac anomaly. Among Noonan syndrome patients with a confirmed mutation, mild intellectual disability tended to be more common in patients with PTPN11 mutation than in those with SOS1 mutation. Hematologic evaluation revealed coagulation defects in three Noonan syndrome patients with a mutation. This is currently the largest clinical and molecular study in Turkish RASopathy patients. Our findings indicate that molecular epidemiology and genotype-phenotype correlations in RASopathies are relatively independent from the ethnic population background.	4
Novel BRAF mutation in a patient with LEOPARD syndrome and normal intelligence. ||  || Noonan syndrome (NS) and related disorders are caused by mutations in various genes encoding molecules involved in the RAS-MAPK signalling cascade. There are strong genotype-phenotype correlations. BRAF is the major gene for cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), and usually patients with a BRAF mutation have significant cognitive impairment. We report on a patient with LEOPARD syndrome and normal intelligence who was found to carry a novel sequence change in BRAF. The mutation p.L245F was demonstrated to be de novo with no evidence of somatic mosaicism. This observation illustrates that the phenotypic spectrum caused by BRAF mutations is broader than previously assumed and that mental retardation is not necessarily associated. We speculate that the impact of p.L245F on BRAF protein function differs either qualitatively or quantitatively from those mutations associated with CFCS.	4
Continuous Intragastric Dextrose: A Therapeutic Option for Refractory Hypoglycemia in Congenital Hyperinsulinism. || Congenital hyperinsulinism Hypoglycemia Intragastric dextrose Nutrition Obesity Octreotide || Feeding problems are frequent in infants with congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) and may be exacerbated by continuous enteral nutrition (EN) used to maintain euglycemia. Our center's HI team uses dextrose solution given continuously via gastric tube (intrasgastric dextrose, IGD) for infants not fully responsive to conventional medical therapy or pancreatectomy. Here, we describe our practice as well as growth, feeding, and adverse events in infants with HI exposed to IGD. This was a retrospective cohort of infants with HI treated with IGD from 2009-2017. Primary outcomes were weight-for-length and body mass index Z-scores (WFL-Z and BMI-Z) in the year following IGD initiation. Secondary outcomes included EN use and adverse events. We used multivariable regression to assess covariates of interest. We studied 32 subjects (13 female) with a median age at IGD initiation of 73 days (range 17-367); median follow-up was 11.2 months (range 5.0-14.2). WFL-Z did not change significantly over time (p > 0.05). EN use decreased significantly over time, i.e., at 0 months: 72% (95% CI 53-85) vs. at 12 months 39% (95% CI 22-59). No potential adverse events led to discontinuation of IGD. Over a median follow-up of nearly 1 year, IGD was well-tolerated, with no change in WFL-Z or BMI-Z from baseline.	4
Molecular genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia in the Netherlands: a stepwise screening strategy enhances the mutation detection rate. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary vascular disease and is associated with mutations in the low-density liporotein receptor (LDLR) and apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene. The molecular basis of FH in the Dutch population is well understood. Approximately 160 different LDLR and APOB gene defects have been identified with a panel of 9 LDLR gene and 1 APOB gene frequently occurring mutations accounting for approximately 30% of all clinically diagnosed FH cases. As molecular diagnosis of FH is becoming increasingly widely applied, a variety of mutation detection rates is reported, ranging from as low as 30% and up to 80%. This variability appears to depend on the clinical criteria applied to identify patients with FH and on the strategies and methodologies used for mutation screening. In this study we describe the application of a stepwise screening approach, combining different methodologies, to detect mutations of the LDLR gene and APOB gene in 1465 patients with FH. A mutation was found in approximately 44% of the patients, which demonstrates that this is an effective strategy for the molecular diagnosis of FH.	4
Comparison of RNase A, a chemical cleavage and GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for the detection of mutations in exon 9 of the human acid beta-glucosidase gene. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD), which results from mutations in the human acid beta-glucosidase (beta-Glc) gene, was used as a model system to compare the utility of three methods capable of detecting single base substitutions. PCR-amplified beta-Glc exon 9 sequences of GD patients were screened for single base mutations by GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and RNase A cleavage of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes, and by chemical (hydroxylamine/osmium tetroxide) cleavage of dsDNA heteroduplexes. PCR products showing abnormal behaviour were cloned and sequenced. Three new point mutations were detected by this strategy. A G to C (Asp409 to His409) substitution was present in two Type 1 and one Type 3 GD patients; an A to T transversion (Asp409 to Val409) was detected in only a single Type 3 individual, and a G to T mutation (Val394 to Leu394) was present in one Type 1 and one Type 3 patient. GD thus exhibits extensive molecular heterogeneity, with at least five single base mutations in beta-Glc exon 9. In every case verified by ASO hybridization, DGGE had correctly identified the presence of the three new mutations, as well as the two previously described exon 9 mutations. In comparison, although RNase A and the chemical method were both able to detect some of these mutations, neither method reproducibly detected all of them. Additionally, DGGE was the only method that was able to reliably determine whether a given mutation was present homozygously or heterozygously. These results suggest that GC-clamped DGGE may be a more reliable and informative screening method for point mutation detection.	4
POLG mutations associated with Alpers' syndrome and mitochondrial DNA depletion. ||  || Alpers' syndrome is a fatal neurogenetic disorder first described more than 70 years ago. It is an autosomal recessive, developmental mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder characterized by deficiency in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) catalytic activity, refractory seizures, neurodegeneration, and liver disease. In two unrelated pedigrees of Alpers' syndrome, each affected child was found to carry a homozygous mutation in exon 17 of the POLG locus that led to a Glu873Stop mutation just upstream of the polymerase domain of the protein. In addition, each affected child was heterozygous for the G1681A mutation in exon 7 that led to an Ala467Thr substitution in POLG, within the linker region of the protein.	0 2
Uncovering the molecular pathogenesis of congenital hyperinsulinism by panel gene sequencing in 32 Chinese patients. || Clinical diagnosis congenital hyperinsulinism mutation spectra || Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) has been mostly associated with mutations in seven major genes. We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 32 patients with CHI. Extensive mutational analysis (ABCC8,KCNJ11,GCK,GLUD1,HADH,HNF4A, and UCP2) was performed on Ion torrent platform, which could analyze hundreds of genes simultaneously with ultrahigh-multiplex PCR using up to 6144 primer pairs in a single primer pool and address time-sensitive samples with single-day assays, from samples to annotated variants, to identify the genetic etiology of this disease. Thirty-seven sequence changes were identified, including in ABCC8/KCNJ11 (n = 25, 65.7%), GCK (n = 2), HNF4A (n = 3), GLUD1 (n = 2), HADH (n = 4), and UCP2 (n = 1); these mutations included 14 disease-causing mutations, eight rare SNPs, 14 common SNPs, and one novel mutation. Mutations were identified in 21 of 32 patients (65.6%). Among the patients with an identified mutation, 14 had mutations in ABCC8, one of which was combined with a GLUD1 mutation. Four patients had mutations in KCNJ11, 1 had a GCK mutation, 1 had a mutation in HADH, and two had a mutation in HNF4A. Among the 32 patients, the age at the onset of hyperinsulinemia ranged from the neonatal period to 1 year of age; five patients underwent a pancreatectomy due to intractable hyperinsulinemia. This study describes novel and previously identified mutations in patients with CHI. The spectrum of mutations in CHI patients represents an important tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of CHI patients in the Chinese population as well as for the genetic counseling of CHI families.	4
Homozygous point mutations in platelet glycoprotein ITGA2B gene as cause of Glanzmann thrombasthenia in 2 families. ||  || Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by quantitative and/or qualitative defects of the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa complex. Physiologically, the integrin GPIIb/IIIa binds Von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen on activated platelets. GT is caused by genetic alterations in ITGA2B or ITGB3 (genes encoding GPIIb and GPIIIa).This study describes 2 siblings diagnosed with GT type I associated with homozygous point mutations in ITGA2B. All patients presented with typical bleeding disorder including moderate hematomas, petechiae, and mucocutaneous bleedings.Both siblings showed severely reduced platelet aggregation especially after stimulation with collagen and adenosine diphosphate. Absence of platelet GPIIb/GPIIIa complex was determined using flow cytometry. Molecular genetic analysis revealed 2 distinct homozygous point mutations in exon 18 of ITGA2B. Family 1 was identified with c.1878G>C and family 2 with c.1787T>C substitution. While the c.1787T>C mutation causes a single amino acid substitution p.I565T, the c.1878G>C mutation (p.Q595H) is predicted to induce a mRNA splicing anomaly.These mutations were identified as cause of GT type I in the described patients. Patients with GT should be documented in a prospective register to verify the correlation between the severity of bleeding symptoms and the pathogenic mutation. This can have effects on therapeutic decisions.	1 3 2
Molecular genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia: spectrum of LDL receptor gene mutations in The Netherlands. ||  || Mutations in the LDL receptor are responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). At present, more than 600 mutations of the LDL receptor gene are known to underlie FH. However, the array of mutations varies considerably in different populations. Therefore, the delineation of essentially all LDL receptor gene mutations in a population represents a prerequisite for the implementation of nation-wide genetic testing for FH. In this study, the frequency and geographical distribution of 13 known mutations were evaluated in a cohort of 1223 FH patients. We identified 358 mutation carriers, representing 29% of the FH cohort. Four mutations (N543H-2393de19, 1359--1G-->A, 313 + 1 G-->A and W23X) occurred with a relatively high frequency, accounting for 22.4% of the entire study cohort. Two of these common FH mutations (N543H-2393de19 and 1359 - 1G-->A) showed a preferential geographic distribution. Second, to further expand the array of LDL receptor gene mutations, we conducted mutation analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) in 141 children with definite FH. A mutation was identified in 111 patients, involving 16 new single base substitutions and four small deletions and insertions, which brings the number of different FH-causing mutations in our country up to 61. Our data indicate that an estimate of the prevalence of specific mutations, as well as the compilation of a database of all FH-causing mutations in a given country, can facilitate selection of the most appropriate molecular diagnostic approach.	4
Detection of 12 new mutations in Gaucher disease Brazilian patients. ||  || Gaucher disease is the most frequent lysosome storage disease and presents an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is caused by mutations at the GBA gene leading to deficient activity of the glucocerebrosidase enzyme. This report describes 12 new mutations [c.38A>G (K-27R), c.220G>A (G35S), c.448G>A (E111K), IVS4+1G>A, c.746C>T (A210V), c.776A>G (Y220C), c.793delC (Q226_fs4X), c.1102C>T (R329C), c.1300C>T (R395C), c.1309G>A (V398I), c.1324-1326delATT (delI403) and c.1583T>C (I489T)] and 4 novel silent alterations [c.342C>T (F75), c.528C>T (D137), c.1011C>T (D298) and c.1092G>A (G325)] detected among 40 unrelated Brazilian type 1 Gaucher disease patients by a combination of RFLP, dHPLC and DNA sequencing procedures. The R329C mutation, previously described in a Parkinson's disease patient (A. Lwin, E. Orvisky, O. Goker-Alpan, M.E. LaMarca, E. Sidransky. Glucocerebrosidase mutations in subjects with Parkinsonism. Mol. Genet. Metab. 81 (2004) 70-73), is described here for the first time in a Gaucher disease patient. Several genotype-phenotype correlations could be established, contributing significantly to the panel of reported mutations and conferring predictive value to their detection.	1 4
Array-based resequencing for mutations causing familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a heterogeneous autosomal dominant disease with a prevalence of 1 in 500. To date, over 1200 unique pathogenic mutations have been identified in at least 3 genes. The large allelic and genetic heterogeneity of FH requires high-throughput, rapid, and affordable mutation detection technology to efficiently integrate molecular screening into clinical practice. We developed an array-based resequencing assay to facilitate genetic testing in FH patients. We designed a custom DNA resequencing array to detect mutations on all 3 FH-causing genes - LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene (PCSK9) - and 290 known insertion/deletion mutations on LDLR. We verified FH array performance by analyzing 35 previously sequenced subjects (21 with point mutations, 2 insertions, 7 deletions, and 5 healthy controls) and blindly screening 125 FH patients. The average microarray call rate was 98.45% and the agreement between microarray and capillary sequencing was 99.99%. The FH array detected mutations by using automated software analysis, followed by manual review in 28 of the 30 subjects (pickup rate, 93.3%). In the blinded study, the FH array detected at least 1 mutation in 77.5% of patients clinically diagnosed with definite FH according to Simon Broome FH criteria and in 52.9% with probable FH diagnosis. The high-throughput FH resequencing array detects LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 with high efficiency and accuracy and identifies disease-causing mutations. Thus, it facilitates large-scale screening of the heterogeneous FH populations.	4
Neurological and brain MRS findings in patients with Gaucher disease type 1. ||  || Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder, characterised by accumulation of glycosphingolipids in visceral organs. Although considered non-neuronopathic neurological involvement has been reported in single cases. The aim of our study was to investigate central and peripheral nervous system involvement in patients with GD1. We investigated nine unrelated patients with GD1 by three-dimensional cerebral 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and clinical and neurophysiological tests. We found an increased choline level on MRS in four patients. One of these patients had mixed axonal neuropathy and subclinical involvement of the central somatosensory tract as well as monoclonal gammopathy. One patient with normal cerebral choline levels had evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome upon neurophysiological exam. The N370S mutation was found in 11 out of 18 alleles. Three patients were compound heterozygous for the L444P mutation. There was no correlation between increased cerebral choline levels and type of mutations. MRS findings suggest that in patients with classical non-neuronopathic GD1, the brain is involved at a subclinical level in some patients.	1
Exome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations in NF1 and RASopathy genes in sun-exposed melanomas. ||  || We report on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 213 melanomas. Our analysis established NF1, encoding a negative regulator of RAS, as the third most frequently mutated gene in melanoma, after BRAF and NRAS. Inactivating NF1 mutations were present in 46% of melanomas expressing wild-type BRAF and RAS, occurred in older patients and showed a distinct pattern of co-mutation with other RASopathy genes, particularly RASA2. Functional studies showed that NF1 suppression led to increased RAS activation in most, but not all, melanoma cases. In addition, loss of NF1 did not predict sensitivity to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The rebound pathway, as seen by the induction of phosphorylated MEK, occurred in cells both sensitive and resistant to the studied drugs. We conclude that NF1 is a key tumor suppressor lost in melanomas, and that concurrent RASopathy gene mutations may enhance its role in melanomagenesis.	4
Clinical and Molecular Findings of Tunisian Patients with RASopathies. || BRAF Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome Noonan syndrome PTPN11 RASopathy RIT1 SOS1 || Noonan syndrome (NS) and related disorders, which are now summarized under the term RASopathies, are caused by germline mutations in genes encoding protein components of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In this study, we evaluated the clinical and molecular spectrum of 21 Tunisian patients, recruited by a cardiology unit, for whom RASopathy diagnosis was suspected by clinical geneticists. Overall, 19 patients had a clinical diagnosis of NS and 2 were classified as having Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome. In 52% (n = 11) of patients, a RASopathy has been molecularly confirmed. Mutations in PTPN11 and SOS1 genes were found in patients with diagnosis of NS and BRAF gene mutations in patients with CFC syndrome. As reported from other cohorts, mutations in exons 3 and 8 of the PTPN11 gene predominated in Tunisian NS patients. A very uncommon PTPN11 mutation c.5C>T (p.T2I), the functional consequences of which have so far remained unclear, was identified in one patient. As biased by the mode of recruitment, all patients included in this study had a congenital heart defect, with pulmonary valve stenosis being the most frequent one. Short stature and developmental abnormalities were present in mutation-positive cases. This is the first molecular study in patients from southern Tunisia with RASopathy diagnosis.	4
Activity-associated effect of LDL receptor missense variants located in the cysteine-rich repeats. || Familial hypercholesterolemia LDLR Ligand binding domain Mutation class defect Mutations || The LDL receptor (LDLR) is a Class I transmembrane protein critical for the clearance of cholesterol-containing lipoprotein particles. The N-terminal domain of the LDLR harbours the ligand-binding domain consisting of seven cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids each. Mutations in the LDLR binding domain may result in loss of receptor activity leading to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In this study the activity of six mutations located in the cysteine-rich repeats of the LDLR has been investigated. CHO-ldlA7 transfected cells with six different LDLR mutations have been used to analyse in vitro LDLR expression, lipoprotein binding and uptake. Immunoblotting of cell extracts, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy have been performed to determine the effects of these mutations. In silico analysis was also performed to predict the mutation effect. From the six mutations, p.Arg257Trp turned out to be a non-pathogenic LDLR variant whereas p.Cys116Arg, p.Asp168Asn, p.Asp172Asn, p.Arg300Gly and p.Asp301Gly were classified as binding-defective LDLR variants whose effect is not as severe as null allele mutations.	0
Mutation analysis of 272 Spanish families affected by autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa using a genotyping microarray. ||  || Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by progressive loss of vision. The aim of this study was to identify the causative mutations in 272 Spanish families using a genotyping microarray. 272 unrelated Spanish families, 107 with autosomal recessive RP (arRP) and 165 with sporadic RP (sRP), were studied using the APEX genotyping microarray. The families were also classified by clinical criteria: 86 juveniles and 186 typical RP families. Haplotype and sequence analysis were performed to identify the second mutated allele. At least one-gene variant was found in 14% and 16% of the juvenile and typical RP groups respectively. Further study identified four new mutations, providing both causative changes in 11% of the families. Retinol Dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12) was the most frequently mutated gene in the juvenile RP group, and Usher Syndrome 2A (USH2A) and Ceramide Kinase-Like (CERKL) were the most frequently mutated genes in the typical RP group. The only variant found in CERKL was p.Arg257Stop, the most frequent mutation. The genotyping microarray combined with segregation and sequence analysis allowed us to identify the causative mutations in 11% of the families. Due to the low number of characterized families, this approach should be used in tandem with other techniques.	4 2
Molecular analysis of Turkish Gaucher disease patients: identification of novel mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is the most frequent lysosomal glycolipid storage disorder due to autosomal recessive deficiency of acid beta-glucosidase and is characterized by the accumulation of glucocerebroside. In this work we carried out molecular analysis of the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) in 57 unrelated patients and the alleleic frequencies of gene mutations in Turkish patients are reported. The most prevalent are L444P and N370S accounting for 42% and 30% in our patients. We identified three novel genetic alterations: two missense changes S356F, L296V that are associated with the severe phenotype of type 1 GD. 303-305delCAC was identified in a homozygous state in one patient type 1 or type 3.	1 4
Molecular genetics of familial hypercholesterolaemia in Norway. ||  || To characterize mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene causing familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) amongst Norwegian patients. Molecular genetic analyses of the LDL receptor gene have been performed in patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH. A total of 742 probands have been studied. Of these, 476 had a diagnosis of definite FH. The rest had a diagnosis of possible FH. Twenty-three different mutations in the LDL receptor gene as well as the apolipoprotein B-3500 mutation have been found. Six of the mutations in the LDL receptor gene are novel mutations. A molecular genetic diagnosis was achieved in 295 of the probands with definite FH (62%) and in 317 probands total. Of the 317 probands, 3% carried the apolipoprotein B-3500 mutation. When family members were included, a total of 624 persons carried a mutation in the LDL receptor gene and 20 carried the apolipoprotein B-3500 mutation. Approximately 5% of Norwegian FH patients have been provided with a molecular genetic diagnosis. Our data suggest that molecular diagnosis of FH in Norway is feasible and should be implemented in clinical medicine.	4
Five new Gaucher disease mutations. ||  || DNA from 17 individuals with 20 unidentified alleles was subjected to single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and/or sequencing and 5 previously undescribed mutations have been identified: 245T, 259T, 635G, 914C del, and IVS10(+2). Two of these mutations, 914C del and IVS10(+2), are null, or "lethal" mutations. Because the other mutation each of these two patients carried was "mild", the phenotype was type I disease. In addition to the new mutations we describe, the second example of the rare 1448G mutation has been documented in one of the patients. This mutation is particularly interesting because in samples studied by restriction analysis with NciI it can readily be confused with the common 1448C mutation. Reexamination of 28 patients who had previously been diagnosed as carrying the 1448C mutation were confirmed to be 1448C.	1 4
Identifying recurrent mutations in cancer reveals widespread lineage diversity and mutational specificity. ||  || Mutational hotspots indicate selective pressure across a population of tumor samples, but their prevalence within and across cancer types is incompletely characterized. An approach to detect significantly mutated residues, rather than methods that identify recurrently mutated genes, may uncover new biologically and therapeutically relevant driver mutations. Here, we developed a statistical algorithm to identify recurrently mutated residues in tumor samples. We applied the algorithm to 11,119 human tumors, spanning 41 cancer types, and identified 470 somatic substitution hotspots in 275 genes. We find that half of all human tumors possess one or more mutational hotspots with widespread lineage-, position- and mutant allele-specific differences, many of which are likely functional. In total, 243 hotspots were novel and appeared to affect a broad spectrum of molecular function, including hotspots at paralogous residues of Ras-related small GTPases RAC1 and RRAS2. Redefining hotspots at mutant amino acid resolution will help elucidate the allele-specific differences in their function and could have important therapeutic implications.	4
Hypothyroidism in late-onset Pompe disease. || Acid α-glucosidase enzyme Glycogen Hypothyroidism Late-onset Pompe disease || In Pompe disease, a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase enzyme activity leads to pathologic accumulation of glycogen in tissues. Phenotype heterogeneity in Pompe includes an infantile form and late-onset forms (juvenile- and adult-onset forms). Symptoms common to all phenotypes include progressive muscle weakness and worsening respiratory function. Patients with late-onset forms of Pompe disease commonly complain of chronic fatigue and generalized muscle weakness prior to being diagnosed with Pompe disease, and this may lead to consideration of hypothyroidism in the differential diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hypothyroidism in the adult-onset form of Pompe disease. Electronic chart review was performed at the Advanced Therapies Clinic at the University of Minnesota Medical Center (UMMC) to identify patients with late-onset Pompe disease. The identified charts were reviewed for a co-diagnosis of hypothyroidism. A query was made to the clinical data repository at UMMC searching diagnosis ICD9 code 244.9 (hypothyroidism not otherwise specified) and/or presence of levothyroxine from 2011 to 2014 in patients 18 years of age and older. The clinical data repository found a prevalence of hypothyroidism of 3.15% (56,072 of 1,782,720 patients) in the adult patient population at UMMC. Ten adult patients with Pompe disease were identified, five with the diagnosis of hypothyroidism (50%, 95% CI: 23.7, 76.3, p < 0.001 compared with the general UMMC adult population). Hypothyroidism was found at a higher prevalence in patients with late-onset Pompe disease compared to the general adult population at UMMC. Studies in larger populations of patients with Pompe disease would be needed to confirm an association of Pompe disease and hypothyroidism. Challenges include finding an adequate sample size, due the rarity of Pompe disease.	1
Homozygosity for multiple contiguous single-nucleotide polymorphisms as an indicator of large heterozygous deletions: identification of a novel heterozygous 8-kb intragenic deletion (IVS7-19 to IVS15-17) in a patient with glycogen storage disease type II. ||  || Current methods for detection of mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis frequently are not able to detect heterozygous large deletions. We report the successful use of a novel approach to identify such deletions, based on detection of apparent homozygosity of contiguous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The sequence analysis of genomic DNA PCR products containing all coding exons and flanking introns identified only a single heterozygous mutation (IVS18+2t-->a) in a patient with classic infantile-onset autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII). Apparent homozygosity for multiple contiguous SNPs detected by this sequencing suggested presence of a large deletion as the second mutation; primers flanking the region of homozygous SNPs permitted identification and characterization by PCR of a large genomic deletion (8.26 kb) extending from IVS7 to IVS15. The data clearly demonstrate the utility of SNPs as markers for large deletions in autosomal recessive diseases when only a single mutation is found, thus complementing currently standard DNA PCR sequence methods for identifying the molecular basis of disease.	1 3
Frequency of low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations in patients with a clinical diagnosis of familial combined hyperlipidemia in a clinical setting. ||  || The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and apolipoprotein B (APOB) genes in consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) in a nonresearch setting. The lipid phenotype frequently overlaps in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and FCH. Detection of causative mutations in LDLR or APOB provides an unequivocal diagnosis of FH, but such genetic testing has not been systematically performed in FCH. We used Lipochip (Progenika, Derio, Spain), a microarray that includes 203 causative mutations in LDLR and 4 APOB defects, to investigate 143 unrelated FCH patients. Mutations of LDLR were found in 28 patients (overall prevalence, 19.6%). No APOB defects were found. Compared with patients who had a normal LDLR gene, patients with mutations had lower waist circumference (p = 0.02); significantly (p < 0.005) higher total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoB; nonsignificantly (p = 0.063) lower triglycerides; and a lower frequency of diabetes mellitus (22% vs. 0%, respectively; p = 0.002). Total cholesterol and apoB levels showed the best receiver-operator characteristics curves in the prediction of LDLR mutations, with areas under the curve (95% CI: of 0.750 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.647 to 0.853) and 0.744 (95% CI: 0.636 to 0.851), respectively. Total cholesterol of 335 mg/dl and apoB of 185 mg/dl were the best thresholds for diagnosis of LDLR mutations. Screening for LDLR defects is advisable for patients with a clinical diagnosis of FCH showing high total cholesterol or apoB levels. Diagnostic criteria for FH should not exclude patients whose personal and familial lipid values appear to fit the clinical criteria of FCH.	4
Perinatal lethal phenotype with generalized ichthyosis in a type 2 Gaucher disease patient with the [L444P;E326K]/P182L genotype: effect of the E326K change in neonatal and classic forms of the disease. ||  || Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms. The perinatal lethal form is very rare and is considered a distinct form of classic type 2 Gaucher disease. Prominent features of the severe perinatal form are hepatosplenomegaly variable, associated with hydrops fetalis and ichthyosis. Here, we describe a child who presented generalized ichthyosis and died at 25 days of age. Genotype analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for the complex allele [L444P;E326K] and mutation P182L, described for the first time in this patient. Mutations E326K and L444P were on the same chromosome. Expression studies of mutant glucocerebrosidases showed that the double mutant allele had lower activity, 8.5% of wild type, in contrast to the activity of individual E326K and L444P mutant enzymes, 42.7% and 14.1%, respectively. The P182L mutant enzyme showed no glucocerebrosidase activity. A revision of the genotypes identified in a series of Spanish patients with type 2 Gaucher disease showed that the complex allele [L444P;E326K] accounted for 19.2% of patient alleles and that homozygosity for this allele or its heterozygosity with mutation L444P, or another severe mutation such as P182L, was associated with the perinatal lethal presentation of the disease. In contrast, the [L444P;E326K] allele was not detected in patients with classic type 2 diagnosed when several months old. The high frequency of the E326K substitution observed in patients with type 2 as compared to the general population (0.5%) suggests that this change may have a modulating negative effect on the clinical condition of these Gaucher disease patients when present in combination with mutation L444P. The relatively high prevalence of the double mutant allele in Spanish patients prompted us to perform a haplotype analysis, using four polymorphic markers, which suggest a common origin for this allele. During the mutational analysis of the series of type 2 patients, a novel mutation, I260T (c.896T>C), was identified.	1
Mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene of familial hypercholesterolemic patients detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct sequencing. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) results from mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. We applied denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to screen for sequence variations in the coding and splice site consensus sequences of the LDLR gene. For amplification of each exon by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), optimal pairs of primers were designed by the MELT 87 computer algorithm. To increase the sensitivity, an artificial GC-clamp was included in either the 5'- or the 3'-end of each fragment. DGGE screening of 32 apparently unrelated heterozygous FH patients revealed 16 unique different aberrant DGGE patterns in 27 patients, while in a group of 32 normal subjects none of these DGGE patterns could be observed, suggesting that the aberrant patterns represent disease-causing mutations. Interestingly, 16 out of 27 patients showed an aberrant DGGE pattern in the part of the gene encoding the ligand binding domain (exons 2-6). Direct solid-phase sequencing of the corresponding exon-specific PCR products revealed the nature of the mutations: three nonsense, four splicing, two frameshift, one silent, and six missense mutations. Six of the mutations have been previously reported, while ten are novel mutations. These results indicate that DGGE provides a reliable method for the detection of the presence of point mutations in the LDLR gene of FH patients, thereby facilitating the introduction of rapid DNA diagnosis for this common and genetically heterogeneous disorder.	4
Assessment of carotid atherosclerosis in normocholesterolemic individuals with proven mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor or apolipoprotein B genes. ||  || Genetic cascade screening for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) revealed that 15% of individuals given this diagnosis do not exhibit elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. We assessed whether cardiovascular risk for these individuals differs from that of hypercholesterolemic FH heterozygotes and unaffected relatives. Individuals aged 18 to 55 years were recruited within 18 months after genetic screening. Three groups were studied: subjects given a molecular diagnosis of FH and with LDL-C levels at genetic screening below the 75th percentile (FH-low), subjects with FH and an LDL-C level above the 90th percentile (FH-high), and subjects without FH (no-FH). We measured carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) by ultrasonography. Differences in carotid IMT among the groups were assessed using multivariate linear regression analyses. Mean carotid IMT of 114 subjects in the FH-low group (0.623 mm; 95% CI, 0.609 to 0.638 mm) was significantly smaller than that of 162 subjects in the FH-high group (0.664 mm; 95% CI, 0.648 to 0.679 mm; P<0.001) and did not significantly differ from the mean carotid IMT in 145 subjects in the no-FH group (0.628 mm; 95% CI, 0.613 to 0.642 mm; P=0.67). Our findings suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with FH to a large extent is related to LDL-C levels and not to the presence of a mutation per se. Consequently, this study cautiously suggests that individuals with an FH genotype without expression of hypercholesterolemia may not require a pharmaceutical intervention that is as aggressive as the standard for subjects with FH.	4
Mutational analysis of the LDLR gene in a cohort of Colombian families with familial hypercholesterolemia. || Cardiovascular risk Colombia Familial hypercholesterolemia Low-density lipoprotein receptor gene || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by elevated serum cholesterol levels due to high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. FH is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder and one of the most common dominant hereditary diseases in the world. However, the frequency of mutations in Colombia is unknown. The purpose of this preliminary study was to identify mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene in a Colombian population with FH. The study included 24 families with clinical diagnosis of sure/probable FH. The 18 exons of the LDLR were sequenced by Sanger method. Among 18 variants identified, 3 were known pathogenic mutations and were identified in nine individuals in five unrelated families. Five affected individuals were heterozygous for one mutation each. They were the p.W4X in two, the p.D139G in two and the p.G396D in one. Two affected individuals were homozygous for p.G396D. The variant c.1187-1G > T, which has uncertain significance in FH pathogenesis, was present in all the individuals with the p.D139G mutation. In total, 18 variants were identified, of which 14 correspond to known nonpathogenic variants. Three pathogenic variants were identified in the LDLR. No pathological mutations were identified in the LDLR in 79% of the study population.	4 2
Structural and functional analysis of APOA5 mutations identified in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. ||  || During the diagnosis of three unrelated patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, three APOA5 mutations [p.(Ser232_Leu235)del, p.Leu253Pro, and p.Asp332ValfsX4] were found without evidence of concomitant LPL, APOC2, or GPIHBP1 mutations. The molecular mechanisms by which APOA5 mutations result in severe hypertriglyceridemia remain poorly understood, and the functional impairment/s induced by these specific mutations was not obvious. Therefore, we performed a thorough structural and functional analysis that included follow-up of patients and their closest relatives, measurement of apoA-V serum concentrations, and sequencing of the APOA5 gene in 200 nonhyperlipidemic controls. Further, we cloned, overexpressed, and purified both wild-type and mutant apoA-V variants and characterized their capacity to activate LPL. The interactions of recombinant wild-type and mutated apoA-V variants with liposomes of different composition, heparin, LRP1, sortilin, and SorLA/LR11 were also analyzed. Finally, to explore the possible structural consequences of these mutations, we developed a three-dimensional model of full-length, lipid-free human apoA-V. A complex, wide array of impairments was found in each of the three mutants, suggesting that the specific residues affected are critical structural determinants for apoA-V function in lipoprotein metabolism and, therefore, that these APOA5 mutations are a direct cause of hypertriglyceridemia.	4
Glucosylceramide synthase inhibition alleviates aberrations in synucleinopathy models. || GBA mutations Gaucher disease Lewy body dementia Parkinson’s disease glucosylceramide synthase || Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (<i>GBA</i>) confer a heightened risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, resulting in a lower age of onset and exacerbating disease progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which mutations in <i>GBA</i> increase PD risk and accelerate its progression remain unclear. Here, we investigated the merits of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibition as a potential treatment for synucleinopathies. Two murine models of synucleinopathy (a Gaucher-related synucleinopathy model, <i>Gba</i><sup> <i>D409V/D409V</i> </sup> and a A53T-α-synuclein overexpressing model harboring wild-type alleles of <i>GBA</i>, <i>A53T-SNCA</i> mouse model) were exposed to a brain-penetrant GCS inhibitor, GZ667161. Treatment of <i>Gba</i><sup> <i>D409V/D409V</i> </sup> mice with the GCS inhibitor reduced levels of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine in the central nervous system (CNS), demonstrating target engagement. Remarkably, treatment with GZ667161 slowed the accumulation of hippocampal aggregates of α-synuclein, ubiquitin, and tau, and improved the associated memory deficits. Similarly, prolonged treatment of <i>A53T-SNCA</i> mice with GZ667161 reduced membrane-associated α-synuclein in the CNS and ameliorated cognitive deficits. The data support the contention that prolonged antagonism of GCS in the CNS can affect α-synuclein processing and improve behavioral outcomes. Hence, inhibition of GCS represents a disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for <i>GBA</i>-related synucleinopathies and conceivably for certain forms of sporadic disease.	0
Alterations in bile acid synthesis in carriers of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α mutations. || cholesterol metabolism diabetes || Heterozygous mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) cause maturity onset diabetes of the young 3 (MODY3), an autosomal dominant form of diabetes. Deficiency of HNF1α in mice results in diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and increased bile acid (BA) and cholesterol synthesis. Little is known about alterations in lipid metabolism in patients with MODY3. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with MODY3 have altered cholesterol and BA synthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption. A secondary aim was to investigate the effects of HNF1α mutations on the transcriptional regulation of BA metabolism. Plasma biomarkers of BA and cholesterol synthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption were measured in patients with MODY3 (n = 19) and in matched healthy control subjects (n = 15). Cotransfection experiments were performed with several promoters involved in BA metabolism along with expression vectors carrying the mutations found in these patients. Plasma analysis showed higher levels of BA synthesis in patients with MODY3. No differences were observed in cholesterol synthesis or intestinal cholesterol absorption. Cotransfection experiments showed that one of the mutations (P379A) increased the induction of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase promoter compared with HNF1α, without further differences in other studied promoters. By contrast, the other four mutations (L107I, T260M, P291fsinsC and R131Q) reduced the induction of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) promoter, which was followed by reduced repression of the small heterodimer partner promoter. In addition, these mutations also reduced the induction of the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter promoter. BA synthesis is increased in patients with MODY3 compared with control subjects. Mutations in HNF1α affect promoters involved in BA metabolism.	4 0
GJB2 Mutation Spectrum and Genotype-Phenotype Correlation in 1067 Han Chinese Subjects with Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss. ||  || Mutations in Gap Junction Beta 2 (GJB2) have been reported to be a major cause of non-syndromic hearing loss in many populations worldwide. The spectrums and frequencies of GJB2 variants vary substantially among different ethnic groups, and the genotypes among these populations remain poorly understood. In the present study, we carried out a systematic and extended mutational screening of GJB2 gene in 1067 Han Chinese subjects with non-syndromic hearing loss, and the resultant GJB2 variants were evaluated by phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis. A total of 25 (23 known and 2 novel) GJB2 variants were identified, including 6 frameshift mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, 16 missense mutations and 2 silent mutations. In this cohort, c.235delC is the most frequently observed pathogenic mutation. The phylogenetic, structural and bioinformatic analysis showed that 2 novel variants c.127G>T (p.V43L), c.293G>C (p.R98P) and 2 known variants c. 107T>C (p.L36P) and c.187G>T (p.V63L) are localized at highly conserved amino acids. In addition, these 4 mutations are absent in 203 healthy individuals, therefore, they are probably the most likely candidate pathogenic mutations. In addition, 66 (24 novel and 42 known) genotypes were identified, including 6 homozygotes, 20 compound heterozygotes, 18 single heterozygotes, 21 genotypes harboring only polymorphism(s) and the wild type genotype. Among these, 153 (14.34%) subjects were homozygous for pathogenic mutations, 63 (5.91%) were compound heterozygotes, and 157 (14.71%) carried single heterozygous mutation. Furthermore, 65.28% (141/216) of these cases with two pathogenic mutations exhibited profound hearing loss. These data suggested that mutations in GJB2 gene are responsible for approximately 34.96% of non-syndromic hearing loss in Han Chinese population from Zhejiang Province in eastern China. In addition, our results also strongly supported the idea that other factors such as alterations in regulatory regions, additional genes, and environmental factors may contribute to the clinical manifestation of deafness.	1
Improved genetic testing for monogenic diabetes using targeted next-generation sequencing. ||  || Current genetic tests for diagnosing monogenic diabetes rely on selection of the appropriate gene for analysis according to the patient's phenotype. Next-generation sequencing enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple genes in a single test. Our aim was to develop a targeted next-generation sequencing assay to detect mutations in all known MODY and neonatal diabetes genes. We selected 29 genes in which mutations have been reported to cause neonatal diabetes, MODY, maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) or familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD). An exon-capture assay was designed to include coding regions and splice sites. A total of 114 patient samples were tested--32 with known mutations and 82 previously tested for MODY (n = 33) or neonatal diabetes (n = 49) but in whom a mutation had not been found. Sequence data were analysed for the presence of base substitutions, small insertions or deletions (indels) and exonic deletions or duplications. In the 32 positive controls we detected all previously identified variants (34 mutations and 36 polymorphisms), including 55 base substitutions, ten small insertions or deletions and five partial/whole gene deletions/duplications. Previously unidentified mutations were found in five patients with MODY (15%) and nine with neonatal diabetes (18%). Most of these patients (12/14) had mutations in genes that had not previously been tested. Our novel targeted next-generation sequencing assay provides a highly sensitive method for simultaneous analysis of all monogenic diabetes genes. This single test can detect mutations previously identified by Sanger sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification dosage analysis. The increased number of genes tested led to a higher mutation detection rate.	4
The genetic spectrum of familial hypercholesterolemia in Pakistan. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the genes coding for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) or apo-lipoprotein B-100 (APOB). The aim of the present work was to determine the genetic basis of dyslipidemia in 11 unrelated Pakistani families. High resolution melting (HRM), sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Probands were screened for the promoter and all coding regions, including intron/exon boundaries, of LDLR and PCSK9 and part of exon 26 of APOB including p.(R3527Q). Two families were identified with previously unreported LDLR mutations (c.1019_1020delinsTG, p.(C340L) and c.1634G>A, p.(G545E)). Both probands had tendon xanthomas or xanthelasma and/or a history of cardiovascular disease. Co-segregation with hypercholesterolemia was demonstrated in both families. In silico studies predicted these variations to be damaging. In two families, novel PCSK9 variations were identified (exon2; c.314G>A, p.(R105Q) and exon3; c.464C>T, p.(P155L)). In silico studies suggested both were likely to be damaging, and family members carrying the p.(105Q) allele had lower total cholesterol levels, suggesting this is a loss-of-function mutation. For c.464C>T p.(P155L) the small number of relatives available precluded any strong inference. This report brings to seven the number of different LDLR mutations reported in FH patients from Pakistan and, as expected in this heterogeneous population, no common LDLR mutation has been identified.	4 0 2
Clinical exome sequencing for fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities and a suspected Mendelian disorder. || Exome sequencing Fetal structural abnormalities Mendelian disease Prenatal Single-gene disorder || Exome sequencing is now being incorporated into clinical care for pediatric and adult populations, but its integration into prenatal diagnosis has been more limited. One reason for this is the paucity of information about the clinical utility of exome sequencing in the prenatal setting. We retrospectively reviewed indications, results, time to results (turnaround time, TAT), and impact of exome results for 146 consecutive "fetal exomes" performed in a clinical diagnostic laboratory between March 2012 and November 2017. We define a fetal exome as one performed on a sample obtained from a fetus or a product of conception with at least one structural anomaly detected by prenatal imaging or autopsy. Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact test. Prenatal exome yielded an overall molecular diagnostic rate of 32% (n = 46/146). Of the 46 molecular diagnoses, 50% were autosomal dominant disorders (n = 23/46), 41% were autosomal recessive disorders (n = 19/46), and 9% were X-linked disorders (n = 4/46). The molecular diagnostic rate was highest for fetuses with anomalies affecting multiple organ systems and for fetuses with craniofacial anomalies. Out of 146 cases, a prenatal trio exome option designed for ongoing pregnancies was performed on 62 fetal specimens, resulting in a diagnostic yield of 35% with an average TAT of 14 days for initial reporting (excluding tissue culture time). The molecular diagnoses led to refined recurrence risk estimates, altered medical management, and informed reproductive planning for families. Exome sequencing is a useful diagnostic tool when fetal structural anomalies suggest a genetic etiology, but other standard prenatal genetic tests did not provide a diagnosis.	4
Identification and functional analysis of GCK gene mutations in 12 Chinese families with hyperglycemia. || Enzyme kinetics Glucokinase Maturity-onset diabetes of the young || To investigate the clinical and genetic characteristics of Chinese patients with a phenotype consistent with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 and explore the pathogenic mechanism of their hyperglycemia. We studied 12 probands and their extended families referred to our center for screening mutations in the glucokinase gene (GCK). Clinical data were collected and genetic analysis was carried out. The recombinant wild-type and mutant glucokinase were generated in Escherichia coli. The kinetic parameters and thermal stability of the enzymes were determined in vitro. In the 12 families, 11 GCK mutations (R43C, T168A, K169N, R191W, Y215X, E221K, M235T, R250H, W257X, G261R and A379E) and one variant of uncertain significance (R275H) were identified. R191W was detected in two unrelated families. Of the 11 GCK mutations, three mutations (c.507G>C, K169N; c.645C>A, Y215X; c.771G>A, W257X; NM_000162.3, NP_000153.1) are novel. Basic kinetics analysis explained the pathogenicity of the five mutants (R43C, K169N, R191W, E221K and A379E), which showed reduced enzyme activity with relative activity indexes between ~0.001 and 0.5 compared with the wild-type (1.0). In addition, the thermal stabilities of these five mutants were also decreased to varying degrees. However, for R250H and R275H, there was no significant difference in the enzyme activity and thermal stability between the mutants and the wild type. We have identified 11 GCK mutations and one variant of uncertain significance in 12 Chinese families with hyperglycemia. For five GCK mutations (R43C, K169N, R191W, E221K and A379E), the changes in enzyme kinetics and thermostability might be the pathogenic mechanisms by which mutations cause hyperglycemia.	4 0 2
Heterogeneity of mutations in the acid beta-glucosidase gene of Gaucher disease patients. ||  || Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease. Gaucher disease has marked phenotypic variation and molecular heterogeneity, and several simple and complex alleles of the acid beta-glucosidase gene have been identified as causal to this disease. Certain combinations of alleles have been shown to correlate well with the severity of the disease, but many Gaucher disease patients exist whose disease is not explained by any of the published mutations. This study was undertaken to identify mutant alleles in such incompletely characterized Gaucher disease, in an attempt to find further correlations between clinical phenotype and the presence of acid beta-glucosidase alleles. RNA was isolated from Gaucher cell lines and converted to cDNA, the cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned, and several clones for each allele were sequenced. Several new singly mutated and multiply mutated alleles were identified, and sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify the presence of these mutations in the genome of these patients. All newly identified mutations occurred only rarely in the Gaucher disease population, making it difficult to determine whether inheritance of a particular combination of alleles always correlates with the clinical manifestations seen in the test patients. Three of the newly described alleles were single missense mutations in exon 8, one was a single missense mutation in exon 5, and the fifth was a complex allele, comprising a series of different point mutations scattered throughout exons 5 and 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1 4
Phenotypic variability in 4 homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia siblings compound heterozygous for LDLR mutations. || APOB gene Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia In-frame deletion LDL cholesterol LDLR gene Missense mutations || Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare clinical phenotype with a variable expression, which is characterized by extremely elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL), tendon and skin xanthomas, and a progressive atherosclerosis. In 95% of patients, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is due to mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene, which abolish (receptor-negative) or greatly reduce (receptor-defective) LDLR function. The objective of the study was the molecular and phenotypic characterization of 4 siblings with severe hypercholesterolemia. The major LDL-related genes (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, ANGPTL3, APOE, and APOC3) were sequenced. LDLR messenger RNA, isolated from leukocytes, was reverse transcribed and sequenced. The index cases were 24-year-old identical twin sisters with long-standing tendon xanthomas and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C ∼10 mmol/L) but no coronary heart disease. They were carriers of 2 LDLR mutations: (1) a previously reported mutation [p.(G335S)] inherited from the mother who had LDL-C level within normal range; (2) a novel 24 bp deletion in exon 8/intron 8 junction inherited from the hypercholesterolemic (LDL-C 6.1 mmol/L) father. The deletion allele encodes an messenger RNA with a partial deletion of exon 8, whose translation product has an in-frame deletion of 17 amino acids [p.(Glu380_Gly396del)]. Family screening revealed that the 2 siblings of the twin sisters were also compound heterozygotes but had much lower LDL-C levels (8.2 and 7.1 mmol/L). The sequence of potential modifying genes showed that the 2 siblings and the mother of the twin sisters were heterozygous for a rare missense variant of apoB [p.(S2429T)], which might have an LDL-lowering effect. We report a rare event of 4 siblings found to be compound heterozygotes for 2 LDLR gene mutations but showing a different phenotype severity. The less severely affected siblings were carriers of a rare apoB missense variant.	4 2
Genetic analysis of familial hypercholesterolaemia in Western Australia. ||  || To determine the spectrum of mutations associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and their detection rate in the FH Western Australia (FHWA) Program. Mutation testing of the LDLR gene, plus select regions in APOB and PCSK9, was performed in the first 343 patients considered to be phenotypic index cases of FH and classified on the basis of the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria (DLCNC) score as "possible", "probable", or "definite" FH. Overall, 86 different pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) mutations were identified in 129 patients, including four compound heterozygotes manifesting a more severe clinical phenotype. Fourteen of these mutations were novel and twelve (9.6%) were large deletions/duplications of the LDLR. The most common mutations were the familial defective apoB-100 mutation APOB p.Arg3527Gln (7.2%) and an LDLR intron 3 splice site mutation c.313 + 1G > A (4.8%). While 70% of 'definite' FH patients were found to carry a mutation, only 29% of 'probable' and 11% of 'possible' FH patients were mutation-positive. This information provides a useful DNA database on which to base ongoing cascade screening for FH and future research into the genetic aetiology of FH in Western Australia. These findings suggest genetic testing should be prioritised to those with high DLCNC scores and offers a cost-effective family screening method from FH index cases, leading to detection of other previously undiagnosed and younger family members, enabling early instigation of intervention and preventative measures for premature coronary heart disease.	4
Prevalence and clinical features of hearing loss patients with CDH23 mutations: a large cohort study. ||  || Screening for gene mutations in CDH23, which has many exons, has lagged even though it is likely to be an important cause for hearing loss patients. To assess the importance of CDH23 mutations in non-syndromic hearing loss, two-step screening was applied and clinical characteristics of the patients with CDH23 mutations were examined in this study. As a first screening, we performed Sanger sequencing using 304 probands compatible with recessive inheritance to find the pathologic mutations. Twenty-six possible mutations were detected to be pathologic in the first screening. For the second screening, using the probes for these 26 mutations, a large cohort of probands (n = 1396) was screened using Taqman amplification-based mutation analysis followed by Sanger sequencing. The hearing loss in a total of 52 families (10 homozygous, 13 compound heterogygous, and 29 heterozygous) was found to be caused by the CDH23 mutations. The majority of the patients showed congenital, high frequency involved, progressive hearing loss. Interestingly, some particular mutations cause late onset moderate hearing loss. The present study is the first to demonstrate the prevalence of CDH23 mutations among non-syndromic hearing loss patients and indicated that mutations of the CDH23 gene are an important cause of non-syndromic hearing loss.	1
Diabetes models by screen for hyperglycemia in phenotype-driven ENU mouse mutagenesis projects. ||  || More than 150 million people suffer from diabetes mellitus worldwide, and this number is expected to rise substantially within the next decades. Despite its high prevalence, the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus is not completely understood. Therefore, appropriate experimental models are essential tools to gain more insight into the genetics and pathogenesis of the disease. Here, we describe the current efforts to establish novel diabetes models derived from unbiased, phenotype-driven, large-scale N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mouse mutagenesis projects started a decade ago using hyperglycemia as a high-throughput screen parameter. Mouse lines were established according to their hyperglycemia phenotype over several generations, thereby revealing a mutation as cause for the aberrant phenotype. Chromosomal assignment of the causative mutation and subsequent candidate gene analysis led to the detection of the mutations that resulted in novel alleles of genes already known to be involved in glucose homeostasis, like glucokinase, insulin 2, and insulin receptor. Additional ENU-induced hyperglycemia lines are under genetic analysis. Improvements in screen for diabetic animals are implemented to detect more subtle phenotypes. Moreover, diet challenge assays are being employed to uncover interactions between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The new mouse mutants recovered in phenotype-driven ENU mouse mutagenesis projects complement the available models generated by targeted mutagenesis of candidate genes, all together providing the large resource of models required for a systematic dissection of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.	0
Characterization of ABCC8 and KCNJ11 gene mutations and phenotypes in Korean patients with congenital hyperinsulinism. ||  || Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is characterized by persistent hypoglycemia due to the inappropriate insulin secretion. Inactivating mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, which encode the sulfonylurea receptor 1 and Kir6.2 subunits of the ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channel in pancreatic β-cell, are the most common cause of CHI. We studied the genetic etiology and phenotypes of CHI in Korean patients. ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutational analysis was performed in 17 patients with CHI. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to identify phenotypes. Mutations (12 ABCC8 and three KCNJ11) were identified in 82% (14/17) of patients. Of these, nine ABCC8 mutations (E100X, W430X, c.1630+1G>C, D813N, Q923X, E1087_A1094delinsDKSDT, Q1134H, H1135W, and E1209Rfs) and one KCNJ11 mutation (W91X) were novel. Of the 14 patients, four had confirming recessively inherited CHI. The remaining ten patients had single heterozygous mutations. The majority (12/17) of patients were medically responsive. Of the five diazoxide-responsive patients, four had an ABCC8 mutation. The five patients unresponsive to medical management and one diazoxide-responsive patient underwent pancreatectomy and had diffuse histology. Of the operated six patients, two had recessively inherited mutations; three patients had a single heterozygous mutation (one maternally and two paternally inherited); and one patient had no identifiable K(ATP) channel mutation. This is the first study to report genotype and phenotype correlations among Korean patients with CHI. Mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 are the most common causes of CHI in Korean patients. Similar to other studies, there is marked genetic heterogeneity and no clear genotype-phenotype correlation.	1 4
Efficacy and safety of long-term, continuous subcutaneous octreotide infusion for patients with different subtypes of KATP-channel hyperinsulinism. ||  || To evaluate the efficacy of long-term, continuous, subcutaneous octreotide infusion for congenital hyperinsulinism caused by mutations in the KATP-channel genes, KCNJ11 and ABCC8. Fifteen Japanese patients with diazoxide-unresponsive, KATP-channel hyperinsulinism. Molecular diagnoses were made by sequencing and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis. In patients with paternally inherited, monoallelic mutations, 18F-DOPA PET scans were performed to determine the location of the lesion. The patients were treated with continuous, subcutaneous octreotide infusion at a dosage of up to 25 μg/kg/day, using an insulin pump to maintain blood glucose levels higher than 3.33 mmol/l. Additional treatments (IV glucose, glucagon or enteral feeding) were administered as needed. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed in patients who received octreotide for 4 months to 5.9 years. Three patients had biallelic mutations, and 12 had monoallelic, paternally inherited mutations. Four patients with monoallelic mutations showed diffuse 18F-DOPA uptake, whereas seven patients showed focal uptake. Octreotide was effective in all the patients. The patients with biallelic mutations required a higher dosage (17-25 μg/kg/day), and two patients required additional treatments. By contrast, the patients with monoallelic mutations required a lower dosage (0.5-21 μg/kg/day) irrespective of the PET results and mostly without additional treatments. Treatment was discontinued in three patients at 2.5, 3.3 and 5.9 years of age, without psychomotor delay. Except for growth deceleration at a higher dosage, no significant adverse effects were noted. Long-term, continuous, subcutaneous octreotide infusion is a feasible alternative to surgery especially for patients with monoallelic KATP-channel mutations.	4
Multiple giant cell lesions in patients with Noonan syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. ||  || Noonan syndrome (NS) and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS) are related developmental disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding various components of the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade. NS is associated with mutations in the genes PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, or KRAS, whereas CFCS can be caused by mutations in BRAF, MEK1, MEK2, or KRAS. The NS phenotype is rarely accompanied by multiple giant cell lesions (MGCL) of the jaw (Noonan-like/MGCL syndrome (NL/MGCLS)). PTPN11 mutations are the only genetic abnormalities reported so far in some patients with NL/MGCLS and in one individual with LEOPARD syndrome and MGCL. In a cohort of 75 NS patients previously tested negative for mutations in PTPN11 and KRAS, we detected SOS1 mutations in 11 individuals, four of whom had MGCL. To explore further the relevance of aberrant RAS-MAPK signaling in syndromic MGCL, we analyzed the established genes causing CFCS in three subjects with MGCL associated with a phenotype fitting CFCS. Mutations in BRAF or MEK1 were identified in these patients. All mutations detected in these seven patients with syndromic MGCL had previously been described in NS or CFCS without apparent MGCL. This study demonstrates that MGCL may occur in NS and CFCS with various underlying genetic alterations and no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation. This suggests that dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK pathway represents the common and basic molecular event predisposing to giant cell lesion formation in patients with NS and CFCS rather than specific mutation effects.	4
Somatic mosaic activating mutations in PIK3CA cause CLOVES syndrome. ||  || Congenital lipomatous overgrowth with vascular, epidermal, and skeletal anomalies (CLOVES) is a sporadically occurring, nonhereditary disorder characterized by asymmetric somatic hypertrophy and anomalies in multiple organs. We hypothesized that CLOVES syndrome would be caused by a somatic mutation arising during early embryonic development. Therefore, we employed massively parallel sequencing to search for somatic mosaic mutations in fresh, frozen, or fixed archival tissue from six affected individuals. We identified mutations in PIK3CA in all six individuals, and mutant allele frequencies ranged from 3% to 30% in affected tissue from multiple embryonic lineages. Interestingly, these same mutations have been identified in cancer cells, in which they increase phosphoinositide-3-kinase activity. We conclude that CLOVES is caused by postzygotic activating mutations in PIK3CA. The application of similar sequencing strategies will probably identify additional genetic causes for sporadically occurring, nonheritable malformations.	4
Germline and somatic mutations in the <i>MTOR</i> gene in focal cortical dysplasia and epilepsy. ||  || To assess the prevalence of somatic <i>MTOR</i> mutations in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and of germline <i>MTOR</i> mutations in a broad range of epilepsies. We collected 20 blood-brain paired samples from patients with FCD and searched for somatic variants using deep-targeted gene panel sequencing. Germline mutations in <i>MTOR</i> were assessed in a French research cohort of 93 probands with focal epilepsies and in a diagnostic Danish cohort of 245 patients with a broad range of epilepsies. Data sharing among collaborators allowed us to ascertain additional germline variants in <i>MTOR</i>. We detected recurrent somatic variants (p.Ser2215Phe, p.Ser2215Tyr, and p.Leu1460Pro) in the <i>MTOR</i> gene in 37% of participants with FCD II and showed histologic evidence for activation of the mTORC1 signaling cascade in brain tissue. We further identified 5 novel de novo germline missense <i>MTOR</i> variants in 6 individuals with a variable phenotype from focal, and less frequently generalized, epilepsies without brain malformations, to macrocephaly, with or without moderate intellectual disability. In addition, an inherited variant was found in a mother-daughter pair with nonlesional autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Our data illustrate the increasingly important role of somatic mutations of the <i>MTOR</i> gene in FCD and germline mutations in the pathogenesis of focal epilepsy syndromes with and without brain malformation or macrocephaly.	4
NGS testing for cardiomyopathy: Utility of adding RASopathy-associated genes. || BRAF Noonan syndrome PTPN11 RAF1 gain RASopathy SOS1 cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) || RASopathies include a group of syndromes caused by pathogenic germline variants in RAS-MAPK pathway genes and typically present with facial dysmorphology, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal anomalies. Recently, variants in RASopathy-associated genes have been reported in individuals with apparently nonsyndromic cardiomyopathy, suggesting that subtle features may be overlooked. To determine the utility and burden of adding RASopathy-associated genes to cardiomyopathy panels, we tested 11 RASopathy-associated genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS), including NGS-based copy number variant assessment, in 1,111 individuals referred for genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Disease-causing variants were identified in 0.6% (four of 692) of individuals with HCM, including three missense variants in the PTPN11, SOS1, and BRAF genes. Overall, 36 variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) were identified, averaging ∼3VUSs/100 cases. This study demonstrates that adding a subset of the RASopathy-associated genes to cardiomyopathy panels will increase clinical diagnoses without significantly increasing the number of VUSs/case.	4
De novo germline and postzygotic mutations in AKT3, PIK3R2 and PIK3CA cause a spectrum of related megalencephaly syndromes. ||  || Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndromes are sporadic overgrowth disorders associated with markedly enlarged brain size and other recognizable features. We performed exome sequencing in 3 families with MCAP or MPPH, and our initial observations were confirmed in exomes from 7 individuals with MCAP and 174 control individuals, as well as in 40 additional subjects with megalencephaly, using a combination of Sanger sequencing, restriction enzyme assays and targeted deep sequencing. We identified de novo germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. These include 2 mutations in AKT3, 1 recurrent mutation in PIK3R2 in 11 unrelated families with MPPH and 15 mostly postzygotic mutations in PIK3CA in 23 individuals with MCAP and 1 with MPPH. Our data highlight the central role of PI3K-AKT signaling in vascular, limb and brain development and emphasize the power of massively parallel sequencing in a challenging context of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity combined with postzygotic mosaicism.	4 0
Expression of human Gaucher disease gene GBA generates neurodevelopmental defects and ER stress in Drosophila eye. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common of the lysosomal storage disorders and is caused by defects in the GBA gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GlcCerase). The accumulation of its substrate, glucocylceramide (GlcCer) is considered the main cause of GD. We found here that the expression of human mutated GlcCerase gene (hGBA) that is associated with neuronopathy in GD patients causes neurodevelopmental defects in Drosophila eyes. The data indicate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was elevated in Drosophila eye carrying mutated hGBAs by using of the ER stress markers dXBP1 and dBiP. We also found that Ambroxol, a potential pharmacological chaperone for mutated hGBAs, can alleviate the neuronopathic phenotype through reducing ER stress. We demonstrate a novel mechanism of neurodevelopmental defects mediated by ER stress through expression of mutants of human GBA gene in the eye of Drosophila.	0
Genetic and clinical features of patients with Gaucher disease in Hungary. ||  || The aim of this study was to identify mutations in the gene encoding for lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA; gene symbol, GBA) in Hungarian patients with Gaucher disease (GD), and to study genotype-phenotype relationships. Genotypes and allele variations in 27 patients with type I GD of 25 unrelated families were studied. Of the 54 mutant alleles, we detected 38 frequent (N370S, 22/54; RecNciI, 8/54; L444P, 8/54) and 9 rare (N188S, R257Q, R285C, G377S, R120W, T323I, 84GG, 1263-1317del and 1263-1317del/RecTL) mutations. In addition, we identified two novel mutations. The N370S/RecNciI genotype found in 8 patients and the N370S/L444P genotype found in 5 patients were the most frequent genotypes in this cohort. In 22 patients the mutations occurred in heterozygosity with the N370S sequence variant, and one patient was homozygous for the L444P mutation. These data suggest that N370S, RecNciI, and L444P are the most prevalent mutations in Hungarian patients with GD. This mutation profile is characteristic for a Caucasian (non-Jewish) population. The c.260G>A and c.999G>A missense mutations are described here for the first time in GD patients contributing to the panel of reported GBA mutations.	1 4
Independent mutations at codon 3500 of the apolipoprotein B gene are associated with hyperlipidemia. ||  || The apoB arginine-to glutamine change at codon 3500 has become established as a cause of failure of binding of the LDL particle to its receptor and the consequent hypercholesterolemia of familial defective apoB 100. A search for further similar mutations was undertaken by systematic screening of a candidate region of the apoB gene from individuals with hypercholesterolemia. Polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were used. We describe two families in which a different mutation in the codon 3500 causes an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution. Most adults in these families who have this mutation have hypercholesterolemia. LDL derived from all who have inherited the mutation is dysfunctional in that it allows only poor growth of an LDL cholesterol-dependent cell line. We conclude that this arginine 3500 is essential to the function of apoB and that its loss and replacement by glutamine or tryptophan is responsible for the hypercholesterolemia of familial defective apoB 100.	2
Novel and recurrent mutations of the LDL receptor gene in Korean patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || We have identified 16 different mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene in 25 unrelated Korean patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), including five novel mutations, C83Y, 661del17, 1705insCTAG, C675X, and 941-1G>A. The 1705insCTAG mutation in which the four 3 cent -terminal nucleotides of exon 11 are duplicated was found to prevent splicing of exon 11 and would therefore generate a truncated polypeptide. The in-frame 36-bp deletion (1591del36) in exon 11, which had been reported only in one Korean FH patient, was also found. We showed that this change affects transport of the LDL receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. In addition, we found 8 mutations (-136C>T, E119K, E207K, E207X, F382L, R574Q, 1846-1G>A, and P664L) that had been described in other ethnic groups but not in Koreans, and 2 mutations (R94H and D200N) that had been described in Koreans as well as other ethnic groups. 5 mutations (1591del36, E119K, E207X, E207K, and P664L) were found more than once in the Korean FH samples. Identification of the novel and recurring LDLR mutations in Korean FH patients should facilitate prenatal and early diagnosis in families at high risk of FH.	4
Presenting symptoms of GBA-related Parkinson's disease. || Glucocerebrosidase Pain Parkinson's disease Presenting symptom || Mutations in the Glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been shown that GBA-related PD (PD-GBA) patients had an earlier age at PD onset and more prevalent non-motor symptoms when compared to "sporadic" PD patients without such mutations (sPD). To explore whether presenting symptoms differ between PD-GBA and sPD patients. Demographic and clinical features (including presenting symptoms) were collected for 578 PD patients. Sequence analysis was performed for exons 8-11 of the GBA gene for all participants. 39 PD patients (6.7%) with GBA mutations were compared to 539 PD patients without them. Although no statistically significant differences were found regarding the presenting symptoms, we observed that pain was more frequently reported as an initial problem in the PD-GBA (10.3%) than in the sPD group (3.0%) (chi square p = 0.039; logistic regression analysis OR = 3.74; p = 0.024). Overall, the presenting symptoms were similar in PD-GBA and sPD patients, with the exception that pain might be more frequent in PD-GBA.	4
Long term memory profile of disorders associated with dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade. ||  || In the present study we evaluated long term memory in twenty individuals with molecularly confirmed diagnosis of Noonan syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome, two disorders caused by mutations in genes coding transducers participating in the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade. The profile of explicit long term memory abilities was investigated using PROMEA, which includes a battery of tests specifically developed to assess memory and learning in verbal, visual and spatial domains. Ten individuals (50%) had impaired (≤5th percentile) or below average (≤15th percentile) performance on a delayed verbal free recall memory task, four (20%) on a delayed visual recognition memory task, and only one (5%) on a delayed spatial recognition memory task. Our data suggest that dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK cascade may be associated with a pattern of reduced verbal recall memory performance but relative sparing of visual and spatial recognition memory.	4
Use of a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method for the detection of deletions/duplications in the GBA1 gene in Gaucher disease patients. || GBA1 Gaucher disease MLPA Molecular diagnosis || Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by the deficient activity of β-glucocerebrosidase due to pathogenic mutations in the GBA1. This gene has a pseudogene (GBAP) with 96% of sequence homology. Recombination (Rec) events in the GBA1 seem to be facilitated by an increased degree of homology and proximity to the GBAP. The objectives of this study were to validate the P338-X1 GBA kit (MRC-Holland) for Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and to detect larger deletions/duplications present in GBA1 in GD patients from Brazil. Thirty-three unrelated Brazilian GD patients, previously genotyped by the Sanger method (both pathogenic alleles identified=29 patients, only one allele identified=3 patients, no pathogenic alleles identified=1 patient), were evaluated by the MLPA assay. MLPA was compatible with the previous results obtained by Sanger sequencing and identified an additional allele (a heterozygous deletion in intron 7 in one patient with only one mutation identified by Sanger). Our data suggest that, although larger deletions/duplications do not appear to be frequent in GD, the P338-X1 GBA kit for MLPA appears to be a good method for GBA1 analysis. Additional investigations should be performed in order to characterize the remaining four uncharacterized alleles of our sample.	1 4
A preliminary study to evaluate the strategy of combining clinical criteria and next generation sequencing (NGS) for the identification of monogenic diabetes among multi-ethnic Asians. || Genetic testing MODY Monogenic diabetes Next-generation sequencing || Diabetes is increasing globally and Asia is the epicenter. Among those with young-onset diabetes (<45years), the prevalence of monogenic diabetes is estimated to be non-trivial (∼5%). An accurate diagnosis of monogenic diabetes is important to inform treatment, prognosis and genetic counseling. Therefore, a robust clinical algorithm to identify probands for testing is needed. Our aims are (1) to select probands for genetic testing and variant identification based on their clinical phenotype and (2) to evaluate the MODY probability calculator in our multi-ethnic Asian population. Eighty-four potential probands, identified in accordance with clinical practice guidelines, were subjected to re-sequencing of 16 monogenic diabetes genes and targeted genotyping for mitochondrial 3243A>G point-mutation. Variants, confirmed by bi-directional Sanger sequencing, were classified as pathogenic if they fulfilled the criteria adapted from American College of Medical Genetics. Performance of MODY calculator (with positive-predictive threshold set at >62.4%) for those with diabetes-onset ⩽35years (data input-limit) (n=71) was also evaluated. Thirteen subjects (15.5%) harbored likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants: 6 (2 novel) in HNF1A (1 subject concomitantly had another HNF4A variant), 1 in HNF4A, 2 in mt3243A>G and 1 each in GCK, KCNJ11 (novel), ABCC8 (novel) and PAX4 (novel). Performance of the MODY calculator was: sensitivity 0.769, specificity 0.603 and negative predictive value 0.921. When analysis was restricted to MODY1-3, the performance was: 0.875, 0.587 and 0.974, respectively. The prevalence of MODY is non-trivial (∼15%) among Asians with young-onset diabetes. MODY calculator performs well in our population in nominating probands for genetic testing.	4
Novel pathogenic mutations in the glucocerebrosidase locus. ||  || To determine the frequency of mutations responsible for Gaucher's disease, we systematically sequenced the GBA1 gene as part of a molecular characterization of 73 adult patients in the United Kingdom. Five hitherto unknown pathogenic variants were identified, one of which is a splice site change; the others are novel missense mutations. Given that GBA1 gene mutations are an important risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease, we contend that a complete analysis and molecular characterization of both the known and novel GBA1 variants will be needed before the biochemical processes underlying this genetic association can be fully understood.	4
Modulation of phenotypic expression of APOA5 Q97X and L242P mutations. ||  || To provide phenotypic and functional data in new patients with APOA5 mutations and to identify genetic and metabolic factors influencing their phenotypic expression. By sequencing APOA5 gene in a cohort of 286 hyperchylomicronemic subjects, free of LPL or APOC2 mutations, we identified 4 unrelated carriers of the Q97X mutation (3 heterozygotes and 1 homozygote) and one heterozygote with a new L242P mutation. Postheparin LPL activity level was reduced by about 50% in Q97X heterozygotes and more than 90% in the Q97X homozygote, but was normal in the L242P patient after resolution of hyperchylomicronemia. Plasma apoAV was undetectable in the Q97X homozygote and in the normal range in the L242P and Q97X heterozygous carriers. In Western blot studies, the association of apoAV with plasma lipoproteins was altered in Q97X heterozygous carriers but not in the L242P carrier. Hyperchylomicronemic heterozygotes for both mutations carried an additional APOA5 variant haplotype and/or APOE variant (E2 or E4). Type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome were not a major phenotypic determinant. The L242P mutation was present in a hyperchylomicronemic proband but its causal involvement remains to be established. The Q97X mutation was clearly involved in hyperchylomicronemia with evidence of concomitant altered intravascular lipolysis, and a complete apoAV deficiency in the homozygote. The phenotypic expression variability of APOA5 mutations was mostly influenced by compound heterozygosity with APOA5 variant haplotypes plus additional genetic factors, and in a lesser extent by the metabolic environment.	4 2
New contributions to the study of common double mutants in the human LDL receptor gene. ||  || Variations in the gene encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) can cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders in humans. The functional effects of the p.Gln92Glu and p.Asn564His alterations are predicted as benign, but the c.313 + 1G>C and p.Lys799_Phe801del changes are believed to cause disease. Although p.Gln92Glu and c.313 + 1G>C have been observed only in Spain, p.Asn564His and p.Lys799_Phe801del are widespread in Western Europe. In order to estimate the ages (t generations) of these four variants of the gene, to determine their possible origin and to consider the influence of age and selective pressure on their spread, we analyzed 86 healthy individuals and 126 FH patients in Spain. Most of the FH patients investigated carried two of these four LDLR variants simultaneously, while only one patient carried three of them simultaneously. Haplotype analyses were based on five LDLR SNPs: c.81T>C, c.1413G>A, c.1725C>T, c.1959T>C and c.2232G>A. The results suggest that p.Gln92Glu and c.313 + 1G>C arose at about the same time (99 and 103 generations ago, respectively) in the CACTG haplotype and that p.Asn564His and p.Lys799_Phe801del appeared in the CGCCG haplotype and might be slightly more recent variations (92 and 95 generations ago, respectively). Low selective pressures could explain the maintenance of these variants in spite of their ages. The origin of p.Gln92Glu and c.313 + 1G>C appears to be in Spain whereas p.Asn564His and p.Lys799_Phe801del could have been introduced in Spain by Celtic migrations in the seventh to fifth centuries BC.	4
De novo somatic mutations in components of the PI3K-AKT3-mTOR pathway cause hemimegalencephaly. ||  || De novo somatic mutations in focal areas are well documented in diseases such as neoplasia but are rarely reported in malformation of the developing brain. Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is characterized by overgrowth of either one of the two cerebral hemispheres. The molecular etiology of HME remains a mystery. The intractable epilepsy that is associated with HME can be relieved by the surgical treatment hemispherectomy, allowing sampling of diseased tissue. Exome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis in paired brain-blood samples from individuals with HME (n = 20 cases) identified de novo somatic mutations in 30% of affected individuals in the PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR genes. A recurrent PIK3CA c.1633G>A mutation was found in four separate cases. Identified mutations were present in 8-40% of sequenced alleles in various brain regions and were associated with increased neuronal S6 protein phosphorylation in the brains of affected individuals, indicating aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Thus HME is probably a genetically mosaic disease caused by gain of function in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT3-mTOR signaling.	4 0
High frequency of mutation G377S in Brazilian type 3 Gaucher disease patients. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD), the most prevalent lysosome storage disorder, presents an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is a paradigm for therapeutic intervention in medical genetics due to the existence of effective enzyme replacement therapy. We report here the analysis of GD in 262 unrelated Brazilian patients, carried out in order to establish the frequency of the most common mutations and to provide prognostic information based on genotype-phenotype correlations. Among 247 type 1 GD patients, mutation N370S was detected in 47% of all the alleles, but N370S/N370S homozygosity was found in only 10% of the patients, a much lower frequency than expected, suggesting that most individuals presenting this genotype may not receive medical attention. Recombinant alleles were detected at a high frequency: 44% of the chromosomes bearing mutation L444P had other mutations derived from the pseudogene sequence, present in 25% of patients. Three neuronopathic type 2 patients were homozygous for L444P, all presenting additional mutations (E326K or recombinant alleles) that probably lead to the more severe phenotypes. Six children, classified as type 1 GD patients, had a L444P/L444P genotype, showing that neuronopathic symptoms may only manifest later in life. This would indicate the need for a higher treatment dose during enzyme replacement therapy. Finally, mutation G377S was present in 4 homozygous type 1 patients and also in compound heterozygosity in 5 (42%) type 3 patients. These findings indicate that G377S cannot be unambiguously classified as mild and suggest an allele-dose effect for this mutation.	1 4 3
Clinical and biochemical features of different molecular etiologies of familial chylomicronemia. || Familial chylomicronemia syndrome Genetic variation Genetics Hypertriglyceridemia Lipolysis Lipoprotein lipase Next-generation DNA sequencing Pancreatitis Type I hyperlipoproteinemia Volanesorsen || Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is an ultra-rare phenotype that is usually caused by biallelic mutations in the LPL gene encoding lipoprotein lipase, or less often in APOC2, APOA5, LMF1, or GPIHBP1 genes encoding cofactors or interacting proteins. We evaluated baseline phenotypes among FCS participants in a phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trial of volanesorsen (NCT02211209). Baseline clinical, fasting, and postfat load metabolic markers were assessed. Targeted next-generation DNA sequencing plus custom bioinformatics was used to genotype subjects. Among 52 FCS individuals, 41 had biallelic LPL gene mutations (LPL-FCS patients): 82%, 7%, and 11% were missense, nonsense, and splicing variants, respectively. Eleven individuals had non-LPL-FCS; 2 had mutations in APOA5, 5 in GPIHBP1, and 1 each in LMF1 and APOC2 genes, respectively. Two other individuals were double heterozygotes, each with 1 normal LPL allele. All subjects had extremely high triglycerides (TGs) and chylomicrons, but very low levels of other lipoproteins. Compared with LPL-FCS individuals, non-LPL-FCS individuals were very similar for most traits, but had significantly higher postheparin LPL activity, higher 4-hour postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels; and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In non-LPL-FCS individuals compared to those with LPL-FCS, there were also nonsignificant trends toward lower levels of total and chylomicron TGs, lower 4-hour postprandial chylomicron TG levels, and higher very-low-density lipoprotein TG levels. Thus, LPL FCS and non-LPL FCS are largely phenotypically similar. However, LPL FCS patients have lower postheparin LPL activity and a trend toward higher TGs, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher in non-LPL-FCS patients.	4
Molecular basis of familial chylomicronemia: mutations in the lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein C-II genes. ||  || The molecular basis of familial chylomicronemia (type I hyperlipoproteinemia), a rare autosomal recessive trait, was investigated in six unrelated individuals (five of Spanish descent and one of Northern European extraction). DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis allowed rapid identification of the underlying mutations. Six different mutant alleles (three of which are previously undescribed) of the gene encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were discovered in the five LPL-deficient patients. These included an 11 bp deletion in exon 2, and five missense mutations: Trp 86 Arg (exon 3), His 136 Arg (exon 4), Gly 188 Glu (exon 5), Ile 194 Thr (exon 5), and Ile 205 Ser (exon 5). The Trp 86 Arg mutation is the only known missense mutation in exon 3. The other missense mutations lie in the highly conserved "central homology region" in close proximity with the catalytic site of LPL. These and other previously reported missense mutations provide insight into structure/function relationships in the lipase family. The missense mutations point to the important role of particular highly conserved helices and beta-strands in proper folding of the LPL molecule, and of certain connecting loops in the catalytic process. A nonsense mutation (Arg 19 Term) in the gene encoding apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), the cofactor of LPL, was found to underlie chylomicronemia in the sixth patient who had normal LPL but was apoC-II-deficient.	4 2
A-beta-subtype of ketosis-prone diabetes is not predominantly a monogenic diabetic syndrome. ||  || Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is an emerging syndrome that encompasses several distinct phenotypic subgroups that share a predisposition to diabetic ketoacidosis. We investigated whether the A-beta- subgroup of KPD, characterized by complete insulin dependence, absent beta-cell functional reserve, lack of islet cell autoantibodies, and strong family history of type 2 diabetes, represents a monogenic form of diabetes. Over 8 years, 37 patients with an A-beta- phenotype were identified in our longitudinally followed cohort of KPD patients. Seven genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), glucokinase (GCK), HNF1A, pancreas duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), HNF1B, neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1), and PAX4, were directly sequenced in all patients. Selected gene regions were also sequenced in healthy, unrelated ethnically matched control subjects, consisting of 84 African American, 96 Caucasian, and 95 Hispanic subjects. The majority (70%) of the A-beta- KPD patients had no significant causal polymorphisms in either the proximal promoter or coding regions of the seven genes. The combination of six potentially significant low-frequency, heterozygous sequence variants in HNF-1 alpha (A174V or G574S), PDX1 (putative 5'-untranslated region CCAAT box, P33T, or P239Q), or PAX4 (R133W) were found in 27% (10/37) of patients, with one additional patient revealing two variants, PDX1 P33T and PAX4 R133W. The A174V variant has not been previously reported. Despite its well-circumscribed, robust, and distinctive phenotype of severe, nonautoimmune-mediated beta-cell dysfunction, A-beta- KPD is most likely not a predominantly monogenic diabetic syndrome. Several A-beta- KPD patients have low-frequency variants in HNF1A, PDX1, or PAX4 genes, which may be of functional significance in their pathophysiology.	4
Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is caused by mutations in ETHE1, a gene encoding a mitochondrial matrix protein. ||  || Ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE) is a devastating infantile metabolic disorder affecting the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and peripheral vessels. High levels of ethylmalonic acid are detected in the body fluids, and cytochrome c oxidase activity is decreased in skeletal muscle. By use of a combination of homozygosity mapping, integration of physical and functional genomic data sets, and mutational screening, we identified GenBank D83198 as the gene responsible for EE. We also demonstrated that the D83198 protein product is targeted to mitochondria and internalized into the matrix after energy-dependent cleavage of a short leader peptide. The gene had previously been known as "HSCO" (for hepatoma subtracted clone one). However, given its role in EE, the name of the gene has been changed to "ETHE1." The severe consequences of its malfunctioning indicate an important role of the ETHE1 gene product in mitochondrial homeostasis and energy metabolism.	1
The glucocerobrosidase E326K variant predisposes to Parkinson's disease, but does not cause Gaucher's disease. ||  || Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the acid beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, responsible for the recessive lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher's disease (GD), are the strongest known risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim was to assess the contribution of GBA1 mutations in a series of early-onset PD. One hundred and eighty-five PD patients (with an onset age of ≤50) and 283 age-matched controls were screened for GBA1 mutations by Sanger sequencing. We show that the frequency of GBA1 mutations is much higher in this patient series than in typical late-onset patient cohorts. Furthermore, our results reveal that the most prevalent PD-associated GBA1 mutation is E326K, a variant that does not, when homozygous, cause GD. Our results confirm recent reports that the mutation, E326K, predisposes to PD and suggest that, in addition to reduced GBA1 activity, other molecular mechanisms may contribute to the development of the disease.	1 0
Identification of novel splice site mutation IVS9 + 1(G > A) and novel complex allele G355R/R359X in Type 1 Gaucher patients heterozygous for mutation N370S. || Complex alleles EC, enzyme commission number GBA novel mutations GBA, glucocerebrosidase enzyme protein GBA, glucocerebrosidase gene GD, Gaucher disease Gaucher disease Glucocerebrosidase Hb, hemoglobin MRI, magnetic resonance imaging OMIM, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man entry number PCR, polymerase chain reaction RFLP analysis RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR Sequence analysis bp, base pairs pJET cloning || Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder resulting from deficient glucocerebrosidase activity. More than 350 mutations that cause Gaucher disease have been described to date. Novel mutations can potentially provide insight into the glucocerebrosidase structure-function relationship and biochemical basis of the disease. Here, we report the identification of two novel mutations in two unrelated patients with type I (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher disease: 1) a splice site mutation IVS9 + 1G > A; and (2) a complex allele (cis) G355R/R359X. Both patients have a common N370S mutation in the other allele. The splice site mutation results from an intronic base substitution (G to A, c.1328 + 1, g.5005) at the donor splice site of exon and intron 9. The complex allele results from two point mutations in exon 8 of glucocerebrosidase (G to C at c.1180, g.4396, and T to C at c. 1192, g.4408) substituting glycine by arginine (G355R) and arginine by a premature termination (R359X), respectively. In order to demonstrate that G355R/R359X are in cis arrangement, PCR-amplified glucocerebrosidase exon 8 genomic DNA from the patient was cloned into the vector pJET1.2 in Escherichia coli TOP10® strain. Out of the 15 clones that were sequence analyzed, 10 contained the normal allele sequence and 5 contained the complex allele G355R/R359X sequence showing both mutations in cis arrangement. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using Hph1 restriction endonuclease digest was established for the IVS9 + 1G > A mutation for confirmation and efficient identification of this mutation in future patients. Past literature suggests that mutations affecting splicing patterns of the glucocerebrosidase transcript as well as mutations in Gaucher complex alleles are detrimental to enzyme activity. However, compound heterozygosity with N370S, a mild mutation, will lead to a mild phenotype. The cases reported here support these past findings.	1
Genetic screening of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH): a New Zealand perspective. ||  || Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to screen the LDL receptor gene of people with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in Christchurch, New Zealand, we have identified mutations in 65 patients (44 different mutations, of which 15 are novel). We also test family members of probands for the mutation identified in their relative, allowing diagnosis of affected children and those without classical FH symptoms. This screening programme is helpful to clinicians and benefits FH patients and their families, and has provided us with a pool of LDL receptor variants on which to base research into this disease.	4
APOA5 Q97X mutation identified through homozygosity mapping causes severe hypertriglyceridemia in a Chilean consanguineous family. ||  || Severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) has been linked to defects in LPL, APOC2, APOA5, LMF1 and GBIHBP1 genes. However, a number of severe HTG cases are probably caused by as yet unidentified mutations. Very high triglyceride plasma levels (>112 mmol/L at diagnosis) were found in two sisters of a Chilean consanguineous family, which is strongly suggestive of a recessive highly penetrant mutation. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic locus responsible for the severe HTG in this family. We carried out a genome-wide linkage study with nearly 300,000 biallelic markers (Illumina Human CytoSNP-12 panel). Using the homozygosity mapping strategy, we searched for chromosome regions with excess of homozygous genotypes in the affected cases compared to non-affected relatives. A large homozygous segment was found in the long arm of chromosome 11, with more than 2,500 consecutive homozygous SNP shared by the proband with her affected sister, and containing the APOA5/A4/C3/A1 cluster. Direct sequencing of the APOA5 gene revealed a known homozygous nonsense Q97X mutation (p.Gln97Ter) found in both affected sisters but not in non-affected relatives nor in a sample of unrelated controls. The Q97X mutation of the APOA5 gene in homozygous status is responsible for the severe hypertriglyceridemia in this family. We have shown that homozygosity mapping correctly pinpointed the genomic region containing the gene responsible for severe hypertriglyceridemia in this consanguineous Chilean family.	4 2
Islet autoantibodies can discriminate maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) from Type 1 diabetes. ||  || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is a monogenic form of familial, young-onset diabetes. It is rare (∼1% diabetes) and may be misdiagnosed as Type 1 diabetes and inappropriately treated with insulin. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the presence of islet autoantibodies, including glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and islet antigen-2 (IA-2) antibodies. The prevalence of islet autoantibodies is unknown in maturity-onset diabetes of the young and may have the potential to differentiate this form of diabetes from Type 1 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of GAD and IA-2 antibodies in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and Type 1 diabetes. We measured plasma GAD and IA-2 antibodies in 508 patients with the most common forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK: n = 227; HNF1A: n = 229; HNF4A: n = 52) and 98 patients with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes (diagnosed < 6 months). Autoantibodies were considered positive if ≥ 99th centile of 500 adult control subjects. GAD and/or IA-2 antibodies were present in 80/98 (82%) patients with Type 1 diabetes and 5/508 (< 1%) patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young. In the cohort with Type 1 diabetes, both GAD and IA-2 antibodies were detected in 37.8% of patients, GAD only in 24.5% and IA-2 only in 19.4%. All five patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young with detectable antibodies had GAD antibodies and none had detectable IA-2 antibodies. The prevalence of GAD and IA-2 antibodies in maturity-onset diabetes of the young is the same as in control subjects (< 1%). The finding of islet autoantibodies, especially IA-2 antibodies, makes the diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young very unlikely and genetic testing should only be performed if other clinical characteristics strongly suggest this form of diabetes rather than Type 1 diabetes. This supports routine islet autoantibody testing before proceeding to more expensive molecular genetic testing.	4
Impaired gait kinematics in type 1 Gaucher's Disease. || Gaucher’s disease Parkinson disease extrapyramidal system gait analysis joint excursion parkinsonism || Type 1 Gaucher's disease (GD1) is traditionally regarded as "non-neurological". Spatiotemporal and kinematic analysis of gait was carried on thirteen GD1 patients and thirteen healthy controls. We identified a previously unknown subclinical reduction of amplitude of movements in GD1. Articular excursion of ankle, knee and hip was reduced during the swing phase of gait (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the excursion of the knee appeared also significantly more asymmetric in GD1 patients (p = 0.02). Correction for age, BMI and basal walking speed did not modify the significance. Accordingly to the recent observations that GD1 predisposes to Parkinson's disease, the impaired and asymmetric gait kinematics that we observed might be interpreted as a form of extrapyramidal involvement.	1 4
Clinical and molecular characterisation of 300 patients with congenital hyperinsulinism. ||  || Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a clinically heterogeneous condition. Mutations in eight genes (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, GCK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A and HNF1A) are known to cause CHI. To characterise the clinical and molecular aspects of a large cohort of patients with CHI. Three hundred patients were recruited and clinical information was collected before genotyping. ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were analysed in all patients. Mutations in GLUD1, HADH, GCK and HNF4A genes were sought in patients with diazoxide-responsive CHI with hyperammonaemia (GLUD1), raised 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine and/or consanguinity (HADH), positive family history (GCK) or when CHI was diagnosed within the first week of life (HNF4A). Mutations were identified in 136/300 patients (45.3%). Mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 were the commonest genetic cause identified (n=109, 36.3%). Among diazoxide-unresponsive patients (n=105), mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 were identified in 92 (87.6%) patients, of whom 63 patients had recessively inherited mutations while four patients had dominantly inherited mutations. A paternal mutation in the ABCC8/KCNJ11 genes was identified in 23 diazoxide-unresponsive patients, of whom six had diffuse disease. Among the diazoxide-responsive patients (n=183), mutations were identified in 41 patients (22.4%). These include mutations in ABCC8/KCNJ11 (n=15), HNF4A (n=7), GLUD1 (n=16) and HADH (n=3). A genetic diagnosis was made for 45.3% of patients in this large series. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene were the commonest identifiable cause. The vast majority of patients with diazoxide-responsive CHI (77.6%) had no identifiable mutations, suggesting other genetic and/or environmental mechanisms.	4
Functional analysis of 11 novel GBA alleles. ||  || Gaucher disease is the most frequent lysosomal storage disorder due to the deficiency of the acid β-glucosidase, encoded by the GBA gene. In this study, we report the structural and functional characterization of 11 novel GBA alleles. Seven single missense alleles, P159S, N188I, E235K, P245T, W312S, S366R and W381C, and two alleles carrying in cis mutations, (N188S; G265R) and (E326K; D380N), were studied for enzyme activity in transiently transfected cells. All mutants were inactive except the P159S, which retained 15% of wild-type activity. To further characterize the alleles carrying two in cis mutations, we expressed constructs bearing singly each mutation. The presence of G265R or D380N mutations completely abolished enzyme activity, while N188S and E326K mutants retained 25 and 54% of wild-type activity, respectively. Two mutations, affecting the acceptor splice site of introns 5 (c.589-1G>A) and 9 (c.1389-1G>A), led to the synthesis of aberrant mRNA. Unpredictably, family studies showed that two alleles resulted from germline or 'de novo' mutations. These results strengthen the importance of performing a complete and accurate molecular analysis of the GBA gene in order to avoid misleading conclusions and provide a comprehensive functional analysis of new GBA mutations.	1
Evaluation of the detection of GBA missense mutations and other variants using the Oxford Nanopore MinION. || GBA Gaucher disease Oxford Nanopore MinION Parkinson’s disease long-read sequencing mutation detection mutation phasing || Mutations in GBA cause Gaucher disease when biallelic and are strong risk factors for Parkinson's disease when heterozygous. GBA analysis is complicated by the nearby pseudogene. We aimed to design and validate a method for sequencing GBA using long reads. We sequenced GBA on the Oxford Nanopore MinION as an 8.9 kb amplicon from 102 individuals, including patients with Parkinson's and Gaucher diseases. We used NanoOK for quality metrics, NGMLR to align data (after comparing with GraphMap), Nanopolish and Sniffles to call variants, and WhatsHap for phasing. We detected all known missense mutations in these samples, including the common p.N409S (N370S) and p.L483P (L444P) in multiple samples, and nine rarer ones, as well as a splicing and a truncating mutation, and intronic SNPs. We demonstrated the ability to phase mutations, confirm compound heterozygosity, and assign haplotypes. We also detected two known risk variants in some Parkinson's patients. Rare false positives were easily identified and filtered, with the Nanopolish quality score adjusted for the number of reads a very robust discriminator. In two individuals carrying a recombinant allele, we were able to detect and fully define it in one carrier, where it included a 55-base pair deletion, but not in another one, suggesting a limitation of the PCR enrichment method. Missense mutations were detected at the correct zygosity, except for the case where the RecNciI one was missed. The Oxford Nanopore MinION can detect missense mutations and an exonic deletion in this difficult gene, with the added advantages of phasing and intronic analysis. It can be used as an efficient research tool, but additional work is required to exclude all recombinants.	1 4
Thalamic and dentate nucleus abnormalities in the brain of children with Gaucher disease. || Brain Diffusion-weighted imaging Gaucher disease Lysosomal storage disorders Magnetic resonance imaging || Gaucher disease (GD) represents the most common lysosomal storage defect. It is classified into three phenotypes: type 1 non-neuronopathic, type 2 acute neuronopathic, and type 3 subacute/chronic neuronopathic. Although children affected by GD may present with a broad spectrum of neurological signs, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are usually normal or non-specific. We report three cases of GD with previously undescribed brain MRI changes mainly affecting the thalami and/or the dentate nuclei. We discuss the possible etiopathogenesis of these abnormalities. Correlation between brain MRI abnormalities, neurological symptoms, and treatment efficacy is still unclear.	1
Increased yield of full GBA sequencing in Ashkenazi Jews with Parkinson's disease. ||  || Variants in GBA are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), and are especially prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. However, most studies on GBA in AJ genotype only seven selected Gaucher-associated pathogenic variants rather than sequencing the whole gene, which may leave carriers of PD-associated GBA variants undiscovered. GBA was fully sequenced using molecular inversion probes (MIPs) and Sanger sequencing in 735 AJ PD patients and 662 AJ controls, from Israel and New York. Additional AJ control data (n = 3044) from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Exome Portal was used. Full GBA sequencing increased the number of variants discovered by 17.4%, compared to targeted genotyping. An additional 17 PD patients were identified with GBA-associated PD. The p.E326K variant was found in 1.6% of AJ PD patients, making it the second most common PD-associated GBA variant in AJ. GBA variants were found in 18% of PD patients and 7.5% of controls (OR = 2.7, 95%CI = 1.9-3.8, p < 0.0001). Without full sequencing of GBA, or at minimum including p.E326K in the genotyping panel, a significant proportion of variant carriers go undiscovered and may be incorrectly assigned as non-carriers in studies or clinical trials.	4
Point mutations in the PDX1 transactivation domain impair human β-cell development and function. || Insulin secretion PDX1 PDX1-Bound genes Transactivation domain β-Cell differentiation || Hundreds of missense mutations in the coding region of PDX1 exist; however, if these mutations predispose to diabetes mellitus is unknown. In this study, we screened a large cohort of subjects with increased risk for diabetes and identified two subjects with impaired glucose tolerance carrying common, heterozygous, missense mutations in the PDX1 coding region leading to single amino acid exchanges (P33T, C18R) in its transactivation domain. We generated iPSCs from patients with heterozygous PDX1<sup>P33T/+</sup>, PDX1<sup>C18R/+</sup> mutations and engineered isogenic cell lines carrying homozygous PDX1<sup>P33T/P33T</sup>, PDX1<sup>C18R/C18R</sup> mutations and a heterozygous PDX1 loss-of-function mutation (PDX1<sup>+/-</sup>). Using an in vitro β-cell differentiation protocol, we demonstrated that both, heterozygous PDX1<sup>P33T/+</sup>, PDX1<sup>C18R/+</sup> and homozygous PDX1<sup>P33T/P33T</sup>, PDX1<sup>C18R/C18R</sup> mutations impair β-cell differentiation and function. Furthermore, PDX1<sup>+/-</sup> and PDX1<sup>P33T/P33T</sup> mutations reduced differentiation efficiency of pancreatic progenitors (PPs), due to downregulation of PDX1-bound genes, including transcription factors MNX1 and PDX1 as well as insulin resistance gene CES1. Additionally, both PDX1<sup>P33T/+</sup> and PDX1<sup>P33T/P33T</sup> mutations in PPs reduced the expression of PDX1-bound genes including the long-noncoding RNA, MEG3 and the imprinted gene NNAT, both involved in insulin synthesis and secretion. Our results reveal mechanistic details of how common coding mutations in PDX1 impair human pancreatic endocrine lineage formation and β-cell function and contribute to the predisposition for diabetes.	4 0
2-deoxy-2-[18]fluoro-D-glucose PET/CT (18FDG PET/CT) may not be a viable biomarker in Pompe disease. || 2-deoxy-2-[18]fluoro-D-glucose PET CT Biomarker MRI Pompe disease || Pompe disease (PD) is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease due to a mutation of the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene. In adult patients, PD is characterized by slowly progressive limb-girdle and trunk myopathy and restrictive respiratory insufficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available, improving or stabilizing muscle-function in some and slowing deterioration in other patients. Unfortunately, there is no biomarker available to indicate therapeutic efficacy and/or disease activity. Whole body MRI depicts all skeletal muscles demonstrating foci of atrophic muscles, i.e., late and irreversible pathological changes. Any method indicating the localizations of increased muscle glycogen storage, muscle inflammation and/or degradation could possibly help identifying newly afflicted tissue and may be of prognostic value. We therefore investigated 2-deoxy-2-[18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET, a biomarker for glucose-metabolism, as a tool to evaluate disease activity and prognosis in PD. In a pilot study, we investigated four patients by FDG dynamic PET/CT while on ERT. One patient had FDG-PET/CT twice, before and after 12 months on ERT. Dynamic FDG-PET/CT quantifies the metabolic rate of glucose utilisation in mg/ml/min. MRI was performed in parallel with pelvic and thigh muscles semi-quantitatively scored for atrophy and disease-activity. None of the muscles analysed showed a focally increased FDG-uptake. Thus, quantification of muscle glucose metabolism could not be calculated. However, increased FDG-uptake, i.e., increased glucose utilisation, was observed in the respiratory muscles of one patient with severe, restrictive respiratory failure. In contrast, specific MRI sequences showed oedematous as well as atrophic muscle areas in PD. Our pilot study demonstrates that FDG-uptake does not correlate with glycogen storage in vivo. In contrast, MRI is an excellent tool to demonstrate the extent of muscle involvement. Specific MRI sequences may even demonstrate early changes possibly allowing prognostic predictions or localization of early stages of PD.	1
Glucocerebrosidase activity in Parkinson's disease with and without GBA mutations. || LRRK2 Parkinson’s disease genetics glucocerebrosidase lysosome || Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations have been associated with Parkinson's disease in numerous studies. However, it is unknown whether the increased risk of Parkinson's disease in GBA carriers is due to a loss of glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity. We measured glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots in patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 517) and controls (n = 252) with and without GBA mutations. Participants were recruited from Columbia University, New York, and fully sequenced for GBA mutations and genotyped for the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, the most common autosomal dominant mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in dried blood spots was measured by a mass spectrometry-based assay and compared among participants categorized by GBA mutation status and Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Parkinson's disease patients were more likely than controls to carry the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (n = 39, 7.5% versus n = 2, 0.8%, P < 0.001) and GBA mutations or variants (seven homozygotes and compound heterozygotes and 81 heterozygotes, 17.0% versus 17 heterozygotes, 6.7%, P < 0.001). GBA homozygotes/compound heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA heterozygotes (0.85 µmol/l/h versus 7.88 µmol/l/h, P < 0.001), and GBA heterozygotes had lower enzymatic activity than GBA and LRRK2 non-carriers (7.88 µmol/l/h versus 11.93 µmol/l/h, P < 0.001). Glucocerebrosidase activity was reduced in heterozygotes compared to non-carriers when each mutation was compared independently (N370S, P < 0.001; L444P, P < 0.001; 84GG, P = 0.003; R496H, P = 0.018) and also reduced in GBA variants associated with Parkinson's risk but not with Gaucher disease (E326K, P = 0.009; T369M, P < 0.001). When all patients with Parkinson's disease were considered, they had lower mean glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity than controls (11.14 µmol/l/h versus 11.85 µmol/l/h, P = 0.011). Difference compared to controls persisted in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (after exclusion of all GBA and LRRK2 carriers; 11.53 µmol/l/h, versus 12.11 µmol/l/h, P = 0.036) and after adjustment for age and gender (P = 0.012). Interestingly, LRRK2 G2019S carriers (n = 36), most of whom had Parkinson's disease, had higher enzymatic activity than non-carriers (13.69 µmol/l/h versus 11.93 µmol/l/h, P = 0.002). In patients with idiopathic Parkinson's, higher glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity was associated with longer disease duration (P = 0.002) in adjusted models, suggesting a milder disease course. We conclude that lower glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity is strongly associated with GBA mutations, and modestly with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The association of lower glucocerebrosidase activity in both GBA mutation carriers and Parkinson's patients without GBA mutations suggests that loss of glucocerebrosidase function contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. High glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity in LRRK2 G2019S carriers may reflect a distinct pathogenic mechanism. Taken together, these data suggest that glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity could be a modifiable therapeutic target.	1 4
Is the perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease more common than classic type 2 Gaucher disease? ||  || In recent years there has been increased recognition of a severe perinatal lethal form of Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. We previously reported a case of severe type 2 Gaucher disease which was seen in a medical center in Rotterdam and now present three new cases from two other families seen at the same center. Mutational analyses of these cases revealed two novel mutations, H311R and V398F, located in exons 8 and 9, respectively. The identification of four cases of lethal type 2 Gaucher disease in a single center seems to be a function of increased awareness of this phenotype, rather than of geographic clustering. The actual incidence of lethal type 2 Gaucher disease may be underestimated, as many cases may have been misclassified as collodion babies or hydrops of unknown cause.	1
Hyperinsulinism of infancy: novel ABCC8 and KCNJ11 mutations and evidence for additional locus heterogeneity. ||  || Hyperinsulinism of infancy is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion resulting in severe hypoglycemia. To date, mutations in five different genes, the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1, ABCC8), the inward rectifying potassium channel (K(IR)6.2, KCNJ11), glucokinase (GCK), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1), and short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (SCHAD), have been implicated. Previous reports suggest that, in 40% of patients, no mutation can be identified in any of these genes, suggesting additional locus heterogeneity. However, previous studies did not screen all five genes using direct sequencing, the most sensitive technique available for mutation detection. We selected 15 hyperinsulinism of infancy patients and systematically sequenced the promoter and all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of ABCC8 and KCNJ11. If no mutation was identified, the coding sequence and intron/exon boundaries of GCK, GLUD1, and SCHAD were sequenced. Seven novel mutations were found in the ABCC8 coding region, one mutation was found in the KCNJ11 coding region, and one novel mutation was found in each of the two promoter regions screened. Functional studies on beta-cells from six patients showed abnormal ATP-sensitive K+ channel function in five of the patients; the sixth had normal channel activity, and no mutations were found. Photolabeling studies using a reconstituted system showed that all missense mutations altered intracellular trafficking. Each of the promoter mutations decreased expression of a reporter gene by about 60% in a heterologous expression system. In four patients (27%), no mutations were identified. Thus, further genetic heterogeneity is suggested in this disorder. These patients represent a cohort that can be used for searching for mutations in other candidate genes.	4 0 2
Adolescent non-adherence reveals a genetic cause for diabetes. ||  || Glucokinase related maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY) is a form of monogenic diabetes characterized by mildly elevated fasting blood sugars and HbA(1c) typically ranging from 38 to 60 mmol/mol (5.6-7.6%). It is frequently unrecognized or misdiagnosed as Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, resulting in unnecessary pharmacologic therapy. Two brothers were initially diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The brothers were maintained on a total daily insulin dose of 0.3-0.5 units/kg/day and had HbA(1c) values of 40-51 mmol/mol (5.8-6.8%) throughout childhood. After over 10 years of insulin treatment, the younger brother chose to discontinue his insulin therapy without informing his family or his clinician. Following cessation of insulin treatment, he did not experience any change in overall glycaemic control. Subsequent research-based genetic testing revealed a deleterious mutation in GCK in both brothers (p.Val182Met). The older brother subsequently discontinued insulin therapy and both have remained off all pharmacological therapy with good glycaemic control (HbA(1c) < 53 mmol/mol, < 7%) and no adverse complications. The family was advised to seek confirmatory genetic testing in the father and other relatives with hyperglycaemia. The family described above exemplifies the rationale behind considering a genetic cause when evaluating every person with new-onset hyperglycaemia or those with atypical diabetes. The cost of genetic testing for the most common MODY causing genes may be offset by savings made in therapeutic costs. It is important that all clinicians supervising diabetes care recognize the cardinal features that distinguish GCK-MODY from other forms of diabetes.	4 2
ETHE1 mutations are specific to ethylmalonic encephalopathy. ||  || Mutations in ETHE1, a gene located at chromosome 19q13, have recently been identified in patients affected by ethylmalonic encephalopathy (EE). EE is a devastating infantile metabolic disorder, characterised by widespread lesions in the brain, hyperlactic acidaemia, petechiae, orthostatic acrocyanosis, and high levels of ethylmalonic acid in body fluids. To investigate to what extent ETHE1 is responsible for EE, we analysed this gene in 29 patients with typical EE and in 11 patients presenting with early onset progressive encephalopathy with ethylmalonic aciduria (non-EE EMA). Frameshift, stop, splice site, and missense mutations of ETHE1 were detected in all the typical EE patients analysed. Western blot analysis of the ETHE1 protein indicated that some of the missense mutations are associated with the presence of the protein, suggesting that the corresponding wild type amino acid residues have a catalytic function. No ETHE1 mutations were identified in non-EE EMA patients. Experiments based on two dimensional blue native electrophoresis indicated that ETHE1 protein works as a supramolecular, presumably homodimeric, complex, and a three dimensional model of the protein suggests that it is likely to be a mitochondrial matrix thioesterase acting on a still unknown substrate. Finally, the 625G-->A single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding the short chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (SCAD) was previously proposed as a co-factor in the aetiology of EE and other EMA syndromes. SNP analysis in our patients ruled out a pathogenic role of SCAD variants in EE, but did show a highly significant prevalence of the 625A alleles in non-EE EMA patients.	1
Ethnicity and mutations in GJB2 (connexin 26) and GJB6 (connexin 30) in a multi-cultural Canadian paediatric Cochlear Implant Program. ||  || To determine the relationship between ethnicity and mutations in the GJB2 and GJB6 genes in multi-cultural patients enrolled in a Canadian paediatric Cochlear Implant Program. Blood was analyzed from 65 paediatric cochlear implant users by direct sequencing of the coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the GBJ2 gene. Individuals heterozygous for one mutation in GJB2 or in whom mutations in GJB2 were not detected were analyzed for the common 342 kb deletion mutation D13S1830 in the GJB6 gene. Information regarding ethnicity of patients' families was obtained from patient records and/or interview. GJB2 mutations were found in 36.9% of paediatric cochlear implant users tested. Nine different GJB2 mutations were identified among individuals from 14 different countries of origin. Seventy-eight percent of all identified pathogenic GJB2 mutations were 35delG. Biallelic GJB2 mutations were found in 16 cochlear implant users (66.7% of GJB2 mutations). Three novel GJB2 sequence changes were identified: (1) a missense mutation T107C (L36P) in an individual of African decent; (2) a missense mutation G475T (D159Y) in an individual of Caribbean decent; (3) a regulatory region change 1-34C to T in an individual of African decent. GJB6-D13S1830 mutations were not found in any of the patients tested. Individuals of African, Caribbean and East Indian decent had different GJB2 mutations than the remainder of individuals tested. Patients of Asian, Italian, Spanish, Polish and Armenian decent were not found to carry mutations in GJB2 or the common GJB6-D13S1830 mutation. This study represents the largest number of biallelic GJB2 mutations isolated in a group of paediatric cochlear implant users to date. Numerous and diverse GJB2 mutations were found in this multi-cultural group of children. Even though GJB2 mutations have been widely reported in the literature, this discussion represents the first report of GJB2 mutations in a multi-ethnic population (Canadian), as compared with previous studies that investigated fairly homogeneous populations. The diversity of GJB2 mutations identified reinforces the importance of testing for changes in GJB2 by direct sequencing of the entire coding region rather than testing only for common mutations.	1
Molecular characterization of phenylketonuria in South Brazil. ||  || Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. The PAH gene, located at 12q22-q24.1, includes about 90kb and contains 13 exons. To date, more than 420 different alterations have been identified in the PAH gene. To determine the nature and frequency of PAH mutations in PKU patients from South Brazil, mutation analysis was performed on genomic DNA from 23 unrelated PKU patients. The 13 exons and flanking regions of the PAH gene were amplified by PCR and the amplicons were analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Amplicons that showed abnormal migration patterns were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and/or sequencing. Twenty-two previously reported mutations were identified including R261X, R408W, IVS2nt5g-->c, R261Q, and V388M. Polymorphisms were observed in 48.8% of the PKU patients, the most frequent being IVS2nt19t-->c, V245V, and IVS12nt-35c-->t. In addition, two novel sequence variants were identified: 1378g-->t in the 3(')-untranslated region in exon 13 which may be disease-causing and an intron 12 polymorphism, IVS12nt-15t-->c. The mutation spectrum in the patients from Southern Brazil differed from that observed in patients from other Latin American countries and further defined the molecular heterogeneity of this disease.	3
Expression and functional characterization of mutated glucocerebrosidase alleles causing Gaucher disease in Spanish patients. ||  || Gaucher disease (GD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by an impaired activity of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. This heterogeneity is attributed in part to the existence of a large number of mutations in the corresponding gene. To establish genotype-phenotype relationships, we analyzed the residual enzyme activities of six naturally occurring mutations found in Spanish population in the glucocerebrosidase gene [c.160G > A (V15M), c.485T>C (M123T), c.914C>T (P266L), c.1124T>C (L336P), c.1207A>C (S364R) and c.1510-1512delTCT (S465del)]. The mutated genes were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCR 3.1 and expressed by transient transfection in COS cells. The enzymatic activity of the expressed protein were measured and compared with the wild-type human glucocerebrosidase cDNA. Also, two previously alleles, c.1226A>G (N370S) and c.1448T>C (L444P), were used for comparative purposes. The residual activity of the expressed proteins using the synthetic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 4MU-Glu) ranged from 5.5% (for the 3-bp deletion) to 42.7% (for S364R mutation) of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. The present analyses may help to better understand the molecular basis and the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease. However, results of expression of mutated enzymes are necessary but not sufficient to explain the ultimate clinical outcome of Gaucher disease.	4 2 0 1 3
Whole-Exome Sequencing Study of Extreme Phenotypes of NAFLD. ||  || Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a heterogeneous disease with highly variable outcomes. Patients with simple steatosis typically experience a benign course, whereas those with more advanced liver injury, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and advanced stage fibrosis suffer increased risk for complications such as cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and liver cancer. Genetic variants in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (<i>PNPLA3</i>) and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (<i>TM6SF2</i>) and clinical factors including diabetes, obesity, and older age increase a patient's risk for NASH, advanced fibrosis, and worse outcomes. Despite substantial investigation and identification of some common variants associated with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, the genetics and functional mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify genetic variants by whole-exome sequencing of NAFLD phenotypes to provide novel insights into mechanisms behind NAFLD pathogenesis and variability. We sequenced 82 patients with liver biopsy-confirmed NAFLD and 4455 population controls. NAFLD patients were divided into extreme phenotypes based on liver fibrosis stage and clinical risk factors to investigate rare variants that might predispose to or protect from advanced NAFLD fibrosis. We compared NAFLD extremes to each other and individually to population controls, exploring genetic variation at both the single-variant and gene-based level. We replicated known associations with <i>PNPLA3</i> and <i>TM6SF2</i> and advanced fibrosis, despite sample-size limitations. We also observed enrichment of variation in distinct genes for progressor or protective NAFLD phenotypes, although these genes did not reach statistical significance. <i>Conclusion</i>: We report the first whole-exome sequencing study of genetic variation in liver biopsy-confirmed NAFLD susceptibility and severity, using a small cohort of extreme NAFLD phenotypes and a large cohort of population controls.	4
The effect of LDLR-negative genotype on CT coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic statin treated patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. ||  || To evaluate the influence of LDL receptor (LDLR) -negative mutational status on CT coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic statin treated patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) was performed in 145 FH patients (93 men; mean age 52 ± 8) screened for LDLR and apolipoprotein B (APOB) mutations. The extent of coronary plaque was compared between two groups: 1) 59 patients (41%) heterozygous for LDLR-negative mutations (LDLR-negative) and 2) 86 patients (59%) with reduced or normal LDLR function (LDLR-positive) consisting of 32 LDLR-defective mutations, 8 APOB mutations and 46 patients in whom no mutation could be identified. The diseased segments score (DSS) was the primary study endpoint defined as the number of coronary artery segments (0-17) with >20% luminal diameter narrowing. We compared the DSS between LDLR-negative and LDLR-positive patients. Within the LDLR-positive group a secondary analysis was performed between identified (LDLR-defective, APOB) and unidentified mutational status. The median DSS was higher in LDLR-negative than in LDLR-positive patients (4 (1-7) and 2 (0-5); P = 0.017). After adjustment for risk factors, LDLR-negative mutational status remained an independent predictor of the DSS (B = 1.09; P = 0.047). The DSS in the LDLR-positive group was similar for patients with identified and patients with unidentified mutational status. In asymptomatic statin treated patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH, LDLR-negative mutational status is associated with a higher extent of subclinical CT coronary atherosclerosis.	4
Acid β-glucosidase mutants linked to Gaucher disease, Parkinson disease, and Lewy body dementia alter α-synuclein processing. ||  || Heterozygous mutations in the GBA1 gene elevate the risk of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies; both disorders are characterized by misprocessing of α-synuclein (SNCA). A loss in lysosomal acid-β-glucosidase enzyme (GCase) activity due to biallelic GBA1 mutations underlies Gaucher disease. We explored mechanisms for the gene's association with increased synucleinopathy risk. We analyzed the effects of wild-type (WT) and several GBA mutants on SNCA in cellular and in vivo models using biochemical and immunohistochemical protocols. We observed that overexpression of all GBA mutants examined (N370S, L444P, D409H, D409V, E235A, and E340A) significantly raised human SNCA levels to 121 to 248% of vector control (p < 0.029) in neural MES23.5 and PC12 cells, but without altering GCase activity. Overexpression of WT GBA in neural and HEK293-SNCA cells increased GCase activity, as expected (ie, to 167% in MES-SNCA, 128% in PC12-SNCA, and 233% in HEK293-SNCA; p < 0.002), but had mixed effects on SNCA. Nevertheless, in HEK293-SNCA cells high GCase activity was associated with SNCA reduction by ≤32% (p = 0.009). Inhibition of cellular GCase activity (to 8-20% of WT; p < 0.0017) did not detectably alter SNCA levels. Mutant GBA-induced SNCA accumulation could be pharmacologically reversed in D409V-expressing PC12-SNCA cells by rapamycin, an autophagy-inducer (≤40%; 10μM; p < 0.02). Isofagomine, a GBA chaperone, showed a related trend. In mice expressing two D409Vgba knockin alleles without signs of Gaucher disease (residual GCase activity, ≥20%), we recorded an age-dependent rise of endogenous Snca in hippocampal membranes (125% vs WT at 52 weeks; p = 0.019). In young Gaucher disease mice (V394Lgba+/+//prosaposin[ps]-null//ps-transgene), which demonstrate neurological dysfunction after age 10 weeks (GCase activity, ≤10%), we recorded no significant change in endogenous Snca levels at 12 weeks of age. However, enhanced neuronal ubiquitin signals and axonal spheroid formation were already present. The latter changes were similar to those seen in three week-old cathepsin D-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that GBA mutants promote SNCA accumulation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, thereby identifying a biochemical link between GBA1 mutation carrier status and increased synucleinopathy risk. In cell culture models, this gain of toxic function effect can be mitigated by rapamycin. Loss in GCase activity did not immediately raise SNCA concentrations, but first led to neuronal ubiquitinopathy and axonal spheroids, a phenotype shared with other lysosomal storage disorders.	0
Molecular diagnosis of PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS) in 162 patients and recommendations for genetic testing. ||  || Postzygotic activating mutations of PIK3CA cause a wide range of mosaic disorders collectively referred to as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). We describe the diagnostic yield and characteristics of PIK3CA sequencing in PROS. We performed ultradeep next-generation sequencing (NGS) of PIK3CA in various tissues from 162 patients referred to our clinical laboratory and assessed diagnostic yield by phenotype and tissue tested. We identified disease-causing mutations in 66.7% (108/162) of patients, with mutant allele levels as low as 1%. The diagnostic rate was higher (74%) in syndromic than in isolated cases (35.5%; P = 9.03 × 10<sup>-5</sup>). We identified 40 different mutations and found strong oncogenic mutations more frequently in patients without brain overgrowth (50.6%) than in those with brain overgrowth (15.2%; P = 0.00055). Mutant allele levels were higher in skin and overgrown tissues than in blood and buccal samples (P = 3.9 × 10<sup>-25</sup>), regardless of the phenotype. Our data demonstrate the value of ultradeep NGS for molecular diagnosis of PROS, highlight its substantial allelic heterogeneity, and confirm that optimal diagnosis requires fresh skin or surgical samples from affected regions. Our findings may be of value in guiding future recommendations for genetic testing in PROS and other mosaic conditions.Genet Med advance online publication 02 February 2017.	4
Mutation analysis in 46 British and Irish patients with Gaucher's disease. ||  || DNA from 46 unrelated patients with Gaucher's disease was analysed for 10 known mutations: 84GG(c84 G 85ins), N370S (c1226G), L444P (c1448C), R463C (c1504T), R496H (c1604A), IVS2+1, D409H (c1342C), RecNcil (c1448C-1498C), RecTL (c1342C-1498C), and c1263del (c1264-1318del). Fifty four mutations (90%) were identified in 30 patients with type I disease. These included a previously undescribed recombinant mutation RecA456P (c1448C-1484C). Thirteen (54%) of 24 type II alleles were identified, including one new point mutation N462K (c1503G) and one new 55bp deletion also incorporating the RecTL mutations c1263del+RecTL (c1264del-1498C). All four type III patients were homozygous for the L444P point mutation. Generally, patients with one copy of the N370S mutation had mild adult onset disease, regardless of the nature of their second mutation. Three exceptions had childhood onset disease and genotypes N370S/R463C, N370S/RecA456P, and N370S/?. The L444P/L444P genotype was thought to be associated with neurological disease. Two type I patients with this genotype who exhibited no central nervous system disease were identified, however. The R463C and c1263del mutations were found to be present at a higher frequency than reported in other populations and they should be included in any mutation screen of this population. The recombinant mutations RecA456P and c1263del+RecTL have not been previously described and are the fourth and fifth recombinant mutations identified in the glucocerebrosidase gene.	1 4
Improvement in Bone Mineral Density and Architecture in a Patient with Gaucher Disease Using Teriparatide. ||  || Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme acid beta-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase) due to mutations in the GBA gene. The most common form (type I) is associated with severe hematologic, visceral and bone disease. Disease-modifying treatments, such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy, can improve the hematologic and visceral aspects of the disease but success with improving severe osteopenia, which can increase the risk of fractures, is limited. Our case involves a patient with complex disease affecting bone health including Gaucher disease (type I), Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and corticosteroid use who did not respond to long term use of bisphosphonates. We report an improvement in bone mineral density and bone architecture commensurate with a reduced incidence of fractures in whom we used teriparatide (human parathyroid hormone (PTH; 1-34) to treat severe osteopenia. We conclude that teriparatide should be considered for further studies as an agent to improve bone mineral density in patients with Gaucher disease.	1 4 3
Genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in Han Chinese. || Chinese Familial hypercholesterolemia Genetics Low-density lipoprotein receptor Mutation || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder of lipoprotein metabolism resulting in elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which lead to increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease. The recognized cause is mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. This study reviewed the literature in Han Chinese to investigate the frequency and spectrum of mutations that are recognized by molecular genetics as causes of FH, the clinical characteristics, and mutation detection rates of FH. MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Wanfang, CNKI, and FH websites, were reviewed through December 2014. Sixty-six studies met inclusion criteria. Totally, 143 different LDLR mutations were identified, including 134 point mutations and 9 large rearrangements; functional characteristics of 46 point mutations were studied. The 5 most frequent mutations included APOB 10579C>T, LDLR 986G>A, 1747C>T, 1879G>A, and 268G>A. Most of these mutations were reported in Southeast China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. DNA detection rates of heterozygous FH were 6.5% to 77.5%, depending on the inclusion criteria and chosen screening method. With the economic growth and Western-like diet patterns being adopted over the past decade in municipalities in mainland China and Taiwan, the mean pretreatment concentration of LDL-C is higher among heterozygous FH patients reported since 2005 than in patients reported before 2005 (231 vs 196 mg/dL, P < .001). This review of DNA data for Han Chinese patients with FH updates the frequency and spectrum of FH scenarios. Large-scale investigations are needed to determine the interactions between mutations and LDL-C level in relation to cardiovascular risk assessment and management.	4
Complex alleles of the acid beta-glucosidase gene in Gaucher disease. ||  || Gaucher disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease. Gaucher disease has marked phenotypic variation and molecular heterogeneity, and seven point mutations in the acid beta-glucosidase (beta-Glc) gene have been identified. By means of sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSO), mutation 6433C has been detected homozygously in neuronopathic type 2 (acute) and type 3 (subacute) patients, as well as in children with severe visceral involvement who are apparently free of neuronopathic disease. To investigate the molecular basis for this puzzling finding, amplified beta-Glc cDNAs from 6433C homozygous type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease patients were cloned and sequenced. The Swedish type 3 Gaucher disease patient was truly homozygous for alleles only containing the 6433C mutation. In comparison, the type 2 patient contained a singly mutated 6433C allele and a "complex" allele with multiple discrete point mutations (6433C, 6468C, and 6482C). Each of the mutations in the complex allele also was present in the beta-Glc pseudogene. SSO hybridization of 6433C homozygotes revealed that both type 2 patients contained additional mutations in one allele, whereas the 6433C alone was detected in both type 3 and in young severe type 1 Gaucher disease patients. These results suggest that the presence of the complex allele influences the severity of neuronopathic disease in 6433C homozygotes and reveal the central role played by the pseudogene in the formation of mutant alleles of the beta-Glc gene. Analysis of additional cDNA clones also identified two new alleles in a type 3 patient, emphasizing the molecular heterogeneity of neuronopathic Gaucher disease.	4
Update of the Portuguese Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Study. ||  || The main aim of the Portuguese Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Study is to identify the genetic cause of hypercholesterolaemia in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH). A total of 1340 blood samples were collected from 482 index patients and 858 relatives with the collaboration of clinicians from several hospitals all over the country. The genetic diagnosis of FH in this study is based on the analyses of three genes: LDLR, APOB and PCSK9. In the last 10 years, the Portuguese FH Study identified a genetic defect in a total of 171 index patients, corresponding to an overall of 48% of the total received cases with clinical diagnosis of FH. Although the Simon Broome FH register criteria have been adapted to our study, 59 patients that did not fulfil all criteria were included in the study and a mutation causing disease was identified in 8 of these patients. In the LDLR gene were found 80 different mutations in 165 unrelated index patients: 159 heterozygous, 3 compounds heterozygous and 3 true homozygous. The APOB p.Arg3527Gln and the PCSK9 p.Asp374His mutation were not found in any of our patients since our last report, but a novel mutation in the APOB gene, predicted to cause a single amino acid substitution p.Tyr3560Cys, was found in one patient. The cascade screening in relatives of these 171 index patients allowed the identification and genetic characterization of a total of 404 FH patients in Portugal.	4
Molecular analysis of chylomicronemia in a clinical laboratory setting: diagnosis of 13 cases of lipoprotein lipase deficiency. || Apolipoprotein A-V GPIHBP1 LPL Severe hypertriglyceridemia Type I hyperlipidemia Type V hyperlipidemia || Familial chylomicronemia (type I hyperlipidemia) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due mainly to rare variants in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene sequence. Molecular diagnosis of LPL deficiency is now a requirement for the first gene therapy treatment approved in the European Union. Altered coding sequence variants in APOC2, APOA5 or GPIHBP-1 can also cause familial chylomicronemia. Herein, we report the results of our molecular diagnostic activity in this topic, carried out in the setting of a Spanish clinical practice hospital laboratory, which was also extended to some patients who were more likely to have type V hyperlipidemia. Samples from twenty-nine unrelated probands with severe hypertriglyceridemia were referred for molecular diagnosis. Samples were first screened for LPL sequence variants by DNA sequencing and, in the absence of alterations, subsequent analysis of APOC2, APOA5, and GPIHBP1 genes was undertaken. Analysis of LPL function in vitro was further studied in two previously uncharacterized LPL sequence variants. Fourteen different, loss-of-function variants were found in the LPL gene: 4 were novel or uncharacterized allelic variants, and of these, 2 were directly shown to affect function. Twenty of 29 probands presented at least one LPL gene allele variant: 8 were homozygous, 9 compound heterozygous and 3 heterozygous. In 13 probands, the finding of two loss-of-function variants supported the diagnosis of LPL deficiency. None of the probands presented sequence variants in the APOC2 gene, whereas 3 presented rare variants within the APOA5 gene. Four of the five patients heterozygous for a common variant in the GPIHBP-1 gene also carried APOA5 sequence variants. Loss-of-function LPL variants leading to familial chylomicronemia were found in 13 patients, accounting for a significant proportion of the LPL-deficient patients predicted to live in Spain.	4
Differential regulation of serum microRNA expression by HNF1β and HNF1α transcription factors. || HNF MODY Monogenic diabetes Transcription factors microRNA || We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) under transcriptional control of the HNF1β transcription factor, and investigate whether its effect manifests in serum. The Polish cohort (N = 60) consisted of 11 patients with HNF1B-MODY, 17 with HNF1A-MODY, 13 with GCK-MODY, an HbA1c-matched type 1 diabetic group (n = 9) and ten healthy controls. Replication was performed in 61 clinically-matched British patients mirroring the groups in the Polish cohort. The Polish cohort underwent miRNA serum level profiling with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) arrays to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Validation was performed using qPCR. To determine whether serum content reflects alterations at a cellular level, we quantified miRNA levels in a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) with small interfering RNA knockdowns of HNF1α or HNF1β. Significant differences (adjusted p < 0.05) were noted for 11 miRNAs. Five of them differed between HNF1A-MODY and HNF1B-MODY, and, amongst those, four (miR-24, miR-27b, miR-223 and miR-199a) showed HNF1B-MODY-specific expression levels in the replication group. In all four cases the miRNA expression level was lower in HNF1B-MODY than in all other tested groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.79 to 0.86, with sensitivity and specificity reaching 91.7% (miR-24) and 82.1% (miR-199a), respectively. The cellular expression pattern of miRNA was consistent with serum levels, as all were significantly higher in HNF1α- than in HNF1β-deficient HepG2 cells. We have shown that expression of specific miRNAs depends on HNF1β function. The impact of HNF1β deficiency was evidenced at serum level, making HNF1β-dependent miRNAs potentially applicable in the diagnosis of HNF1B-MODY.	4
Digenic inheritance of deafness caused by 8J allele of myosin-VIIA and mutations in other Usher I genes. ||  || Inherited hearing loss in mice has contributed substantially to our understanding of inner-ear function. We identified a new allele at the Myo7a locus, Myo7a(sh1-8J); genomic characterization indicated that Myo7a(sh1-8J) arose from complex deletion encompassing exons 38-40 and 42-46. Homozygous mutant mice had no detectable auditory brainstem response, displayed highly disorganized hair-cell stereocilia and had no detectable MYO7A protein. We generated mice that were digenic heterozygotes for Myo7a(sh1-8J) and one of each Cdh23(v-2J), Ush1g(js) or Pcdh15(av-3J) alleles, or an Ush1c null allele. Significant levels of age-related hearing loss were detected in +/Myo7a(sh1-8J) +/Ush1g(js), +/Myo7a(sh1-8J) +/Cdh23(v-2J) and +/Myo7a(sh1-8J) +/Pcdh15(av-3J) double heterozygous mice compared with age-matched single heterozygous animals, suggesting epistasis between Myo7a and each of the three loci. +/Pcdh15(av-3J) +/Ush1g(js) double heterozygous mice also showed elevated hearing loss, suggesting Pcdh15-Ush1g epistasis. While we readily detected MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23 and PCDH15 using mass spectrometry of purified chick utricle hair bundles, we did not detect USH1G. Consistent with that observation, Ush1g microarray signals were much lower in chick cochlea than those of Myo7a, Ush1c, Cdh23 and Pcdh15 and were not detected in the chick utricle. These experiments confirm the importance of MYO7A for the development and maintenance of bundle function and support the suggestion that MYO7A, USH1G (Sans) and CDH23 form the upper tip-link complex in adult mice, likely in combination with USH1C (harmonin). MYO7A, USH1G and PCDH15 may form another complex in stereocilia. USH1G may be a limiting factor in both complexes.	1
Novel mutations in type 2 Gaucher disease in Chinese and their functional characterization by heterologous expression. ||  || We investigated 10 unrelated Chinese patients with type 2 Gaucher disease and performed ex vivo expression for the novel mutations to characterize their functional defects. These patients were diagnosed by enzymatic assays and clinicopathologic features over the past five years in a national centre in China. Genomic DNA was sequenced by a two-stage PCR approach for mutations in the functional GBA gene. Novel mutations were expressed with baculovirus-transfected Sf21 cells. Six novel mutations were found (in traditional nomenclature): P122L, Y363C, N382K, L383R, L385P, and M416V. Review of reported mutations indicated clustering of type 2 mutations in three regions of the GBA gene. Expression of novel mutations revealed that the enzyme defect could arise from one of two mechanisms: loss of catalytic activity (Y363C and M416V) or enzyme instability (P122L and N382K).	1 4 3
Clinical versus molecular diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in the diverse South African population. ||  || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic disease characterised by strikingly elevated plasma cholesterol concentration, which can lead to premature coronary death if left untreated. In this study DNA diagnosis of FH, which allows detection before onset of clinical symptoms, was evaluated against biochemical parameters routinely used to identify subjects with FH. A population-based strategy was used to identify low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene defects in South Africans with clinical signs of FH, followed by a family-based DNA screening approach for presymptomatic diagnosis of FH. DNA screening of 790 at-risk relatives for the FH-related mutations identified in 379 index cases, allowed accurate disease diagnosis in an additional 338 relatives and exclusion of the relevant mutation in 452 individuals. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis, based on total cholesterol values measured in family members of FH heterozygous index cases with one of the three founder-related mutations, D154N, D206E and V408M, were 89.3% and 81.9%, respectively. The predominance of 10 LDLR gene mutations in the local population justifies population-directed DNA diagnosis of FH in South Africa on a routine basis, particularly since expression of the defective gene measured in biochemical tests does not allow accurate diagnosis of FH in all cases. DNA testing provides a definitive tool for family tracing aimed at pre-clinical diagnosis and preventive treatment of FH.	4
Perioperative management of a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a case report. ||  || : We report herein the successful perioperative management of a 57-year-old man with a type I Glanzmann thrombasthenia undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and right carotid endarterectomy. The patient suffered from several lesions in the three major coronary arteries and in the right carotid necessitating surgery. Prophylactic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched platelets transfusions were continuous administrated before, and through the immediate perioperative period. Posttransfusion platelet recovery was monitored using flow cytometry to determine the percentage of circulating platelet expressing CD61 (β3). No bleeding complications occurred during and following the procedure. The patient did not develop HLA antibodies or αIIbβ3 antibodies. Thrombophilia screening revealed a heterozygous G20210A prothrombin gene mutation. The patient also suffered from an atrial fibrillation, necessitating anticoagulation therapy. During the hospital stay, a treatment with vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention was initiated. The patient was discharged 8 days following surgery, and no further complications occurred during the 6 months follow-up.	1 3
Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in The Cancer Genome Atlas. || PanCanAtlas TCGA cancer genome atlas cancer genomics combination therapy pan-cancer precision oncology signaling pathways therapeutics whole exome sequencing || Genetic alterations in signaling pathways that control cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and cell growth are common hallmarks of cancer, but the extent, mechanisms, and co-occurrence of alterations in these pathways differ between individual tumors and tumor types. Using mutations, copy-number changes, mRNA expression, gene fusions and DNA methylation in 9,125 tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we analyzed the mechanisms and patterns of somatic alterations in ten canonical pathways: cell cycle, Hippo, Myc, Notch, Nrf2, PI-3-Kinase/Akt, RTK-RAS, TGFβ signaling, p53 and β-catenin/Wnt. We charted the detailed landscape of pathway alterations in 33 cancer types, stratified into 64 subtypes, and identified patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity. Eighty-nine percent of tumors had at least one driver alteration in these pathways, and 57% percent of tumors had at least one alteration potentially targetable by currently available drugs. Thirty percent of tumors had multiple targetable alterations, indicating opportunities for combination therapy.	4
Glucocerebrosidase mutations in subjects with parkinsonism. ||  || Recent studies showing an association between glucocerebrosidase deficiency and parkinsonism in Gaucher disease prompted an examination of the glucocerebrosidase gene sequence (GBA) and enzyme activity in brain samples from 57 subjects carrying the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Alterations in GBA were identified in 12 samples (21%) and were more frequent among the younger subjects. These included eight with mutations (N370S, L444P, K198T, and R329C) and four with probable polymorphisms (T369M and E326K). Our findings suggest that mutations in glucocerebrosidase may be a risk factor for the development of parkinsonism.	0
Rare variants in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene are common in hypertriglyceridemia but rare in Type III hyperlipidemia. ||  || Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have shown that variation in the lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) is associated with plasma triglyceride levels but that common variants account for only 1.25% of the variance. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of rare variants in the LPL gene in patients with various forms of hypertriglyceridemia. The DNA sequence of the exons plus exon/intron boundaries of the LPL gene of 313 patients with triglycerides above the 95th percentile for age and sex (107 of whom had triglycerides above 875 mg/dl) and 121 patients with Type III hyperlipidemia was determined. Twenty rare variants were detected of which seven have been previously reported. All of the rare variants were present as heterozygotes. Sixteen were missense mutations, two were short deletion mutants and there were single nonsense and insertion mutations. Fifteen of the missense mutations resulted in an amino acid change. There were 13 patients (12.1%) with triglycerides above 875 mg/dl and 10 patients (4.9%) with moderately elevated triglycerides, who were carriers of at least one rare, non-synonymous mutation in the LPL gene. Of the patients with Type III HLP, two were carriers of rare variants. Rare mutations in the LPL gene are frequent in patients with elevated triglycerides.	4
Prevalence of nine mutations among Jewish and non-Jewish Gaucher disease patients. ||  || The frequency of nine different mutated alleles known to occur in the glucocerebrosidase gene was determined in 247 Gaucher patients, of whom 176 were of Jewish extraction, 2 were Jewish with one converted parent, and 69 were of non-Jewish origin. DNA was prepared from peripheral blood, active glucocerebrosidase sequences were amplified by using the PCR technique, and the mutations were identified by using the allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization method. The N37OS mutation appeared in 69.77% of the mutated alleles in Jewish patients and in 22.86% of the mutated alleles in non-Jews. The 84GG mutation, which has not been found so far among non-Jewish patients, existed in 10.17% of the disease alleles among Jewish patients. The IVS + 1 mutation constituted 2.26% of the disease alleles among Jewish patients and 1.43% among the non-Jewish patients. RecTL, a complex allele containing four single-base-pair changes, occurred in 2.26% of the alleles in Jewish patients and was found in two (1.43%) of the patients of non-Jewish extraction. Another complex allele, designated "RecNciI" and containing three single-point mutations, appeared in 7.8% of alleles of non-Jewish patients and in only two (0.56%) of the Jewish families. The prevalence of the L444P mutation among non-Jewish Gaucher patients was 31.43%, while its prevalence among Jewish patients was only 4.24%. The prevalence of two other point mutations--D409H and R463C--was 5.00% and 3.57%, respectively, among non-Jewish patients and was not found among the Jewish Gaucher patient population. The prevalence of the R496H mutation, found so far only among Jewish patients, was 1.13%. The results presented demonstrate that seven mutations identify 90.40% of the mutations among Jewish patients and that these seven mutations allow diagnosis of only 73.52% of the non-Jewish patients. Identification of additional mutant alleles will enhance the accuracy of carrier detection.	1 4 2
Pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 transcriptional activation requires interactions with p300. ||  || The homeodomain transcription factor, pancreas duodenum homeobox (PDX)-1, is essential for pancreas development, insulin production, and glucose homeostasis. Mutations in pdx-1(ipf-1) are associated both with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and type 2 diabetes. PDX-1 interacts with multiple transcription factors and coregulators, including the coactivator p300, to activate the transcription of the insulin gene and other target genes within pancreatic beta-cells. In characterizing the protein-protein interactions of PDX-1 and p300, we identified mutations in PDX-1 that disrupt its function and are associated with increased or decreased interactions with p300. Several mutant PDX-1 proteins that are associated with heritable forms of diabetes in humans, in particular the mutant P63fsdelC, exhibited increased binding to a carboxy-terminal segment of p300 in the setting of decreased DNA-binding activities, suggesting that sequestration of p300 by mutant PDX-1 proteins may be an additional mechanism by which insulin gene expression is reduced in heterozygous carriers of pdx-1(ipf-1) mutations. The introduction of the point mutations S66A/Y68A in the highly conserved amino-terminal PDX-1 transactivation domain reduced the ability of PDX-1 to interact with p300, substantially diminished the transcriptional activation of PDX-1, and reduced the synergistic activation of glucose-responsive insulin promoter enhancer sequences by PDX-1, E12, and E47. We propose that interactions of PDX-1 with p300 are required for the transcriptional activation of PDX-1 target genes. Impairment of interactions between PDX-1 and p300 in pancreatic beta-cells may limit insulin production and lead to the development of diabetes.	0
Glucocerebrosidase gene variants are accumulated in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder. || Dementia with Lewy bodies Glucocerebrosidase variants Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep disorder Parkinson's disease || Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene variants are associated with the development of the Lewy body disorders (LBD) Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) represents prodromal LBD in most instances. We investigated whether GBA variants are overrepresented in IRBD and if their presence shortens the time to conversion to clinically-defined LBD. All GBA coding exons from 69 polysomnography-confirmed IRBD patients and 84 matched controls were sequenced by the Sanger method. Seven missense variants (E326K, L444P, A446T, A318G, R329C, T369M, N370S) were identified in eight (11.6%) IRBD patients and in one (1.2%) control (P = 0.026). After a mean follow-up of 8.9 ± 3.8 years from IRBD diagnosis, five subjects with GBA variants developed LBD (3 DLB and 2 PD) and three remained disease-free. The risk of developing a LBD was similar in IRBD subjects with GBA variants than in those without variants (log rank test, p = 0.935). In IRBD, GBA variants are 1) more frequent when compared to controls, 2) associated with impending PD and DLB but 3) not indicative of a short-term risk for LBD after IRBD diagnosis. IRBD patients carrying GBA variants could be studied with disease-modifying interventions aiming to restore the GBA metabolic pathway.	4
Clinicogenetic study of GBA mutations in patients with familial Parkinson's disease. || Dementia GBA Gaucher disease Parkinson's disease Parkinsonism || The glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) is a known risk factor of Parkinson's disease (PD). We sequenced entire coding exons and exon/intron boundaries of GBA in 147 Japanese familial PD (FPD) patients from 144 families and 100 unrelated control subjects. Twenty-seven of 144 (18.8%) of index patients were heterozygous for known Gaucher disease mutations, suggesting that GBA heterozygous mutations are strongly associated with FPD (odds ratio = 22.9, 95% confidence interval = 3.1-171.2). The frequency was significantly higher in autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) compared with autosomal recessive PD. According to clinical assessments, PD patients with GBA mutations exhibited typical manifestations of PD or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), such as L-dopa responsive parkinsonism with psychiatric problems and/or cognitive decline. Interestingly, they also presented with reduced myocardial (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake. Our findings suggest that heterozygous GBA mutations are strong risk factors in FPD, especially for autosomal dominant PD. Some patients with GBA heterozygous mutations develop clinical features of DLB. We speculate that GBA dysfunction may promote Lewy body formation, resulting in more severe PD or DLB phenotypes that are inherited in families.	4
Alleles with more than one mutation can complicate genotype/phenotype studies in Mendelian disorders: Lessons from Gaucher disease. || Gaucher disease Genotype phenotype correlation Glucocerebrosidase Sequencing || Autosomal resessive Mendelian disorders usually result from two inherited disease-causing mutations. However, this is not always the case. Focusing on Gaucher disease, which results from mutations in GBA1, we found that more comprehensive genotyping revealed important exceptions. For example, patients with uniparental disomy or new mutations do not inherit a mutation from each parent. Furthermore, we identified patients found to carry more than one GBA1 mutation on the same allele. It is essential to examine the entire GBA1 gene in order to establish an accurate genotype. Missing the second mutation can complicate genotype/phenotype studies and result in improper genetic counseling.	1
