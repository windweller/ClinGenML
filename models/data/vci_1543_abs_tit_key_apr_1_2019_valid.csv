Prevalence, clinical significance, and genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with restrictive phenotype. || Adult Age Distribution Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Restrictive Cohort Studies Confidence Intervals Female Gene Expression Regulation Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genotype Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Prevalence Probability Prognosis Retrospective Studies Sarcomeres Sex Distribution Survival Analysis || The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, clinical significance, and genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with "restrictive phenotype" characterized by restrictive filling and minimal or no left ventricular hypertrophy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous myocardial disorder with a broad spectrum of clinical presentation and morphologic features. Recent reports indicated that some patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is an uncommon condition defined by restrictive filling and reduced diastolic volumes with normal or near normal left ventricular wall thickness and contractile function, have features suggestive of HCM with mutations in cardiac troponin I, myocyte disarray at explant/autopsy, and relatives with HCM. Systematic evaluation of the restrictive phenotype in HCM patients has not been performed. We evaluated 1,226 patients from 688 consecutive HCM families to identify individuals who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for "restrictive phenotype." Nineteen of 1,226 affected individuals (1.5%) from 16 families (2.3%) had the "restrictive phenotype." During follow up (53.7 +/- 49.2 months), 17 patients (89%) experienced dyspnea (New York Heart Association functional class > or =2). The 5-year survival rate from all-cause mortality, cardiac transplantation, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator discharge was 56.4%. Mutation analysis for 5 sarcomere genes was feasible in 15 of 16 probands. Mutations were found in 8: 4 in beta-myosin heavy chain, and 4 in cardiac troponin I. The "restrictive phenotype" in isolation is an uncommon presentation of the clinical spectrum of HCM and is associated with severe limitation and poor prognosis. This phenotype may be associated with beta-myosin heavy chain and cardiac troponin I mutations.	4
Glycogenosome accumulation in the arrector pili muscle in Pompe disease. || Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal Myocytes, Smooth Muscle alpha-Glucosidases || Glycogenosis type II or Pompe disease is an autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disease due to mutations in the gene encoding acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme required for lysosomal glycogen degradation. The disease predominantly affects the skeletal and respiratory muscles but there is growing evidence of the involvement of smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls, suggesting a multi-system disorder. Moreover, the failure of autophagy in Pompe disease could contribute to muscular atrophy and disease progression and is thought to compromise the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We investigated the light microscopical and ultrastructural pathology of the arrector pili muscle from punch skin biopsies from the calf of 6 adult Pompe disease patients and 6 age and gender matched healthy controls. Two patients had a follow-up biopsy after 19 and 20 month of ERT. The electron microscopic investigation of patient biopsies revealed the widespread occurrence of glycogenosomes, membrane bound accumulations of granular glycogen, associated with autophagic vacuoles. In the controls we detected only muscle cells with non-membrane bound forms of glycogen. These morphological changes in smooth muscle cells are similar to those seen in skeletal muscle and smooth muscle cells of arterioles of Pompe patients. Furthermore, two patients with pre- and post-ERT skin biopsies showed a decrease in the number of cells with extensive autophagy after treatment. Electron microscopic examination of the arrector pili muscles appears to be a surrogate marker for the involvement of smooth muscles reflecting disease severity. These findings suggest that the standardized and widely used skin biopsy could offer a minimally invasive way to screen for smooth muscle involvement and warrant further studies in larger cohorts of patients.	3 1
Familial hypercholesterolaemia in Portugal. || Adolescent Adult Apolipoproteins B Child Cholesterol Chromosome Segregation Female Haplotypes Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Middle Aged Mutation Pedigree Portugal Proprotein Convertase 9 Proprotein Convertases Receptors, LDL Serine Endopeptidases || Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is characterised clinically by an increased level of circulating LDL cholesterol that leads to lipid accumulation in tendons and arteries, premature atherosclerosis and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Although Portugal should have about 20,000 cases, this disease is severely under-diagnosed in our country, this being the first presentation of Portuguese data on FH. A total of 602 blood samples were collected from 184 index patients and 418 relatives from several centres throughout Portugal. Fifty-three different mutations were found in 83 index patients, 79 heterozygous and 4 with two defective LDLR alleles. Additionally, 4 putative alterations were found in 8 patients but were not considered mutations causing disease, mainly because they did not co-segregate with hypercholesterolaemia in the families. Three unrelated patients were found to be heterozygous for the APOB(3500) mutation and two unrelated patients were found to be heterozygous for a novel mutation in PCSK9, predicted to cause a single amino acid substitution, D374H. Cascade screening increased the number of FH patients identified genetically to 204. The newly identified FH patients are now receiving counselling and treatment based on the genetic diagnosis. The early identification of FH patients can increase their life expectancy and quality of life by preventing the development of premature CHD if patients receive appropriate pharmacological treatment.	2 4
Cone responses in Usher syndrome types 1 and 2 by microvolt electroretinography. || Usher genes Usher syndrome cone function microvolt electroretinogram || Progressive decline of psychophysical cone-mediated measures has been reported in type 1 (USH1) and type 2 (USH2) Usher syndrome. Conventional cone electroretinogram (ERG) responses in USH demonstrate poor signal-to-noise ratio. We evaluated cone signals in USH1 and USH2 by recording microvolt level cycle-by-cycle (CxC) ERG. Responses of molecularly genotyped USH1 (n = 18) and USH2 (n = 24) subjects (age range, 15-69 years) were compared with those of controls (n = 12). A subset of USH1 (n = 9) and USH2 (n = 9) subjects was examined two to four times over 2 to 8 years. Photopic CxC ERG and conventional 30-Hz flicker ERG were recorded on the same visits. Usher syndrome subjects showed considerable cone flicker ERG amplitude losses and timing phase delays (P < 0.01) compared with controls. USH1 and USH2 had similar rates of progressive logarithmic ERG amplitude decline with disease duration (-0.012 log Î¼V/y). Of interest, ERG phase delays did not progress over time. Two USH1C subjects retained normal response timing despite reduced amplitudes. The CxC ERG method provided reliable responses in all subjects, whereas conventional ERG was undetectable in 7 of 42 subjects. Cycle-by-cycle ERG showed progressive loss of amplitude in both USH1 and USH2 subjects, comparable to that reported with psychophysical measures. Usher subjects showed abnormal ERG response latency, but this changed less than amplitude with time. In USH syndrome, CxC ERG is more sensitive than conventional ERG and warrants consideration as an outcome measure in USH treatment trials.	1
Recurrent nonsense mutation in exon 7 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. || Arginine Codon Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific Exons Germany Haplotypes Humans Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length Turkey || A new mutation (CGA to TGA) in codon 261 of exon 7 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene transforms Arg261 to a stop codon in two unrelated patients of German and Turkish origin. The different ethnic backgrounds and the different polymorphic characteristics of the two mutant alleles suggest an independent origin of the mutation. This is the second defect detected in codon 261 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, a codon that thus appears to be a mutation hot spot.	3
Molecular and functional analysis of a novel MEK2 mutation in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome: transmission through four generations. || Abnormalities, Multiple Adult Base Sequence Cell Line Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Facies Family Characteristics Female Heart Defects, Congenital Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Inheritance Patterns MAP Kinase Kinase 2 Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutant Proteins Mutation Pedigree Pregnancy Syndrome || Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is one of the RASopathies and is caused by alteration of activity through the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway due to heterozygous de novo mutations in protein kinases BRAF, MEK1, or MEK2. CFC is a rare multiple congenital anomaly disorder in which individuals have characteristic dysmorphic features, cardiac defects, ectodermal anomalies and developmental delay.We report a 7(1/2)-month-old boy with a clinical diagnosis of CFC. Bidirectional sequence analysis of MEK2 revealed a novel c.383C-->A transversion in exon 3 resulting in a nonsynonymous missense substitution, p.P128Q. Other family members, including the proband's mother and half-sibling, displayed phenotypic features of CFC and were also screened for the MEK2 mutation identified in the proband. Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) analysis determined the novel MEK2 p.P128Q to be deleterious. To corroborate the functional alteration of the novel mutant protein, transient transfection of HEK 293T cells with subsequent Western analysis was used to demonstrate increased kinase activity, as measured by ERK phosphorylation. This first reported case of a vertically transmitted functional CFC MEK mutation further expands our understanding of germline mutations within the Ras/MAPK pathway.	0
[Severe form of juvenile type II glycogenosis in a compound-heterozygous boy (Tyr-292--> Cys/Arg-854-->Stop)]. ||  || Type II glycogenosis is a glycogen storage disease inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. This molecular and clinically heterogeneous condition is due to a deficiency in a lysosomal acid 1,4-alpha-glucosidase. To report the clinical, enzymatic and molecular characterization of a mulatto child, born to healthy Dominican mother and Caucasian father, affected by the juvenile phenotype form of type II glycogenosis. This 16-month-old male presented from 10 months with motor delay, limb-girdle hypotonia, prominence of calves, increased CPK value, mixed myotonic/myopathic pattern on EMG, intense glycogen muscle storage (775 micrograms/mg of protein) and severe deficiency of 1,4-alpha-glucosidase activity (< 0.03 mU/mg of protein). At 24 months he developed a rapidly progressive hypotonia and respiratory failure. The patient was found to be compound heretozygote for the novel mutation Tyr-292-->Cys, coming from the father, and Arg-854-->Stop, coming from the mother and previously reported in two Afroamerican patients, one with the adult phenotype and the other with the juvenile one. The present case corresponds to a severe form of type II juvenile glycogenosis. The severity of this condition may be related to the observed mutations and the associated extremely low muscle enzymatic activity.	1
Thyroid nodules and cancer in children with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome. || Adenocarcinoma, Follicular Adenoma Child Female Hamartoma Syndrome, Multiple Humans Male Thyroid Nodule || Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) is a complex disorder caused by germline-inactivating mutations of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Carriers develop benign and malignant tumors of multiple tissues, including the breast, thyroid, intestine, and skin. Surveillance to facilitate the early detection and treatment of malignancies is recommended but, because thyroid cancers have been reported almost exclusively in adults, childhood risk is considered to be low, and consensus guidelines recommend that surveillance imaging begin at 18 yr of age. Seven children with PHTS referred to two thyroidologists form the basis of this report. Medical records, operative histology, and PTEN mutational analysis were reviewed to evaluate the pediatric presentation of PHTS-associated thyroid neoplasia. Five of the seven children presented with thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer between the ages of 6 and 12 yr, often as the initially identified component of their PHTS. Two others were diagnosed with PHTS on the basis of extrathyroidal features but had markedly abnormal screening ultrasounds with solid thyroid nodule(s) of at least 2 cm, despite the documentation of normal physical examinations. Five of the seven children in this cohort developed thyroid cancer. Patients with PHTS can develop thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in early childhood. This argues both for a high index of suspicion for PHTS in children diagnosed with multiple thyroid nodules and for careful thyroid surveillance in children diagnosed with PHTS. Because early detection improves the outcome of thyroid cancer, we recommend ultrasound surveillance for all patients upon the confirmation of a germline PTEN mutation, regardless of their age.	2 4 3
Prevalence of Anderson-Fabry disease in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: the European Anderson-Fabry Disease survey. || Aged Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cross-Sectional Studies Europe Fabry Disease Female Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Prevalence alpha-Galactosidase || The prevalence of Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) in patients presenting with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of AFD in a large, consecutive cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using rapid mutation screening. A European multicentre cross-sectional study involving 13 referral centres. Inclusion criteria for the study were: men aged at least 35 years and women aged at least 40 years with unexplained LVH (maximum left ventricular wall thickness â¥ 1.5 cm). All patients were screened using a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography protocol for rapid mutation screening of the Î±-galactosidase A (Î±-Gal A) gene and, if a sequence variant was found, direct sequencing was performed. 1386 patients (63.9% men, mean age 57.9 Â± 12.0 years) were enrolled in the study. Seven (0.5%) patients (age 57.4 Â± 9.0 years (45-72); three (43%) men) had pathogenic Î±-galactosidase A mutations. Polymorphisms were identified in 283 patients (20.4%). Maximal left ventricular wall thickness in patients carrying a disease-causing mutation was 18 Â± 2 mm (range 15-22); four patients had concentric LVH and the remainder had asymmetric septal hypertrophy. The prevalence of AFD gene mutations in a large, consecutive cohort of European patients with unexplained LVH is 0.5%.	3
TP53 alterations determine clinical subgroups and survival of patients with choroid plexus tumors. ||  || PURPOSE Choroid plexus carcinomas are pediatric tumors with poor survival rates and a strong, but poorly understood, association with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Currently, with lack of biologic predictors, most children are treated with aggressive chemoradiation protocols. PATIENTS AND METHODS We established a multi-institutional tissue and clinical database, which enabled the analysis of specific alterations of the TP53 tumor suppressor and its modifiers in choroid plexus tumors (CPTs). We conducted high-resolution copy-number analysis to correlate these genetic parameters with family history and outcome. Results We studied 64 patients with CPTs. All individuals with germline TP53 mutations fulfilled LFS criteria, whereas all patients not meeting these criteria harbored wild-type TP53 (P < .001). TP53 mutations were found in 50% of choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs). Additionally, two sequence variants known to confer TP53 dysfunction, TP53 codon72 and MDM2 SNP309, coexisted in the majority of TP53 wild-type CPCs (92%) and not in TP53 mutated CPC (P = .04), which suggests a complementary mechanism of TP53 dysfunction in the absence of a TP53 mutation. High-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis revealed extremely high total structural variation (TSV) in TP53-mutated CPC tumor genomes compared with TP53 wild-type tumors and choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs; P = .006 and .004, respectively). Moreover, high TSV was associated with significant risk of progression (P < .001). Five-year survival rates for patients with TP53-immunopositive and -immunonegative CPCs were 0% and 82 (+/- 9%), respectively (P < .001). Furthermore, 14 of 16 patients with TP53 wild-type CPCs are alive without having received radiation therapy. CONCLUSION Patients with CPC who have low tumor TSV and absence of TP53 dysfunction have a favorable prognosis and can be successfully treated without radiation therapy.	3 4
BAG3 mutations: another cause of giant axonal neuropathy. || Action Potentials Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing Adolescent Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins Child Electromyography Female Giant Axonal Neuropathy Humans Male Mutation || Mutations in Bcl-2 associated athanogene-3 (BAG3) are a rare cause of myofibrillar myopathy, characterised by rapidly progressive proximal and axial myopathy, cardiomyopathy and respiratory compromise. Neuropathy has been documented neurophysiologically in previously reported cases of BAG3-associated myofibrillar myopathy and in some cases giant axons were observed on nerve biopsies; however, neuropathy was not thought to be a dominant feature of the disease. In the context of inherited neuropathy, giant axons are typically associated with autosomal recessive giant axonal neuropathy caused by gigaxonin mutations but have also been reported in association with NEFL- and SH3TC2-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Here, we describe four patients with heterozygous BAG3 mutations with clinical evidence of a sensorimotor neuropathy, with predominantly axonal features on neurophysiology. Three patients presented with a significant neuropathy. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one patient revealed mild to moderate atrophy without prominent selectivity. Examination of sural nerve biopsies in two patients demonstrated giant axons. This report confirms the association of giant axonal neuropathy with BAG3-associated myofibrillar myopathy, and highlights that neuropathy may be a significant feature.	4
Risk-reducing total gastrectomy for germline mutations in E-cadherin (CDH1): pathologic findings with clinical implications. || Adult Aged Antigens, CD Cadherins Carcinoma, Signet Ring Cell Female Gastrectomy Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Risk Factors Stomach Neoplasms || Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is a rare autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by germline E-cadherin (CDH1) mutations in 40% of cases with a high degree of penetrance. Screening endoscopy has not been useful in identifying early cancer, in part owing to conflicting data concerning site(s) of involvement in the stomach and the lack of endoscopically detectable pathology. Risk-reducing total gastrectomy specimens from 8 asymptomatic adults with germline mutations in the CDH1 gene (3 different pedigrees) were studied using a sequential serial sectioning protocol with submission of the entire stomach for histologic analysis. The presence, size, and distribution of signet ring cell clusters were determined for each section and geographic maps of the invasive foci were constructed and compared with gastrectomy specimens from patients with germline E-cadherin mutation and symptomatic gastric cancer. All but 1 of the asymptomatic patients with germline mutations in the CDH1 gene had negative endoscopic screening. All risk-reducing gastrectomy specimens were macroscopically normal. All contained multiple foci (mean, 10.9) of microscopic intramucosal signet ring cell carcinoma confined to the superficial gastric mucosa; no invasion of submucosa was identified. In situ carcinoma was present in 6/8 cases. The majority of signet ring foci were located in the proximal one third of the stomach, most within oxyntic-type mucosa. The number and size of foci were not related to age, but there was a trend toward more severe disease burden in women. Stomachs from the symptomatic group of patients with germline CDH1 mutations exhibited infiltrative foci with higher Ki-67 labeling that extended well beyond the superficial mucosa. In addition, while superficial signet ring cancer exhibited decreased or absent E-cadherin and beta-catenin protein expression in all cases studied, deeply invasive signet ring cancer showed reversion to E-cadherin and beta-catenin protein expression in a subset of mutation carriers. Our study indicates that superficial intramucosal signet ring carcinoma, although widespread, is predominantly located in the proximal one third of the stomach in patients with E-cadherin gene mutations. The observed site predilection suggests a possible role for geographically targeted endoscopic surveillance biopsy in patients who elect to delay surgical intervention.	4

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: low frequency of mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) genes among Spanish patients. || Adolescent Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Female Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Spain Troponin T Ventricular Myosins || Mutations in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) genes are reportedly responsible for up to 40% of familial cases with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Although there are no mutational hotspots, most of the mutations are located in specific exons of the MYH7 and TNNT2 genes. Currently it is not possible to predict the phenotype in carriers of mutations in these genes, although it is widely accepted that mutations in the MYH7 gene predispose to severe HC, whereas TNNT2 mutations are frequently linked to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in spite of minimal hypertrophy. We sequenced exons 8, 9, 13-16, 19, 20, 22-24, and 30 of the MYH7 gene and exons 8, 9, 11, and 14-16 of the TNNT2 gene in 30 HC patients (18-60 years of age) from the region of Asturias (Northern Spain); 25 cases (80%) had a family history of the disease. Genomic DNA was amplified, and fragments were directly sequenced. Each DNA variant found in the patients was also analyzed in 200 healthy controls through single-strand conformation analysis. Four of the probands had nucleotide changes absent in the healthy controls. Two cases had mutations previously described in the MYH7 gene (exon 14, Arg453Cys) or the TNNT2 gene (exon 16, Arg278Cys). Two cases had new mutations (MYH7 exon 22, Met822Val; TNNT2 exon 14, Lys247Arg) not found among the healthy controls. We found MYH7 Met822Val in a woman with a severe form of HC; the mutation was absent in her parents, indicating a de novo mutation. MYH7 R453C was present in a woman with mild HC, mother of a son who died from SCD. TNNT2 R278C was present in a woman with severe HC, but a sister and a daughter were mutation carriers and did not have hypertrophy. A patient with severe HC was carrier of TNNT2 247Arg. Mutations in the MYH7 and TNNT2 genes can be found in patients without a family history of HC. However, compared with other populations MYH7 or TNNT2 mutations were rare among our HC patients. This study illustrates the extreme phenotypic heterogeneity in carriers of MYH7 or TNNT2 mutations.	4
Identification of germ-line E-cadherin mutations in gastric cancer families of European origin. || Adult Age of Onset Aged Aged, 80 and over Cadherins Europe Female Germ-Line Mutation Humans Male Middle Aged Pedigree Stomach Neoplasms || E-cadherin germ-line mutations have recently been described as a molecular basis for early-onset familial gastric cancer in Maori kindred. We screened 18 gastric cancer families of European origin for germ-line mutations to determine the proportion in which E-cadherin mutations occur and the clinical characteristics of the affected families. Truncating mutations were identified in three kindred with familial diffuse gastric cancer. In these families, the age of onset of gastric cancer was variable, the penetrance was incomplete, and one kindred contained individuals with cancers at other sites. Here, we show that a proportion of diffuse gastric cancer families of European origin have germ-line E-cadherin mutations; however, these mutations are absent in intestinal gastric cancer families.	2 4 3
An atypical p.N215S variant of Fabry disease with end-stage renal failure. ||  || Fabry disease is an X-linked metabolic disorder resulting in widespread deposition of Globotriaosylceramide within a variety of human tissues. The classical Fabry phenotype is one of early onset disease, with extensive tissue involvement resulting in acroparaesthesia, gastrointestinal disturbances, angiokeratoma, cornea verticillata renal failure, and cardiovascular disease. We describe two brothers exhibiting the GLA p.N215S mutation, a variant most often conferring a late-onset disease confined to the myocardium. The proband was diagnosed aged 34, following investigation into proteinuria. Despite Enzyme Replacement Therapy, he progressed to end-stage renal failure, and subsequently received a renal transplant. He also developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His sibling however, whose disease was detected aged 32 following screening, exhibits mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and no evidence of renal disease. He remains clinically asymptomatic. This case report details a discordant phenotype in brothers with Fabry disease and p.N215S mutation. Despite the fact that in the majority of patients this mutation is associated with a late onset presentation with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we have clearly demonstrated that patients with GLA p.N215S mutation can present with the classical phenotype. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying modifying factors that influence clinical presentation with a more severe phenotype.	3
E-cadherin germline mutations in familial gastric cancer. || Adolescent Adult Aged Cadherins Child Child, Preschool DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Linkage Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Middle Aged Pedigree Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational Stomach Neoplasms || The identification of genes predisposing to familial cancer is an essential step towards understanding the molecular events underlying tumorigenesis and is critical for the clinical management of affected families. Despite a declining incidence, gastric cancer remains a major cause of cancer death worldwide, and about 10% of cases show familial clustering. The relative contributions of inherited susceptibility and environmental effects to familial gastric cancer are poorly understood because little is known of the genetic events that predispose to gastric cancer. Here we describe the identification of the gene responsible for early-onset, histologically poorly differentiated, high grade, diffuse gastric cancer in a large kindred from New Zealand (Aotearoa). Genetic linkage analysis demonstrated significant linkage to markers flanking the gene for the calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin. Sequencing of the E-cadherin gene revealed a G --> T nucleotide substitution in the donor splice consensus sequence of exon 7, leading to a truncated gene product. Diminished E-cadherin expression is associated with aggressive, poorly differentiated carcinomas. Underexpression of E-cadherin is a prognostic marker of poor clinical outcome in many tumour types, and restored expression of E-cadherin in tumour models can suppress the invasiveness of epithelial tumour cells. The role of E-cadherin in gastric cancer susceptibility was confirmed by identifying inactivating mutations in other gastric cancer families. In one family, a frameshift mutation was identified in exon 15, and in a second family a premature stop codon interrupted exon 13. These results describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a molecular basis for familial gastric cancer, and confirm the important role of E-cadherin mutations in cancer.	2 1 4 0 3
Genotype-phenotype analysis in four families with mutations in beta-myosin heavy chain gene responsible for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. ||  || Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease in which one of the most frequently implicated gene is the gene encoding the beta-myosin heavy chain. To date, more than 40 distinct mutations have been found within this gene. In order to progress on the determination of genotype-phenotype relationship, we have screened the beta-myosin heavy chain gene for mutations in 18 probands from unrelated families. We identified the mutation implicated in the disease in four families. Two of them, the Glu930 codon deletion and the Ile263Thr mutation, are reported here for the first time. The two other mutations are the Arg723Cys mutation, that was previously described in a proband as a de novo mutation, and the Arg719Trp mutation. A poor prognosis was associated with the Glu930codon deletion (mean maximal wall thickness (MWT) = 19.5 mm +/- 5) and the Arg719Trp mutation (mean MWT = 15.3 mm +/- 7), whereas a good prognosis was associated with the Arg723Cys mutation (mean MWT = 20.1 mm +/- 7). The combination of clinical and genetic characteristics of each family member suggests that prognosis is related neither to the degree of left ventricular wall thickness nor to a change in the net electrical charge of the protein. Additional family studies are needed to confirm these findings and to contribute to stratify the prognosis according to the mutation involved.	2 4
Beyond BRAF(V600): clinical mutation panel testing by next-generation sequencing in advanced melanoma. || GTP Phosphohydrolases Genes, p53 High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Melanoma Membrane Proteins Mutation Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit Skin Neoplasms || The management of melanoma has evolved owing to improved understanding of its molecular drivers. To augment the current understanding of the prevalence, patterns, and associations of mutations in this disease, the results of clinical testing of 699 advanced melanoma patients using a pan-cancer next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of hotspot regions in 46 genes were reviewed. Mutations were identified in 43 of the 46 genes on the panel. The most common mutations were BRAFV600 (36%), NRAS (21%), TP53 (16%), BRAFNon-V600 (6%), and KIT (4%). Approximately one-third of melanomas had >1 mutation detected, and the number of mutations per tumor was associated with melanoma subtype. Concurrent TP53 mutations were the most frequent events in tumors with BRAFV600 and NRAS mutations. Melanomas with BRAFNon-V600mutations frequently harbored concurrent NRAS mutations (18%), which were rare in tumors with BRAFV600 mutations (1.6%). The prevalence of BRAFV600 and KIT mutations were significantly associated with melanoma subtypes, and BRAFV600 and TP53 mutations were significantly associated with cutaneous primary tumor location. Multiple potential therapeutic targets were identified in metastatic unknown primary and cutaneous melanomas that lacked BRAFV600 and NRAS mutations. These results enrich our understanding of the patterns and clinical associations of oncogenic mutations in melanoma.	3
Longitudinal evaluation and assessment of cardiovascular disease in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. || Adolescent Adult Biomarkers Cardiovascular Diseases Child Child, Preschool Coronary Angiography Disease Progression Exercise Test Female Homozygote Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Infant Longitudinal Studies Male Risk Assessment Time Factors Ultrasonography Young Adult || Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and is characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia from birth and onset of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) during childhood. The onset and progression of CVD using currently available testing methods in children with hoFH have not been fully characterized. A large cohort of patients with hoFH referred to our subspecialty clinic was studied. Thirty-nine patients (22 aged < or =16 years) underwent extensive cardiovascular, lipid, and genetic evaluation. Sixteen children < or =16 years without known CVD when first evaluated were followed up longitudinally for up to 8 years. CVD was clinically evident in 88% of subjects aged >16 years and 9% of those < or =16 years. Markers of atherosclerosis correlated significantly with age at which lipid-lowering treatment was initiated (abnormal coronary angiogram, abnormal aortic valve using echocardiography, and high calcium score using electron beam computed tomography; all p <0.01; abnormal carotid Doppler result; p = 0.03). Twenty of 22 children had no clinical evidence of coronary artery disease, yet 7 of these children had angiographically confirmed mild coronary artery disease (<50%) and 8 had mild to moderate aortic regurgitation using echocardiography. Of noninvasive tests, only evaluation of aortic valve regurgitation using echocardiography predicted the presence of angiographic coronary stenosis (p <0.001). During follow-up, 7 children developed progression of coronary and/or aortic valvular disease during their teenage years and 4 required surgical interventions. In conclusion, in these patients aggressive lipid-lowering treatment initiated in early childhood is warranted. Careful coronary and valvular surveillance strategies and coronary revascularization when appropriate are also warranted in this high-risk population.	4
Systematic cell-based phenotyping of missense alleles empowers rare variant association studies: a case for LDLR and myocardial infarction. || Alleles Cholesterol, LDL Exome Genetic Association Studies Heterozygote Humans Mutation, Missense Myocardial Infarction Phenotype Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Receptors, LDL Sequence Analysis, DNA || A fundamental challenge to contemporary genetics is to distinguish rare missense alleles that disrupt protein functions from the majority of alleles neutral on protein activities. High-throughput experimental tools to securely discriminate between disruptive and non-disruptive missense alleles are currently missing. Here we establish a scalable cell-based strategy to profile the biological effects and likely disease relevance of rare missense variants in vitro. We apply this strategy to systematically characterize missense alleles in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene identified through exome sequencing of 3,235 individuals and exome-chip profiling of 39,186 individuals. Our strategy reliably identifies disruptive missense alleles, and disruptive-allele carriers have higher plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Importantly, considering experimental data refined the risk of rare LDLR allele carriers from 4.5- to 25.3-fold for high LDL-C, and from 2.1- to 20-fold for early-onset myocardial infarction. Our study generates proof-of-concept that systematic functional variant profiling may empower rare variant-association studies by orders of magnitude.	4 0
Glycogenosis type II (acid maltase deficiency). ||  || Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II/glycogenosis type II/Pompe's disease/acid maltase deficiency) is caused by the deficiency of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase resulting in lysosomal accumulation of glycogen. The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and is clinically heterogeneous. Early and late onset phenotypes are distinguished. Insight in the molecular nature of the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase deficiency and the underlying genetic defect has increased significantly during the past decade. This minireview on GSD II was written at the occasion of The International Symposium on Glycolytic and Mitochondrial Defects in Muscle and Nerve, held in Osaka, Japan, July 1994. It is an update of current literature, but also includes original data from the collaborating authors on mutations occurring in the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene and on prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling. The genotype-phenotype correlation and the prospects for therapy are addressed.	1
Spectrum of HNF1A and GCK mutations in Canadian families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). ||  || Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a subtype of type 2 diabetes characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance and early onset. The pathophysiology of MODY is primarily defective insulin secretion resulting from mutations in at least 6 different genes. Most affected patients harbour mutations in either GCK (encoding glucokinase, also called MODY2) and HNF1A (encoding hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha, also called MODY3). We studied Canadian probands to determine if they had mutations in MODY2 or MODY3 genes. We used genomic DNA sequencing of probands from 9 previously unreported Canadian MODY families. Five MODY probands had mutations in HNF1A, of which 4 were novel (namely IVS5-1delTAG, E275fsdelGAAG, F268S and L44fsdelC) and 4 had mutations in GCK, of which 2 were novel (E237K and L324P). These mutations expand the spectrum of MODY mutations and bring the total number of Canadian MODY families that have been molecularly defined in our laboratory to 15 (8 MODY3 and 7 MODY2). Because of the growing evidence that molecular diagnosis may affect prognosis and treatment, this information may be important in future for Canadian MODY families and their physicians.	2 4
Eight novel LDL receptor gene mutations among patients under LDL apheresis in Dresden and Leipzig. ||  || LDL apheresis is highly efficient in reducing elevated plasma cholesterol. Due to strict indications only patients with severe, refractory hypercholesterolemia are treated with this method. Mutations in the LDL receptor gene are major genetic causes for severe hypercholesterolemia. Screening the entire gene in LDL apheresis patients from Saxony should determine whether an increased frequency of defined mutations is responsible for the atherogenic hypercholesterolemia in this group. 31 unrelated patients (15 male, 16 female, age 33-71 yrs.) were included in the analysis. The LDL-R gene was screened using SSCP and/or automated sequencing. The familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) mutation was genotyped using established PCR techniques. Nineteen of 31 patients were carriers of an LDL-R mutation. Ten missense and two nonsense mutations, three insertions and two deletions were detected. The mutations C74S, C74R, T87M, 660delC, 662insCCCCG, 680insGGACAAATCTGA, 1428insC and 2167delG have not been previously described. One patient was compound heterozygous for two missense mutations. Two further patients were heterozygous for FDB. No mutations were found among controls. A genetic background for hypercholesterolemia in the LDL-R could be established in about 61% of the patients examined. Therefore, methods of DNA analysis allow to recognize and adequately treat a large portion of high-risk individuals at an early stage.	4
Distinct expression profiles for PTEN transcript and its splice variants in Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome. || Base Sequence DNA Primers DNA, Complementary Female Gene Expression Profiling Hamartoma Syndrome, Multiple Humans Male PTEN Phosphohydrolase Polymerase Chain Reaction RNA Splicing RNA, Messenger Syndrome || Cowden syndrome (CS) and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) are autosomal dominant hamartoma syndromes. Germline PTEN mutations have been associated with 85% of CS cases and 65% of BRRS cases and also with other disorders, which are collectively referred to as the "PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome." The human PTEN gene has been previously found to express two naturally occurring splice variants (SVs). Recently, we identified eight novel naturally occurring PTEN SVs that result in different downstream signaling effects: SV3a, SV3b, SV3c (inclusion of various lengths of intron 3 3' of exon 3), SV5a, SV5b, SV5c, SV5d (inclusion of various lengths of intron 5 3' of exon 5), and SV Delta Ex6 (deletion of exon 6). We therefore sought to characterize the relative expression of 5', middle, and 3' full-length PTEN mRNA (FL-PTEN) and also of these eight PTEN SVs in 85 (65 female and 20 male) patients with CS/BRRS (with or without PTEN mutations) compared with 27 controls, using a SYBR green quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Significantly reduced FL-PTEN levels were found in the probands, compared with those of controls (P < .01). Apart from FL-PTEN, SV3a is the most consistently relatively underexpressed in patients compared with controls. The patients showed relative underexpression of SV3a and SV3b and overexpression of SV5b (P = .005, P = .02, and P = .04, respectively). Indeed, there appears to be an SV expressional genotype-phenotype correlation in which the SV expressional profiles are distinct among CS, CS-like, and BRRS. The reduced FL-PTEN transcript expression, associated with differential expression of PTEN SVs, regardless of PTEN mutation status, supports the concept that modulation of PTEN inactivation may also occur at the transcription level influencing the specific phenotypes seen in these syndromes.	3 1 0
Spectrum of mutations in Italian patients with familial hypercholesterolemia: New results from the LIPIGEN study. || Apolipoprotein B-100 Atherosclerosis Cholesterol DNA Mutational Analysis Databases, Factual Genetic Markers Genetic Predisposition to Disease Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Italy Mutation Phenotype Preliminary Data Prognosis Proprotein Convertase 9 Receptors, LDL Risk Factors || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by elevated plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol that confers an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Early identification and treatment of FH patients can improve prognosis and reduce the burden of cardiovascular mortality. Aim of this study was to perform the mutational analysis of FH patients identified through a collaboration of 20 Lipid Clinics in Italy (LIPIGEN Study). We recruited 1592 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of definite or probable FH according to the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria. We performed a parallel sequencing of the major candidate genes for monogenic hypercholesterolemia (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, APOE, LDLRAP1, STAP1). A total of 213 variants were detected in 1076 subjects. About 90% of them had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. More than 94% of patients carried pathogenic variants in LDLR gene, 27 of which were novel. Pathogenic variants in APOB and PCSK9 were exceedingly rare. We found 4 true homozygotes and 5 putative compound heterozygotes for pathogenic variants in LDLR gene, as well as 5 double heterozygotes for LDLR/APOB pathogenic variants. Two patients were homozygous for pathogenic variants in LDLRAP1 gene resulting in autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia. One patient was found to be heterozygous for the ApoE variant p.(Leu167del), known to confer an FH phenotype. This study shows the molecular characteristics of the FH patients identified in Italy over the last two years. Full phenotypic characterization of these patients and cascade screening of family members is now in progress.	4
HRAS mutants identified in Costello syndrome patients can induce cellular senescence: possible implications for the pathogenesis of Costello syndrome. || Adolescent Adult Animals Cell Line Cellular Senescence Child Child, Preschool Codon Costello Syndrome DNA Mutational Analysis Female Fibroblasts Genotype Humans Infant Male Mice Mutation NIH 3T3 Cells Phenotype Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) Signal Transduction Up-Regulation || Costello syndrome (CS) is a congenital disease that is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, failure to thrive, mental retardation and cardiomyopathy. In 2005, we discovered that heterozygous germline mutations in HRAS caused CS. Several studies have shown that CS-associated HRAS mutations are clustered in codons 12 and 13, and mutations in other codons have also been identified. However, a comprehensive comparison of the substitutions identified in patients with CS has not been conducted. In the current study, we identified four mutations (p.G12S, p.G12A, p.G12C and p.G12D) in 21 patients and analyzed the associated clinical manifestations of CS in these individuals. To examine functional differences among the identified mutations, we characterized a total of nine HRAS mutants, including seven distinct substitutions in codons 12 and 13, p.K117R and p.A146T. The p.A146T mutant demonstrated the weakest Raf-binding activity, and the p.K117R and p.A146T mutants had weaker effects on downstream c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling than did codon 12 or 13 mutants. We demonstrated that these mutant HRAS proteins induced senescence when overexpressed in human fibroblasts. Oncogene-induced senescence is a cellular reaction that controls cell proliferation in response to oncogenic mutation and it has been considered one of the tumor suppression mechanisms in vivo. Our findings suggest that the HRAS mutations identified in CS are sufficient to cause oncogene-induced senescence and that cellular senescence might therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of CS.	0
Advancing genetic testing for deafness with genomic technology. || Adolescent Adult Deafness Female Genetic Testing Genomics Humans Male Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Reproducibility of Results Sequence Analysis, DNA || Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is the most common sensory impairment in humans. Until recently its extreme genetic heterogeneity precluded comprehensive genetic testing. Using a platform that couples targeted genomic enrichment (TGE) and massively parallel sequencing (MPS) to sequence all exons of all genes implicated in NSHL, we tested 100 persons with presumed genetic NSHL and in so doing established sequencing requirements for maximum sensitivity and defined MPS quality score metrics that obviate Sanger validation of variants. We examined DNA from 100 sequentially collected probands with presumed genetic NSHL without exclusions due to inheritance, previous genetic testing, or type of hearing loss. We performed TGE using post-capture multiplexing in variable pool sizes followed by Illumina sequencing. We developed a local Galaxy installation on a high performance computing cluster for bioinformatics analysis. To obtain maximum variant sensitivity with this platform 3.2-6.3 million total mapped sequencing reads per sample were required. Quality score analysis showed that Sanger validation was not required for 95% of variants. Our overall diagnostic rate was 42%, but this varied by clinical features from 0% for persons with asymmetric hearing loss to 56% for persons with bilateral autosomal recessive NSHL. These findings will direct the use of TGE and MPS strategies for genetic diagnosis for NSHL. Our diagnostic rate highlights the need for further research on genetic deafness focused on novel gene identification and an improved understanding of the role of non-exonic mutations. The unsolved families we have identified provide a valuable resource to address these areas.	4
Identification of a de novo point mutation resulting in infantile form of Pompe's disease. || Amino Acid Sequence Base Sequence DNA Primers Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant Male Molecular Sequence Data Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Point Mutation Structure-Activity Relationship alpha-Glucosidases || One patient in a nonconsanguineous Taiwanese family with infantile glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe's) disease was found to have a de novo mutation of G1933 to C transition [corrected] in exon 14 of the human lysosomal alpha-D-glucosidase gene. Patient was homozygous and both parents were heterozygous for the mutant allele. The mutation caused an Asp to His substitution at amino acid position 645. The mutation was introduced in wild type lysosomal alpha-D-glucosidase cDNA and the mutant construct was expressed in vivo. The Glu to His substitution was proven to cause significant loss of enzyme activity. In homozygous form it leads to the severe infantile phenotype of Pompe's disease.	3 1 0
Prenatal diagnostic testing of the Noonan syndrome genes in fetuses with abnormal ultrasound findings. || Abortion, Eugenic DNA Mutational Analysis Female Humans Karyotype Molecular Diagnostic Techniques Noonan Syndrome Nuchal Translucency Measurement Pregnancy Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Proto-Oncogene Proteins Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras) ras Proteins || In recent studies on prenatal testing for Noonan syndrome (NS) in fetuses with an increased nuchal translucency (NT) and a normal karyotype, mutations have been reported in 9-16% of cases. In this study, DNA of 75 fetuses with a normal karyotype and abnormal ultrasound findings was tested in a diagnostic setting for mutations in (a subset of) the four most commonly mutated NS genes. A de novo mutation in either PTPN11, KRAS or RAF1 was detected in 13 fetuses (17.3%). Ultrasound findings were increased NT, distended jugular lymphatic sacs (JLS), hydrothorax, renal anomalies, polyhydramnios, cystic hygroma, cardiac anomalies, hydrops fetalis and ascites. A second group, consisting of anonymized DNA of 60 other fetuses with sonographic abnormalities, was tested for mutations in 10 NS genes. In this group, five possible pathogenic mutations have been identified (in PTPN11 (n=2), RAF1, BRAF and MAP2K1 (each n=1)). We recommend prenatal testing of PTPN11, KRAS and RAF1 in pregnancies with an increased NT and at least one of the following additional features: polyhydramnios, hydrops fetalis, renal anomalies, distended JLS, hydrothorax, cardiac anomalies, cystic hygroma and ascites. If possible, mutation analysis of BRAF and MAP2K1 should be considered.	4 0
Next generation sequencing-based emerging trends in molecular biology of gastric cancer. ||  || Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related mortality in the world. Being asymptomatic in nature till advanced stage, diagnosis of gastric cancer becomes difficult in early stages of the disease. The onset and progression of gastric cancer has been attributed to multiple factors including genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, and dietary habits. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based approachesviz. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), RNA-Seq, and targeted sequencing have expanded the knowledge base of molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer. In this review, we highlight recent NGS-based advances covering various genetic alterations (Microsatellite Instability, Single Nucleotide Variations, and Copy Number Variations), epigenetic changes (DNA methylation, histone modification, microRNAs) and differential gene expression during gastric tumorigenesis. We also briefly discuss the current and future potential biomarkers, drugs and therapeutic approaches available for the management of gastric cancer.	4
Genetic identification of familial hypercholesterolemia within a single U.S. health care system. || Coloring Agents Coronary Artery Disease Delivery of Health Care Drug Utilization Electronic Health Records Exome Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Lipoproteins, LDL Prevalence United States || Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) remains underdiagnosed despite widespread cholesterol screening. Exome sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data of 50,726 individuals were used to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of FH-associated genomic variants in the Geisinger Health System. The estimated FH prevalence was 1:256 in unselected participants and 1:118 in participants ascertained via the cardiac catheterization laboratory. FH variant carriers had significantly increased risk of coronary artery disease. Only 24% of carriers met EHR-based presequencing criteria for probable or definite FH diagnosis. Active statin use was identified in 58% of carriers; 46% of statin-treated carriers had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level below 100 mg/dl. Thus, we find that genomic screening can prompt the diagnosis of FH patients, most of whom are receiving inadequate lipid-lowering therapy.	4
Genotype-phenotype correlation and mutation spectrum in a large cohort of patients with inherited retinal dystrophy revealed by next-generation sequencing. || Adult Aged Alleles Exome Female Genetic Association Studies Genotype High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation, Missense Pedigree Retinal Dystrophies Retinitis Pigmentosa || Inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Because of extreme genetic heterogeneity, the etiology and genotypic spectrum of IRD have not been clearly defined, and there is limited information on genotype-phenotype correlations. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mutational spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations of IRD. We developed a targeted panel of 164 known retinal disease genes, 88 candidate genes, and 32 retina-abundant microRNAs, used for exome sequencing. A total of 179 Chinese families with IRD were recruited. In 99 unrelated patients, a total of 124 mutations in known retinal disease genes were identified, including 79 novel mutations (detection rate, 55.3%). Moreover, novel genotype-phenotype correlations were discovered, and phenotypic trends noted. Three cases are reported, including the identification of AHI1 as a novel candidate gene for nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa. This study revealed novel genotype-phenotype correlations, including a novel candidate gene, and identified 124 genetic defects within a cohort with IRD . The identification of novel genotype-phenotype correlations and the spectrum of mutations greatly enhance the current knowledge of IRD phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity, which will assist both clinical diagnoses and personalized treatments of IRD patients.	1
Genotype phenotype correlations of cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain mutations in Indian patients with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. || Adult Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic DNA Mutational Analysis Echocardiography Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Genetic Variation Genotype Humans India Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Pedigree Phenotype Ventricular Myosins Young Adult || The aim of the current study was to determine the frequency of mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) in a cohort of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and their families, and to investigate correlations between genotype and phenotype. About 130 consecutive patients diagnosed with HCM or DCM (69 with HCM and 61 with DCM) attending the cardiology clinic of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research were screened for mutations in the MYH7 gene. The control group for genetic studies consisted of 100 healthy subjects. We report 14 mutations in 6 probands (5 probands in HCM and 1 proband in DCM) and their family members. Out of these 6 mutations, 3 are new and are being reported for the first time. One known mutation (p.Gly716Arg) was found to be "de novo" which resulted in severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy (31 mm) and resulted in the sudden cardiac death (SCD) of the proband at the age of 21 years. Further, a DCM causing novel mutation p.Gly377Ser was identified which resulted in the milder phenotype. The present study shows that there is genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of cardiomyopathies in Indian population. Further, the location and type of mutation in a given sarcomeric gene determines the severity and phenotypic plasticity in cardiomyopathies.	4
c.1437G>A intron 9 substitution on acid Î±-glucosidase gene associated with classic infantile-onset Pompe disease phenotype. || Alleles Family Genetic Carrier Screening Genotype Glycogen Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant Introns Lysosomes Male Muscle Hypotonia Phenotype Point Mutation Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease, or glycogen storage disease type II (GSD2), an autosomal recessive disease first described by Joannes Cassianus Pompe (1901-1945), causes deficient activity of acid Î±-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme. GAA catalyses Î± 1,4 and Î± 1,6 glucosidic linkages in lysosomes; destruction of these linkages permits glycogen to be separated into glucose and later used for energy. Without proper function of this enzyme, glycogen accumulates in lysosome, causing muscle hypotonia. We report a previously undescribed association of c.1437G>A intron 9 substitution on the GAA gene with severe infantile-onset Pompe disease in a deceased proband and carrier status in four of five surviving family members. Previous authors have found late-onset or moderate severity infantile-onset Pompe disease associated with this allelic variation. Our proband's family's village was suspicious for locally endemic disease. While our proband developed all features of classic infantile onset GSD2, socioeconomic and geographic factors initially suggested an infectious aetiology.	1
Immune Tolerance Strategies in Siblings with Infantile Pompe Disease-Advantages for a Preemptive Approach to High-Sustained Antibody Titers. ||  || Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has led to a significant improvement in the clinical course of patients with infantile Pompe disease (IPD), an autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder characterized by the deficiency in lysosomal acid Î±-glucosidase. A subset of IPD patients mount a substantial immune response to ERT developing high sustained anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers (HSAT) leading to the ineffectiveness of this treatment. HSAT have been challenging to treat, although preemptive approaches have shown success in high-risk patients (those who are cross-reactive immunological material [CRIM]-negative). More recently, the addition of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor known to target plasma cells, to immunotherapy with rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin has shown success at significantly reducing the anti-rhGAA antibody titers in three patients with HSAT. In this report, we present the successful use of a bortezomib-based approach in a CRIM-positive IPD patient with HSAT and the use of a preemptive approach to prevent immunologic response in an affected younger sibling. We highlight the significant difference in clinical course between the two patients, particularly that a pre-emptive approach was simple and effective in preventing the development of high antibody titers in the younger sibling, thus supporting the role of immune tolerance induction (ITI) in the ERT-naÃ¯ve high-risk setting.	1

Novel mutations in African American patients with glycogen storage disease Type II. Mutations in brief no. 209. Online. ||  || The infantile form of GSD II (an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, acid alpha-glucosidase, Pompe disease) is a severe and invariably fatal disease characterized by a rapidly progressive generalized hypotonia, hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly. We have recently demonstrated that African American patients share a common nonsense R854X mutation in exon 18 (Becker et al., 1998). Two other mutations, D645E and M519V, have been identified in individual African American patients (Hermans et al., 1993a; Huie et al., 1994a). We describe here three novel mutations in this population group: a missense W481R in exon 10, a deletion of a T1441 in exon 10, and a splicing defect at the 5' donor site of intron 8 (IVS g+la) . The splicing defect is shared by two unrelated patients and it is linked to intragenic polymorphic sites identical to those found in patients bearing the common R854X mutation.	1 4
Diagnostic efficacy of the fluorometric determination of enzyme activity for Pompe disease from dried blood specimens compared with lymphocytes-possibility for newborn screening. ||  || Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal-recessive disorder which results from a defect in the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). The onset of this disease is highly variable, with infantile types being the most severe. Traditionally, lymphocytes, fibroblasts or muscle biopsies were necessary for enzyme activity measurement, because these materials do not express maltase-glucoamylase (MGA) that interferes with the assay. Recently, acarbose was found to inhibit MGA activity selectively, so that dried blood became accessible for GAA assessment. To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of GAA measurement in dried blood specimens (DBSs) in comparison with lymphocytes. If DBSs provided reliable results, the diagnosis of Pompe disease could be facilitated, and high-throughput screening would become possible. GAA activity was measured in DBSs of known patients at pH 3.8 (with and without acarbose) and at pH 7.0. Additionally, lymphocytes were obtained from the same patients, and the enzyme activity was determined at pH 4 to pH 7. In total, seven infantile patients and 29 patients with late-onset variants were investigated. All patients were reliably identified by both methods. Furthermore, a simplified protocol was established for neonatal screening. The fluorometric technique for the assessment of GAA activity in DBS provides a reliable diagnosis for all variants of Pompe disease. The assay protocol could be simplified for neonatal screening, without increasing the false positive rate significantly or burdening the laboratory with time-consuming procedures.	1

Enzyme therapy and immune response in relation to CRIM status: the Dutch experience in classic infantile Pompe disease. ||  || Enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) in Pompe disease--an inherited metabolic disorder caused by acid Î±-glucosidase deficiency and characterized in infants by generalized muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy--can be complicated by immune responses. Infants that do not produce any endogenous acid Î±-glucosidase, so-called CRIM-negative patients, reportedly develop a strong response. We report the clinical outcome of our Dutch infants in relation to their CRIM status and immune response. Eleven patients were genotyped and their CRIM status was determined. Antibody formation and clinical outcome were assessed for a minimum of 4 years. ERT was commenced between 0.1 and 8.3 months of age, and patients were treated from 0.3 to 13.7 years. All patients developed antibodies. Those with a high antibody titer (above 1:31,250) had a poor response. The antibody titers varied substantially between patients and did not strictly correlate with the patients' CRIM status. Patients who started ERT beyond 2 months of age tended to develop higher titers than those who started earlier. All three CRIM-negative patients in our study succumbed by the age of 4 years seemingly unrelated to the height of their antibody titer. Antibody formation is a common response to ERT in classic infantile Pompe disease and counteracts the effect of treatment. The counteracting effect seems determined by the antibody:enzyme molecular stoichiometry. The immune response may be minimized by early start of ERT and by immune modulation, as proposed by colleagues. The CRIM-negative status itself seems associated with poor outcome.	3 1 0
Novel PKU mutation on haplotype 2 in French-Canadians. ||  || We analyzed DNA from nine French-Canadian probands from eastern Quebec province; all had hyperphenylalaninemia (phenylketonuria [PKU] or non-PKU forms) caused by mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus. Analysis of RFLP haplotypes and mutations revealed a novel mutation, an A-to-G transition (met----val) in codon 1 (the translation-initiation codon). It occurred on 5 of the 18 mutant chromosomes and was associated each time with haplotype 2. A proband homozygous for this mutation had the PKU phenotype. In other probands, the codon 1 mutation was inherited once with the splice junction mutation in exon 12 (on haplotype 3), conferring PKU, and was inherited twice with a mutation on haplotype 1, conferring PKU in one proband and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia in the other. The other five probands carried mutations, conferring PKU, on the following haplotype combinations: 1/3 (twice), 1/9, 3/4, and 1/1. The mutations on haplotypes 1, 4, and 9 are not yet characterized. This preliminary study reveals a novel PKU mutation and considerable genetic heterogeneity at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in French-Canadians.	3
First molecular screening of deafness in the Altai Republic population. || Adolescent Adult Aged Child Child, Preschool Connexin 26 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Female Genetic Testing Humans Male Middle Aged Mitochondria Siberia || We studied the molecular basis of NSHL in Republic of Altai (South Siberia, Russia). The Altaians are the indigenous Asian population of the Altai Mountain region considered as a melting-pot and a dispersion center for world-wide human expansions in the past. A total of 76 patients of Altaian, Russian or mixed ethnicity and 130 Altaian controls were analyzed by PCR-DHPLC and sequencing in the GJB2 gene. The GJB6 deletion and the common non-syndromic deafness-causing mitochondrial mutations were also tested when appropriate. 8.3% of the Altaian chromosomes were carrying GJB2 mutations versus 46.9% of the Russian chromosomes. The 235delC mutation was predominant among Altaians, whereas the 35delG mutation was most prevalent among Russian patients. We found an Asian-specific GJB2 diversity among Altaians, and different GJB2 contribution for deafness in the Altaian and Russian patients. The high carrier frequency of 235delC in Altaians (4.6%) is probably defined by gene drift/founder effect in a particular group. The question whether the Altai region could be one of founder sources for the 235delC mutation widespread in Asia is open.	4
[Application of enzyme assay and gene analysis in the prenatal diagnosis for a family with glycogen storage disease type II]. ||  || To carry out prenatal diagnosis for a glycogen storage disease type II (GSD II ) affected family. The acid-Î± -glucosidase (GAA) activity was measured in whole leukocytes and cultured amniocytes with 4-methylumbelliferyl-Î± -D-glucopyranoside as substrate and with acarbose as inhibitor. The coding regions of GAA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. The proband and the fetus had low GAA activity (12.3% and 1.1% of the average normal range, respectively). Mutation analysis of the GAA gene revealed a novel nonsense mutation p.W738X and a reported nonsense mutation p.E888X in both the proband and the fetus; the reported pseudodeficiency allele c.[1726G to A: 2065G to A] was found in the proband, the mother and the fetus. The proband and the fetus were both GSD II affected. A combination of GAA activity analysis and mutation analysis is efficient for the prenatal diagnosis of GSD II. Mutation analysis should be a routine method in the prenatal diagnosis of GSD II in Asian population, where pseudodeficiency allele can cause low GAA activity in normal individuals which is relatively common in Asian.	1
Missense mutations prevalent in Orientals with phenylketonuria: molecular characterization and clinical implications. || Alleles Animals Asian Continental Ancestry Group Base Sequence Child, Preschool DNA European Continental Ancestry Group Exons Female Genetic Testing Genotype Humans Infant Male Mice Molecular Sequence Data Mutagenesis, Site-Directed Mutation Oligonucleotide Probes Pedigree Phenotype Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Prenatal Diagnosis || Two missense mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genes of Orientals with phenylketonuria (PKU) have been identified. A G-to-A transition in exon 7 of the gene results in the substitution of Gln243 for Arg243 (R243Q) and accounts for 18% of all PKU chromosomes among Chinese. An A-to-G transition in exon 6 of the gene results in the substitution of Cys204 for Tyr204 (Y204C) and identifies about 13 and 5% of all PKU chromosomes in the Chinese and Japanese populations, respectively. The R243Q construct produced less than 10% of normal PAH activity in in vitro expression analysis in a eukaryotic cell system, and patients homozygous for this substitution exhibit a severe clinical phenotype. These results are consistent with previous findings in this expression system. The Y204C construct, however, produced near normal levels of PAH enzyme activity and immunoreactivity in this in vitro expression system. Because this substitution is present only on PKU chromosomes, it is a valuable marker for identifying the corresponding mutant allele for carrier screening of PKU. With the characterization of these two substitutions, about 60% of PKU alleles in China can now be identified. The continuing search for additional PKU mutations will permit effective carrier screening and prenatal gene diagnosis of PKU in East Asia.	3
Pompe disease: literature review and case series. || Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Child Child, Preschool Female Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant, Newborn Male Mutation || Pompe disease is a rare multi-systemic metabolic myopathy caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the acidic alpha glucosidase (GAA) gene. Significant progress had been made in the diagnosis and management of patients with Pompe disease. Here, we describe our experience with 12 patients with various forms of Pompe disease including 4 potentially pathogenic, novel GAA variants. We also review the recent the recent advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of individuals with Pompe disease.	1
Identification of recurrent and novel mutations in the LDL receptor gene in Japanese familial hypercholesterolemia. Mutation in brief no. 248. Online. ||  || We used the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method to investigate 120 Japanese patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) for mutations in the promoter region and the 18 exons and their flanking intron sequence of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. Fourteen aberrant DGGE patterns were found, and the underlying mutations were characterized by DNA sequencing. Five novel missense mutations (C317S, F382L A410T, L547V, and E693K), two nonsense mutations (W512X and K790X), four frameshift mutation (355del7, 1246ins5, 1687ins1, and 2035ins1), one splicing mutation (1845+2 T-->C), and two inframe mutations (661ins21 and 1115del9/ins6) were identified. Six of these mutations (L547V, E693K, W512X, 355del7, 1687ins1, and 20354ins1) have not been described before in FH. These newly identified mutations cosegregated in their family members with defective LDL receptor activity and hypercholesterolemia, and are thought to be causal for the FH phenotype. These results demonstrate that there is a broad spectrum of mutations in the LDL receptor gene in the Japanese population.	4
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: two homozygous cases with "typical" hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and three new mutations in cases with progression to dilated cardiomyopathy. || Adult Aged Amino Acid Sequence Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic, Familial Carrier Proteins DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Homozygote Humans Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Muscle Proteins Mutation Sequence Alignment Sequence Analysis, Protein Troponin T Ventricular Myosins || About 10% of cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with unknown causes. We studied 11 unrelated patients (pts) with HCM who progressed to DCM (group A) and 11 who showed "typical" HCM (group B). Mutational analysis of the beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) genes demonstrated eight mutations affecting MYH7 or MYBPC3 gene, five of which were new mutations. In group A-pts, the first new mutation occurred in the myosin head-rod junction and the second occurred in the light chain-binding site. The third new mutation leads to a MYBPC3 lacking titin and myosin binding sites. In group B, two pts with severe HCM carried two homozygous MYBPC3 mutations and one with moderate hypertrophy was a compound heterozygous for MYBPC3 gene. We identified five unreported mutations, potentially "malignant" defects as for the associated phenotypes, but no specific mutations of HCM/DCM.	4
The emerging phenotype of long-term survivors with infantile Pompe disease. || Autoantibodies Bone Diseases, Metabolic Child Child, Preschool Deglutition Deglutition Disorders Enzyme Replacement Therapy Female Gastroesophageal Reflux Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Hearing Loss Humans Male Muscle Weakness Phenotype Retrospective Studies Speech Disorders Survivors Treatment Outcome alpha-Glucosidases || Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa for infantile Pompe disease has improved survival creating new management challenges. We describe an emerging phenotype in a retrospective review of long-term survivors. Inclusion criteria included ventilator-free status and age â¤6 months at treatment initiation, and survival to age â¥5 years. Clinical outcome measures included invasive ventilator-free survival and parameters for cardiac, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, gross motor, and ambulatory status; growth; speech, hearing, and swallowing; and gastrointestinal and nutritional status. Eleven of 17 patients met study criteria. All were cross-reactive immunologic material-positive, alive, and invasive ventilator-free at most recent assessment, with a median age of 8.0 years (range: 5.4-12.0 years). All had marked improvements in cardiac parameters. Commonly present were gross motor weakness, motor speech deficits, sensorineural and/or conductive hearing loss, osteopenia, gastroesophageal reflux, and dysphagia with aspiration risk. Seven of 11 patients were independently ambulatory and four required the use of assistive ambulatory devices. All long-term survivors had low or undetectable anti-alglucosidase alfa antibody titers. Long-term survivors exhibited sustained improvements in cardiac parameters and gross motor function. Residual muscle weakness, hearing loss, risk for arrhythmias, hypernasal speech, dysphagia with risk for aspiration, and osteopenia were commonly observed findings.	3 1 4
Analysis of the thyroid phenotype in 42 patients with Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct. || Adolescent Adult Alleles Child Child, Preschool Female Genetic Association Studies Goiter Goiter, Nodular Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Hypothyroidism Male Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Phenotype Sulfate Transporters Thyroid Gland Vestibular Aqueduct Young Adult || Pendred syndrome (PS), a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 (PDS) gene, is associated with deafness and goiter. SLC26A4 mutations have also been identified in patients exhibiting isolated sensorineural hearing loss without apparent thyroid abnormality (nonsyndromic enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct; nonsyndromic EVA). Our aim was to describe systematically the thyroidal phenotypes and the SLC26A4 genotypes of patients presenting with PS or nonsyndromic EVA. Nineteen patients with PS and 23 patients with nonsyndromic EVA, aged 5-53 years, were included. They underwent thyroid evaluation (physical examination, biological thyroid function tests, measurement of thyroglobulin level, thyroid ultrasonography, and thyroid (123)I scintigraphy with perchlorate discharge test), otological evaluation, and SLC26A4 mutation screening. In 19 patients with PS, goiter was identified in 15 (79%) and hypothyroidism in 15 (79%); hypothyroidism was subclinical in four patients and congenital in six patients. The perchlorate discharge test (PDT) was positive in 10/16 (63%). Morphological evaluation of the inner ear using MRI and/or CT showed bilateral EVA in 15/15 PS patients. Mutation screening revealed two SLC26A4 mutant alleles in all 19 PS patients that were homozygous in two families and compound heterozygous in 12 families. In the 23 patients with nonsyndromic EVA, systematic thyroid evaluation found no abnormalities except for slightly increased thyroglobulin levels in two patients. SLC26A4 mutations were identified in 9/23 (39%). Mutations were biallelic in two (compound heterozygous) and monoallelic in seven patients. The thyroid phenotype is widely variable in PS. SLC26A4 mutation screening is needed in patients exhibiting PS or nonsyndromic EVA. PS is associated with biallelic SLC26A4 mutations and nonsyndromic EVA with no, monoallelic, or biallelic SLC26A4 mutations. Systematic thyroid evaluation is recommended in patients with nonsyndromic EVA associated with one or two SLC26A4 mutations. We propose using a combination of three parameters to define and diagnose PS: (i) sensorineural deafness with bilateral EVA; (ii) thyroid abnormality comprising goiter and/or hypothyroidism and/or a positive PDT; (iii) biallelic SLC26A4 mutations.	1
Incidence and clinical characteristics of thyroid cancer in prospective series of individuals with Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome characterized by germline PTEN, SDH, or KLLN alterations. ||  || Thyroid cancer is believed to be an important component of Cowden syndrome (CS). Germline PTEN and SDHx mutations and KLLN epimutation cause CS and CS-like phenotypes. Despite the established association, little is known about the incidence and clinical features of thyroid cancer found in CS/CS-like patients. The aim of the study was to compare incidence, clinical, and histological characteristics of epithelial thyroid cancers in CS/CS-like individuals, in the context of PTEN, SDHx, and KLLN status. The study encompassed a 5-yr, multicenter, prospective accrual of 2723 CS and CS-like patients, all of whom had comprehensive PTEN analysis. SDHx mutation analysis occurred in those without PTEN mutations/variations and elevated manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) levels. KLLN epimutation analysis was performed in the subset without any PTEN or SDHx mutation/deletion/ variant/polymorphism. Gene-specific thyroid cancer histologies, demographic and clinical information, and adjusted standardized incidence rates were studied. Of 2723 CS/CS-like patients, 664 had thyroid cancer. Standardized incidence rates for thyroid cancer were 72 [95% confidence interval (CI), 51-99; P < 0.001] for pathogenic PTEN mutations, 63 (95% CI, 42-92; P < 0.001) for SDHx variants, and 45 (95% CI, 26-73; P < 0.001) for KLLN epimutations. All six (16.7%) diagnosed under age 18 yr carried pathogenic PTEN mutations. Follicular thyroid cancer was overrepresented in PTEN mutation-positive cases compared to those with SDHx and KLLN alterations. PTEN frameshift mutations were found in 31% of patients with thyroid cancer compared to 17% in those without thyroid cancer. CS/CS-like patients have elevated risks of follicular thyroid cancer due to PTEN pathogenic mutations and of papillary thyroid cancer from SDHx and KLLN alterations. Children presenting with thyroid cancer should be tested for PTEN mutations.	3 4
A model to infer the pathogenic significance of CDH1 germline missense variants. || Alleles Antigens, CD Cadherins Case-Control Studies Computer Simulation Exons Gene Frequency Genetic Variation Germ-Line Mutation Heterozygote Humans Models, Genetic Models, Molecular Multivariate Analysis Mutation, Missense Pedigree Retrospective Studies Stomach Neoplasms || Germline mutations of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) are involved in the tumorigenesis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Recent studies have highlighted the lifesaving potential of total prophylactic gastrectomy for CDH1 germline mutation carriers. In this regard, CDH1 germline mutations of the missense type represent a clinical burden in genetic counseling, as their pathogenic relevance is not straightforward. In this work, we have outlined a possible multivariate approach to infer the significance of such variants. We reviewed all HDGC-associated E-cadherin germline missense mutations reported to date. The information collected included: co-segregation of the mutation within pedigrees, frequency in healthy population control, recurrence in independent families, and functional in vitro and in silico data. We used the neighbor-joining method to group mutations according to the collected information and assessed the robustness of mutation clusters with a bootstrap test. CDH1 germline missense variants were classified according to the parameters defined in the multivariate analysis. This analysis allowed the distribution of the variants into two distinct groups: neutral variants vs mutations. The model described in this study provides an important tool that can ultimately improve the genetic counseling offered to the carriers of the germline CDH1 missense variants.	0
Hair roots as an mRNA source for mutation analysis of Usher syndrome-causing genes. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Hair Heterozygote Humans Mutation RNA, Messenger Usher Syndromes || mRNA is an important tool to study the effects of particular mutations on the mode of splicing and transcripts. However, it is often difficult to isolate mRNA because the organ or tissue in which the gene is expressed cannot be sampled. We previously identified two probable splicing mutations (c.6485+5G>A and c.8559-2A>G) during the mutation analysis of USH2A in Japanese Usher syndrome (USH) type 2 patients, but we could not observe their effects on splicing because the gene is expressed in only a few tissues/organs, and is not expressed in peripheral lymphocytes. In this study, we used hair roots as a source of mRNA of USH-causing genes, and successfully detected the expression of seven, except USH1C and CLRN1, of the nine USH-causing genes. We used RNA extracted from the hair roots of a patient who has both c.6485+5G>A and c.8559-2A>G mutations in USH2A in a compound heterozygous state to observe the effects of these mutations on transcripts. Reverse-transcription PCR analysis revealed that c.6485+5G>A and c.8559-2A>G inactivated splice donor and splice acceptor sites, respectively, and caused skipping of exons. Thus, RNA extracted from hair roots is a potential powerful and convenient tool for the mutation analysis of USH-causing genes.	0
Discovery of pathogenic variants in a large Korean cohort of inherited muscular disorders. || Adult Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Heterogeneity High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Muscular Diseases Mutation Pedigree Republic of Korea || Inherited muscular disorders (IMDs) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous genetic disorders. We investigated the mutational spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations in Korean patients with IMD. We developed a targeted panel of 69 known IMD genes and recruited a total of 209 Korean patients with IMD. Targeted capture sequencing identified 994 different variants. Among them, 98 variants were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants; 38 were novel variations. A total of 39 patients had the pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. Among them, 75 (36%) patients were genetically confirmed, and 18 (9%) patients had one heterozygous variant of recessive myopathy. However, two genetically confirmed patients had an additional heterozygous variant of another recessive myopathy. Four patients with one heterozygous variant of a recessive myopathy showed different phenotypes, compared with the known phenotype of the identified gene. The major causative genes of Korean patients with IMDs were DMD (19 patients), COL6A1 (9), DYSF (9), GNE (7), LMNA (7), CAPN3 (6), and RYR1 (5). This study showed the mutational and clinical spectra in Korean patients with IMD and confirmed the usefulness of strategies utilizing targeted sequencing.	1
Nutraceutical pill containing berberine versus ezetimibe on plasma lipid pattern in hypercholesterolemic subjects and its additive effect in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia on stable cholesterol-lowering treatment. || Aged Anticholesteremic Agents Azetidines Berberine Biological Products Cholesterol, LDL Dietary Supplements Drug Combinations Drug Therapy, Combination Ezetimibe Fatty Alcohols Female Humans Hypercholesterolemia Lipids Male Middle Aged Mutation Receptors, LDL Statistics, Nonparametric Triglycerides || Although statins (STs) are drugs of first choice in hypercholesterolemic patients, especially in those at high cardiovascular risk, some of them are intolerant to STs or refuse treatment with these drugs. In view of this, we have evaluated the lipid-lowering effect of a nutraceutical pill containing berberine (BBR) and of ezetimibe, as alternative treatments, in monotherapy or in combination, in 228 subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia (HCH), with history of STs intolerance or refusing STs treatment. In addition, since PCSK9 was found up-regulated by STs dampening their effect through an LDL receptors (LDLRs) degradation, and BBR suppressed PCSK9 expression in cellular studies, we supplemented the stable lipid-lowering therapy of 30 genotype-confirmed Familial Hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes (HeFH) with BBR, searching for a further plasma cholesterol reduction. Plasma lipid pattern was evaluated at baseline and during treatments. In HCH subjects the nutraceutical pill resulted more effective than EZE in lowering LDL cholesterol (-31.7% vs -25.4%, P < 0.001) and better tolerated. On treatment, LDL-C level below 3.36 mmol/L (â¤130 mg/dl) was observed in 28.9% of subjects treated with the nutraceutical pill and 11.8% of those treated with EZE (P <0.007). In the group treated with EZE the subjects carrying the G allele of the g.1679 C > G silent polymorphism of NPC1L1 gene showed a higher response to EZE than homozygous for the common allele (GG + CG: LDL-C -29.4Â±5.0%, CC -23.6Â±6.5%, P <0.001). Combined treatment with these drugs was as effective as STs in moderate doses (LDL cholesterol -37%, triglycerides -23%). In HeFH patients the addition of BBR resulted in LDL cholesterol reductions inversely related to those induced by the stable therapy (r = -0.617, P <0.0001), with mean 10.5% further decrease. The alternative treatments tested in our HCH subjects were rather effective and safe. The findings in HeFH patients suggest that BBR might act in vivo increasing expression and stability of LDLRs and/or suppressing PCSK9 expression.	4
The correlation of genotype and phenotype in Portuguese hyperphenylalaninemic patients. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Female Genotype Humans Infant Intelligence Intelligence Tests Male Mutation Phenotype Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Portugal Statistics as Topic || To understand the basis for the clinical heterogeneity of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency among Portuguese hyperphenylalaninemic patients, genotype-phenotype correlations were established. A group of 61 patients was completely genotyped, leading to the identification of 20 different mutant alleles in 36 different genotypic combinations, including a mutant allele not reported previously. The severity of those mutations found within this hyperphenylalaninemic population, which have not been previously expressed in vitro, were assessed. The results obtained by the present study exhibit a strong correlation between the predicted residual enzyme activity, as deduced from the genotype of the patients, and the biochemical phenotype represented by the diagnostic parameters (phenylalanine levels before the beginning of treatment and the dietary phenylalanine tolerance). It was observed that only a judicious follow-up and compliance with the appropriate diet permits the correct assessment of the clinical phenotype of the patients. Additionally, based upon the correlation observed between genotypes and diagnostic parameters, it was possible to predict the potential residual enzyme activity of those mutations (identified in our patients) which have not yet been studied in vitro.	3 1
Cooperation of MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) with PTPN11 activating mutation induced monocytic leukemia with a shorter latency in a mouse bone marrow transplantation model. || Animals Bone Marrow Cell Differentiation Cell Transformation, Neoplastic Coculture Techniques Cytarabine Daunorubicin Disease Progression Drug Resistance, Neoplasm Enzyme Activation Female Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Humans Infant Interleukin-3 Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor Macrophages Mice Mice, Inbred C57BL Mutation, Missense Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein Oncogene Proteins, Fusion Point Mutation Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Radiation Chimera Transduction, Genetic Tumor Cells, Cultured || PTPN11 mutation, a RAS signaling pathway mutation, is associated with MLL translocations in acute leukemia. A girl with MLL/AF10 AML was found to carry PTPN11G503A . To study the impact of PTPN11G503A cooperating with MLL/AF10 on leukemogenesis, we established a retroviral transduction/transplantation mouse model. Compared to the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) leukemia cells harboring PTPN11wt , the cells harboring PTPN11G503A were hypersensitive to GM-CSF and IL3, and more resistant to death upon treatment with daunorubicin but sensitive to cytarabine. The cells harboring PTPN11G503A autonomously differentiated into macrophages (1.8%) in the medium containing IL3. Further studies showed that the cells had an elevated (â¼2.9-fold) Csf1 transcription level and secreted more (â¼4.5-fold) M-CSF to the medium which can stimulate monocyte/macrophage differentiation of BM cells. Mice transplanted with the cells harboring PTPN11G503A had a higher concentration of M-CSF in plasma. When mixed with the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) leukemia cells harboring PTPN11wt , the cells harboring PTPN11G503A had an increased competitive engraftment and clonal expansion in the BM and spleen of recipient mice, although no competitive growth advantage was observed in the in vitro co-culturing assays. The mice transplanted with the MLL/AF10(OM-LZ) cells harboring PTPN11wt developed myelomonocytic leukemia, while those transplanted with the cells harboring PTPN11G503A -induced monocytic leukemia in a shorter latency. Our results demonstrated that addition of PTPN11G503A to MLL/AF10 affected cell proliferation, chemo-resistance, differentiation, in vivo BM recruitment/clonal expansion and accelerated disease progression.	0
Prevalence of GJB2 mutations in the Silk Road region of China and a report of three novel variants. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool China Connexin 26 Connexins DNA DNA Mutational Analysis Female Gene Frequency Hearing Loss, Sensorineural Humans Infant Male Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Prevalence Young Adult || The c.235delC of GJB2 gene is the hotspot mutation of the hearing loss population in the Silk Road region of China. It is high time that some active interventions (such as hearing aids or cochlear implant) are provided to improve their language ability and quality of life. The first gene to be identified for humans with nonsyndromic hearing loss was GJB2 gene. We investigated the prevalence of GJB2 mutations in the Silk Road region of China to study the mutation spectrum in this area. Bidirectional sequencing was carried out for all PCR products of samples. The statistical analysis was carried out using SAS 9.0.1 software. Pathogenic mutations were identified in 243 of 2398 patients, including 168 homozygous mutations and 75 compound heterozygous mutations. Three variants (c.225G>T, c.521G>A, and c.557C>T) are novel mutations.	4
Fabry disease: incidence of the common later-onset Î±-galactosidase A IVS4+919GâA mutation in Taiwanese newborns--superiority of DNA-based to enzyme-based newborn screening for common mutations. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group DNA Mutational Analysis Fabry Disease Female Genetic Testing Humans Incidence Infant, Newborn Male Mutation Neonatal Screening RNA Splicing Taiwan alpha-Galactosidase || Fabry disease is a panethnic, X-linked, inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism resulting from mutations in the Î±-galactosidase A gene (GLA) that lead to the deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, Î±-galactosidase A (Î±-Gal A). Affected males with no Î±-Gal A activity have the early-onset classic phenotype, whereas those with residual activity present with the later-onset subtype. Recently, we reported that newborn enzyme-based screening using dried blood spots (DBS) in Taiwan revealed a high incidence of newborn males who had the GLA c.936+919GâA (IVS4+919GâA) mutation. This lesion causes cryptic splicing, markedly reducing the amount of wild-type GLA mRNA, and has been found in males with the later-onset Fabry phenotype, manifesting as cardiac, renal and/or cerebrovascular disease. To more accurately determine the incidence of the IVS4+919GâA mutation, 20,063 consecutive newborns were screened by a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based assay. Of the 10,499 males, 12 (1/875) and 24 of the 9,564 females (1/399) had the mutation. On the basis of these frequencies, the previous newborn enzyme-based DBS screening (cutoff: <30% of the normal mean) only identified 67% and 17% of mutation-positive males and females, respectively. The mean DBS Î±-Gal A activities in the mutation-positive males and females were 23% (1.54 U) and 55% (3.63 U) of normal mean male/female values, respectively. These studies confirm the high incidence of the IVS4+919GâA mutation in the Taiwanese population and indicate that its detectability by enzyme-based DBS screening is unreliable, especially in females. These studies emphasize the superiority of DNA-based newborn screening for common mutations, particularly for X-linked diseases.	3
An informatics approach to analyzing the incidentalome. || Algorithms Alleles Databases, Genetic Gene Frequency Genome-Wide Association Study Genomics Humans Mutation || Next-generation sequencing has transformed genetic research and is poised to revolutionize clinical diagnosis. However, the vast amount of data and inevitable discovery of incidental findings require novel analytic approaches. We therefore implemented for the first time a strategy that utilizes an a priori structured framework and a conservative threshold for selecting clinically relevant incidental findings. We categorized 2,016 genes linked with Mendelian diseases into "bins" based on clinical utility and validity, and used a computational algorithm to analyze 80 whole-genome sequences in order to explore the use of such an approach in a simulated real-world setting. The algorithm effectively reduced the number of variants requiring human review and identified incidental variants with likely clinical relevance. Incorporation of the Human Gene Mutation Database improved the yield for missense mutations but also revealed that a substantial proportion of purported disease-causing mutations were misleading. This approach is adaptable to any clinically relevant bin structure, scalable to the demands of a clinical laboratory workflow, and flexible with respect to advances in genomics. We anticipate that application of this strategy will facilitate pretest informed consent, laboratory analysis, and posttest return of results in a clinical context.	4
Melanocortin-4 receptor mutations are a frequent and heterogeneous cause of morbid obesity. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Agouti-Related Protein Child Cohort Studies Eating Female Frameshift Mutation Genetic Testing Heterozygote Humans Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Male Middle Aged Mutation Mutation, Missense Obesity, Morbid Pedigree Penetrance Proteins Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 Receptors, Corticotropin alpha-MSH || By integrating an agonist satiety signal, provided by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and an antagonist signal, provided by agouti-related protein (AGRP), the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) is a key element in the hypothalamic control of food intake. Inactivation of the gene encoding this G protein-coupled receptor causes obesity in mice. In humans, frameshift mutations in MC4-R cause an early-onset dominant form of obesity in two families. In this study we find a high frequency (4%) of rare heterozygous MC4-R mutations in a large population of morbidly obese patients. No such mutations were found in controls. By analyzing the phenotypes of the probands carrying these mutations, we demonstrate that these patients display a common, nonsyndromic form of obesity. Interestingly, functional analysis of the mutant receptors indicates that obesity-associated defects in MC4-R range from loss of function to constitutive activation. Transmission of these mutations in the families of the carriers indicates a variable expressivity that is not related to the functional severity of the mutations. This variable expressivity of MC4-R-associated obesity is not due to variations in genes for alpha-MSH or AGRP. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MC4-R mutations are a frequent but heterogeneous genetic cause of morbid obesity.	4 0
Glucokinase diabetes in 103 families from a country-based study in the Czech Republic: geographically restricted distribution of two prevalent GCK mutations. || Adolescent Child Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Czech Republic Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Glucokinase Humans Mutation Prevalence Protein Denaturation Young Adult || Glucokinase diabetes, also called GCK-MODY or maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (MODY2), is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase (GCK). The aim of study was to investigate the current prevalence of GCK mutations in a large cohort of Czech patients with typical clinical appearance of GCK-MODY. In addition, we reanalyzed the negative results obtained previously by screening using the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC). We studied 140 unrelated Czech probands with clinical picture of GCK-MODY who were referred to our center from the whole of the Czech Republic between the years 1999-2009 by direct sequencing of GCK gene. A mutation in GCK was identified in 103 of 140 probands (74%). We identified 46 different GCK mutations of which 13 were novel. Several mutations were detected in multiple families: p.Glu40Lys (20 families), p.Gly318Arg (12), p.Leu315His (7) and p.Val33Ala (six families). Direct sequencing detected a GCK mutations in 9 of 20 previously dHPLC-negative samples; the sensitivity of the dHPLC screening was calculated as 84%. The study shows a relatively high proportion of GCK mutations among individuals with GCK-like phenotype, confirming the effectiveness of carefully applied clinical criteria prior to genetic testing. In the Czech MODY registry, GCK-MODY represents the biggest subgroup of MODY (35%). We report several prevalent GCK mutations with a likely founder effect in the Czech population. Furthermore, our results provide ground for a possible recommendation to reinspect all negative results previously obtained by screening using dHPLC.	4
Targeted next-generation sequencing reveals novel USH2A mutations associated with diverse disease phenotypes: implications for clinical and molecular diagnosis. || Adult Amino Acid Sequence Asian Continental Ancestry Group DNA Mutational Analysis Extracellular Matrix Proteins Female High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing Humans Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Mutation, Missense Pedigree Phenotype Sequence Alignment Usher Syndromes Young Adult || USH2A mutations have been implicated in the disease etiology of several inherited diseases, including Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2), nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and nonsyndromic deafness. The complex genetic and phenotypic spectrums relevant to USH2A defects make it difficult to manage patients with such mutations. In the present study, we aim to determine the genetic etiology and to characterize the correlated clinical phenotypes for three Chinese pedigrees with nonsyndromic RP, one with RP sine pigmento (RPSP), and one with USH2. Family histories and clinical details for all included patients were reviewed. Ophthalmic examinations included best corrected visual acuities, visual field measurements, funduscopy, and electroretinography. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was applied using two sequence capture arrays to reveal the disease causative mutations for each family. Genotype-phenotype correlations were also annotated. Seven USH2A mutations, including four missense substitutions (p.P2762A, p.G3320C, p.R3719H, and p.G4763R), two splice site variants (c.8223+1G>A and c.8559-2T>C), and a nonsense mutation (p.Y3745*), were identified as disease causative in the five investigated families, of which three reported to have consanguineous marriage. Among all seven mutations, six were novel, and one was recurrent. Two homozygous missense mutations (p.P2762A and p.G3320C) were found in one individual family suggesting a potential double hit effect. Significant phenotypic divergences were revealed among the five families. Three families of the five families were affected with early, moderated, or late onset RP, one with RPSP, and the other one with USH2. Our study expands the genotypic and phenotypic variability relevant to USH2A mutations, which would help with a clear insight into the complex genetic and phenotypic spectrums relevant to USH2A defects, and is complementary for a better management of patients with such mutations. We have also demonstrated that a targeted NGS approach is a valuable tool for the genetic diagnosis of USH2 and RP.	1
A cross-sectional single-centre study on the spectrum of Pompe disease, German patients: molecular analysis of the GAA gene, manifestation and genotype-phenotype correlations. || Adolescent Adult Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cross-Sectional Studies Enzyme Replacement Therapy Female Genetic Association Studies Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germany Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant, Newborn Male Middle Aged Muscle, Skeletal Mutation Young Adult alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease type II, GSD II, acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency, acid maltase deficiency, OMIM # 232300) is an autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disorder due to a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA, acid maltase, EC 3.2.1.20, Swiss-Prot P10253). Clinical manifestations are dominated by progressive weakness of skeletal muscle throughout the clinical spectrum. In addition, the classic infantile form is characterised by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In a cross-sectional single-centre study we clinically assessed 3 patients with classic infantile Pompe disease and 39 patients with non-classic presentations, measured their acid alpha-glucosidase activities and analysed their GAA genes. Classic infantile patients had nearly absent residual enzyme activities and a typical clinical course with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy until the beginning of therapy. The disease manifestations in non-classic patients were heterogeneous. There was a broad variability in the decline of locomotive and respiratory function. The age of onset ranged from birth to late adulthood and correlated with enzyme activities. Molecular analysis revealed as many as 33 different mutations, 14 of which are novel. All classic infantile patients had two severe mutations. The most common mutation in the non-classic group was c.-32-13T>G. It was associated with a milder course in this subgroup. Disease manifestation strongly correlates with the nature of the GAA mutations, while the variable progression in non-classic Pompe disease is likely to be explained by yet unknown modifying factors. This study provides the first comprehensive dataset on the clinical course and the mutational spectrum of Pompe disease in Germany.	3 1 4 0
Identification of four novel connexin 26 mutations in non-syndromic deaf patients: genotype-phenotype analysis in moderate cases. || Alleles Amino Acid Sequence Audiometry Connexin 26 Connexin 30 Connexins DNA Mutational Analysis Deafness Gene Deletion Genetic Association Studies Humans Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutation || This paper presents a mutation as well as a genotype-phenotype analysis of the GJB2 and GJB6 genes in 476 samples from non-syndromic unrelated Argentinean deaf patients (104 familial and 372 sporadic cases). Most of them were of prelingual onset (82 %) and 27 % were cochlear implanted. Variation of sequences was detected in 171 of the 474 patients (36 %). Overall, 43 different sequence variations were identified in GJB2 and GJB6. Four of them are reported for the first time in GJB2: c.233dupG, p.Ala78Ser, p.Val190Asp and p.Cys211Tyr. Mutations in GJB6 were detected in 3 % of patients [nine del(GJB6-D13S1830) and three del(GJB6-D13S1854)]. Of the 43 different variations identified in GJB2, 6 were polymorphisms and of the others, 10 (27 %) were truncating and 27 (73 %) were nontruncating. Patients with two truncating mutations had significantly worse hearing impairment than all other groups. Moderate phenotypes were observed in a group of patients carrying biallelic mutations (23 %). This work shows the high prevalence of GJB2 mutations in the Argentinean population and presents an analysis of moderate phenotypes in our cohort.	1
Melanocortin-4 receptor gene mutations in a Dutch cohort of obese children. || Adolescent Child Female Gene Frequency Heterozygote Humans Male Mutation Netherlands Obesity, Morbid Promoter Regions, Genetic Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 4 || The most common monogenic form of obesity is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). We have screened the MC4R coding sequence in 291 patients of a Dutch outpatient pediatric obesity clinic. We analyzed the minimal promoter region of the gene in a random subgroup of 217 children. Our aims were (i) to determine the frequency of MC4R mutations in a cohort of Dutch clinically obese children and (ii) to search for mutations in the promoter of the gene. Eleven MC4R coding variants were detected. Five children had mutations that have been shown to affect receptor function by other research groups (p.Y35X, p.I251fs, p.G231S). These children did not have earlier onset of obesity or higher BMI-SDS than the remainder of the cohort. One child had a novel nonsynonymous coding mutation (p.L304F). This variant showed a markedly decreased cell surface expression in in vitro experiments and is thus expected to be pathogenic. We detected 12 variants in the MC4R flanking regions. Five of these were not previously described (c.-1101C>T, c.-705A>T, c.-461A>G, c.-312T>C, c.-213A>G). We investigated these mutations by family studies and a bioinformatic approach. We conclude that rare heterozygous mutations in the coding sequence of MC4R account for some severe obesity cases in the Dutch population. These patients are difficult to recognize in a clinical setting. We generated a list of all MC4R variants that were described in the literature so far, which can aid the interpretation of mutations found in a diagnostic setting.	4 0
Kinase-activating and kinase-impaired cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome alleles have activity during zebrafish development and are sensitive to small molecule inhibitors. || Alleles Animals Disease Models, Animal Enzyme Activation Genetic Diseases, Inborn Humans MAP Kinase Signaling System Male Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf Small Molecule Libraries Zebrafish || The Ras/MAPK pathway is critical for human development and plays a central role in the formation and progression of most cancers. Children born with germ-line mutations in BRAF, MEK1 or MEK2 develop cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, skin and hair abnormalities and mental retardation. CFC syndrome mutations in BRAF promote both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired variants. CFC syndrome has a progressive phenotype, and the availability of clinically active inhibitors of the MAPK pathway prompts the important question as to whether such inhibitors might be therapeutically effective in the treatment of CFC syndrome. To study the developmental effects of CFC mutant alleles in vivo, we have expressed a panel of 28 BRAF and MEK alleles in zebrafish embryos to assess the function of human disease alleles and available chemical inhibitors of this pathway. We find that both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired CFC mutant alleles promote the equivalent developmental outcome when expressed during early development and that treatment of CFC-zebrafish embryos with inhibitors of the FGF-MAPK pathway can restore normal early development. Importantly, we find a developmental window in which treatment with a MEK inhibitor can restore the normal early development of the embryo, without the additional, unwanted developmental effects of the drug.	0
An Atypical HNF4A Mutation Which Does Not Conform to the Classic Presentation of HNF4A-MODY. ||  || To present the case of an atypical Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 Alpha (HNF4A) mutation that is not consistent with the classically published presentation ofHNF4A-Mature Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY). Clinical presentation and literature review. A 43-year-old nonobese man was referred to the endocrinology clinic for evaluation of elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) measurements. Laboratory review revealed prediabetes and hypertriglyceridemia for the previous decade. Testing of autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes was negative. Genetic testing showed an autosomal dominant, heterozygous missense mutation (c.991C>T; p.Arg331Cys) in the HNF4A gene, which is correlated withHNF4A-MODY. Phenotypically, patients with anHNF4A-MODY tend to have early-onset diabetes, microvascular complications, low triglyceride levels, increased birth weight, fetal macrosomia, and less commonly neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The patient did not demonstrate any of these features but instead presented with late-onset diabetes, an elevated triglyceride level, and a normal birth weight. Our patient likely represents an atypical variant of HNF4A-MODY with a milder clinical presentation. Patients with atypical, less-severe presentations ofHNF4A-MODY may be largely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, but identification is important due to implications for treatment, pregnancy, and screening of family members.	4
Young woman with recurrent ischemic strokes diagnosed as Fabry disease: lessons learned from a case report. || Adult Brain Ischemia Enzyme Replacement Therapy Fabry Disease Female Humans Isoenzymes Kidney Function Tests Paresis Recurrence Stroke Thrombolytic Therapy Tomography, X-Ray Computed alpha-Galactosidase || Several epidemiologic studies suggest that Fabry disease should be considered in young patients with cryptogenic stroke. We report a case of a young woman presenting with recurrent ischemic strokes who was finally diagnosed with Fabry disease after impaired kidney function had been identified. Fabry disease should be considered in unexplained cases of first or recurrent strokes in young patients disregarding the gender of the patient, especially when chronic kidney disease and/or proteinuria are present. Renal function should be closely monitored in patients with strokes and followed up after the event. In this case, intravenous thrombolysis was performed after the second ischemic event. No other case of thrombolysis for ischemic stroke in Fabry disease has been described in the literature.	3 4
CDH1 germline mutations and the hereditary diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer syndrome: a multicentre study. || Adult Antigens, CD Breast Neoplasms Cadherins Case-Control Studies Female Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ-Line Mutation Humans Stomach Neoplasms Syndrome || CDH1 predisposes primarily to diffuse gastric cancer (DGC). Multiple DGC cases in a family, DGC at a young age in an individual or the combination of DGC andlobular breast cancer (LBC) in an individual or a family define the hereditary DGC syndrome (HDGC), and testing for germline CDH1 mutations is warranted in HDGC. We report all index cases from Ile-de-France in which a germline CDH1 mutation has been identified. Out of 18 cases, 7 do not fulfil the HDGC-defining criteria. Three of them are women who presented initially with bilateral LBC below age 50, without personal or family history of DGC, and who subsequently developed symptomatic DGC. Our series of CDH1 mutation carriers is the largest to date and demonstrates that LBC might be the first manifestation of HDGC. A personal or family history of multiple LBCs at a young age, even without DGC, should prompt CDH1 mutation screening. It is paramount to identify mutation carriers early, so that they can benefit from prophylactic gastrectomy before they develop symptomatic, highly lethal DGC. We recommend a revision of the HDGC-defining criteria and propose for consideration the name 'Hereditary Diffuse Gastric and Lobular Breast Cancer' instead of HDGC.	3 4
A young woman with bilateral breast cancer: identifying a genetic cause and implications for management. || Adult Biopsy, Large-Core Needle Breast Neoplasms Female Genes, BRCA1 Genes, BRCA2 Genes, p53 Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Mammography Mastectomy, Modified Radical Neoplasm Staging Risk Factors || Breast cancer is a common manifestation of an underlying genetic susceptibility to cancer, and 5% to 10% of all breast cancers are associated with a germline mutation in a known risk allele. Detection of mutations has implications for targeted screening and prevention strategies for probands, and for genetic counseling and testing of their family members. This report presents a case involving a 35-year-old woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer who presented with a palpable right breast lump. Imaging revealed multiple bilateral breast masses and right axillary adenopathy, and core needle biopsies showed invasive ductal carcinoma in both the right and left breast. This report discusses the appropriate genetics evaluation for a patient with bilateral breast cancer at a young age, including testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, followed, if negative, by consideration of testing for mutations in TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Given the specialized counseling and testing needs of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and the implications for targeted screening strategies if a mutation is found, referral to a cancer genetics expert is strongly recommended.	4
LOPED study: looking for an early diagnosis in a late-onset Pompe disease high-risk population. || Adult Age of Onset Creatine Kinase Early Diagnosis Female Fluorometry Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged Muscle Weakness Muscle, Skeletal Pathology, Molecular Reproducibility of Results Risk Tandem Mass Spectrometry alpha-Glucosidases || A multicentre observational study was aimed to assess the prevalence of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in a large high-risk population, using the dried blood spot (DBS) as a main screening tool. 17 Italian neuromuscular centres were involved in the late-onset Pompe early diagnosis (LOPED) study. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age â¥5 years, (2) persistent hyperCKaemia and (3) muscle weakness at upper and/or lower limbs (limb-girdle muscle weakness, LGMW). Acid Î±-glucosidase (GAA) activity was measured separately on DBS by fluorometric as well as tandem mass spectrometry methods. A DBS retest was performed in patients resulted positive at first assay. For the final diagnosis, GAA deficiency was confirmed by a biochemical assay in skeletal muscle, whereas genotype was assessed by GAA molecular analysis. In a 14-month period, we studied 1051 cases: 30 positive samples (2.9%) were detected by first DBS screening, whereas, after retesting, 21 samples were still positive. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies finally confirmed LOPD diagnosis in 17 cases (1.6%). The median time from the onset of symptoms/signs to diagnosis was 5 years. Among those patients, 35% showed presymptomatic hyperCKaemia and 59% showed hyperCKaemia+LGMW, whereas 6% manifested with LGMW. LOPED study suggests that GAA activity should be accurately screened by DBS in all patients referring for isolated hyperCKaemia and/or LGMW. A timely diagnosis was performed in five patients with presymptomatic hyperCKaemia, but two had already manifested with relevant changes on muscle morphology and MRI. Consequently, enzyme replacement therapy was started in 14/17 patients, including the 2 patients still clinically presymptomatic but with a laboratory evidence of disease progression.	1
[Mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene of phenylketonuria patients of Kemerovskaya Oblast' and Saha Republic]. || Alleles Asian Continental Ancestry Group DNA Mutational Analysis European Continental Ancestry Group Exons Humans Introns Mutation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Polymorphism, Genetic Russia || Phenylketonuria (PKU) associated mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene were identified by direct DNA sequencing in 46 PKU patients and members of their families from Kemerovskaya Region and Saha Republic. Mutations found included both widespread known mutations (R158Q, R252W, R261Q, P281L, IVS10-11G>A, R408W, IVS12+1G>A) and several rare mutations (IVS2+5G>A, R155H, Y168H, W187R, E221_D222>Efs, A342T, Y386C, IVS11+1G>C). We observed the increase in diversity of PKU-associated alleles in the populations studied, probably due to their complex mixed ethnic structure.	3 1
Mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene identified in 95 patients with phenylketonuria using novel systems of mutation scanning and specific genotyping based upon thermal melt profiles. || Genotype Humans Infant, Newborn Neonatal Screening Nucleic Acid Denaturation Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide Transition Temperature || Phenylketonuria (PKU, MIM 261600; EC 1.14.16.1) results from mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Newborn metabolic disease screening uses blood dried on filter paper (DBS) to prospectively identify candidate newborns affected with PKU via an elevated concentration of phenylalanine. However, it is then important to confirm the specific category of PKU since classical PKU requires a stringent diet while milder categories may not require diet and a very important BH4-responsive category may be treated with the PAH cofactor 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Since there is a close genotype-phenotype correlation in PKU, determining the PAH genotype can be extremely important for therapy as well as prognosis. A simple and rapid method of accurately determining the PAH genotype would be a valuable addition to the diagnosis of PKU. Described herein is a means to identify variants in the PAH gene using high-resolution melt profiling, which compares the thermal denaturation profile of a patient sample to that of a control. Regions where the patient and control samples produce a common profile were not further evaluated, while those regions where the patient profile deviates from the control were assessed by DNA sequencing. Additionally described is a scheme utilizing redundant analysis with melt profile controls and a novel multiplex genotyping assay to triage deviation owing to known polymorphisms. Two mutations were identified in 93 of the 95 patients assessed and in the remaining two patients a single mutation was identified. Melt profiling provided 99% sensitivity to identify sequence variants in the PAH gene.	3 1

High resolution melting: improvements in the genetic diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a Portuguese cohort. || Adolescent Adult Aged Aged, 80 and over Biometry Cardiac Myosins Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Carrier Proteins Cohort Studies Computational Biology Exons Female Genetic Variation Genome, Human Humans Male Middle Aged Mutation Myosin Heavy Chains Nucleic Acid Denaturation Polymerase Chain Reaction Portugal Troponin T Young Adult || Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex myocardial disorder with a recognized genetic heterogeneity. The elevated number of genes and mutations involved in HCM limits a gene-based diagnosis that should be considered of most importance for basic research and clinical medicine. In this report, we evaluated High Resolution Melting (HRM) robustness, regarding HCM genetic testing, by means of analyzing 28 HCM-associated genes, including the most frequent 4 HCM-associated sarcomere genes, as well as 24 genes with lower reported HCM-phenotype association. We analyzed 80 Portuguese individuals with clinical phenotype of HCM allowing simultaneously a better characterization of this disease in the Portuguese population. HRM technology allowed us to identify 60 mutated alleles in 72 HCM patients: 49 missense mutations, 3 nonsense mutations, one 1-bp deletion, one 5-bp deletion, one in frame 3-bp deletion, one insertion/deletion, 3 splice mutations, one 5'UTR mutation in MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, CSRP3, MYH6 and MYL2 genes. Significantly 22 are novel gene mutations. HRM was proven to be a technique with high sensitivity and a low false positive ratio allowing a rapid, innovative and low cost genotyping of HCM. In a short return, HRM as a gene scanning technique could be a cost-effective gene-based diagnosis for an accurate HCM genetic diagnosis and hopefully providing new insights into genotype/phenotype correlations.	4
Mutations of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes in Thais with early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. || Adult Age of Onset Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 Female Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 Homeodomain Proteins Humans Male Mutation Pedigree Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases Thailand Trans-Activators Young Adult || Six known genes responsible for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) were analysed to evaluate the prevalence of their mutations in Thai patients with MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes. Fifty-one unrelated probands with early-onset type 2 diabetes, 21 of them fitted into classic MODY criteria, were analysed for nucleotide variations in promoters, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of six known MODY genes, including HNF-4alpha, GCK, HNF-1alpha, IPF-1, HNF-1beta, and NeuroD1/beta2, by the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method followed by direct DNA sequencing. Missense mutations or mutations located in regulatory region, which were absent in 130 chromosomes of non-diabetic controls, were classified as potentially pathogenic mutations. We found that mutations of the six known MODY genes account for a small proportion of classic MODY (19%) and early-onset type 2 diabetes (10%) in Thais. Five of these mutations are novel including GCK R327H, HNF-1alpha P475L, HNF-1alphaG554fsX556, NeuroD1-1972 G > A and NeuroD1 A322N. Mutations of IPF-1 and HNF-1beta were not identified in the studied probands. Mutations of the six known MODY genes may not be a major cause of MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes in Thais. Therefore, unidentified genes await discovery in a majority of Thai patients with MODY and early-onset type 2 diabetes.	3 4
Two TP53 germline mutations in a classical Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. || Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Aged Aged, 80 and over Child Child, Preschool Female Germ-Line Mutation Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Male Middle Aged Netherlands Pedigree Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 || Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a combination of tumors including sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma and leukemia. Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with LFS. We present a family with LFS in which initially a novel germline TP53 intron 5 splice site mutation was found. A second germline TP53 mutation, the exon 7 Asn235Ser (704A-->G) mutation, was detected in this family through pre-symptomatic DNA testing. This latter mutation has been reported repeatedly in the literature as a pathogenic mutation involved in LFS. We provide evidence for pathogenicity of the novel intron 5 splice site mutation, whereas this evidence is lacking for the exon 7 Asn235Ser (704A-->G) mutation. Our findings emphasize the importance of performing additional tests in case of germline sequence variants with uncertain functional effects.	2 1
An USH2A founder mutation is the major cause of Usher syndrome type 2 in Canadians of French origin and confirms common roots of Quebecois and Acadians. || DNA Mutational Analysis Extracellular Matrix Proteins Founder Effect France Haplotypes Humans Microsatellite Repeats Mutation New Brunswick Quebec Usher Syndromes || Congenital hearing loss affects approximately one child in 1000. About 10% of the deaf population have Usher syndrome (USH). In USH, hearing loss is complicated by retinal degeneration with onset in the first (USH1) or second (USH2) decade. In most populations, diagnostic testing is hampered by a multitude of mutations in nine genes. We have recently shown that in French Canadians from Quebec, USH1 largely results from a single USH1C founder mutation, c.216G>A ('Acadian allele'). The genetic basis of USH2 in Canadians of French descent, however, has remained elusive. Here, we have investigated nine USH2 families from Quebec and New Brunswick (the former Acadia) by haplotype analyses of the USH2A locus and sequencing of the three known USH2 genes. Seven USH2A mutations were identified in eight patients. One of them, c.4338_4339delCT, accounts for 10 out of 18 disease alleles (55.6%). This mutation has previously been reported in an Acadian USH2 family, and it was found in homozygous state in the three Acadians of our sample. As in the case of c.216G>A (USH1C), a common haplotype is associated with c.4338_4339delCT. With a limited number of molecular tests, it will now be possible in these populations to estimate whether children with congenital hearing impairment of different degrees will develop retinal disease - with important clinical and therapeutic implications. USH2 is the second example that reveals a significant genetic overlap between Quebecois and Acadians: in contrast to current understanding, other genetic disorders present in both populations are likely based on common founder mutations as well.	3 1

A de novo 13 nt deletion, a newly identified C647W missense mutation and a deletion of exon 18 in infantile onset glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII). || Alleles Base Sequence Cell Line DNA Mutational Analysis Exons Fatal Outcome Female Frameshift Mutation Glucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidase Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Male Molecular Sequence Data Paternity Point Mutation Polymerase Chain Reaction Sequence Deletion alpha-Glucosidases || We identified the presumably rare event of de novo mutation in an autosomal recessive disorder, glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII). GSDII results from inherited deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) and both the expressed and structural gene (designated GAA) have been isolated. The mutation was a deletion of 13 nt of coding sequence (delta nt 1456-1468) on the paternally derived allele of the proband. The delta nt 1456-1468 results in a reading frameshift and a premature termination signal upstream of the enzyme catalytic site. Paternity was confirmed by presence of two downstream, uncommon amino acid substitutions (E689K, W746C) in both proband and father and by comparison of nine short tandem repeats. The maternal allele carried a newly identified deleterious C647W missense mutation in a highly conserved area of the protein. The C647W mutation was also found in a second unrelated proband, heteroallelic with a deletion extending from IVS17 to IVS18.	1
Prognostic Relevance of Gene-Environment Interactions in Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Applying the MOGE(S) Classification. || Adult Cardiomyopathy, Dilated Female Gene-Environment Interaction Humans Male Middle Aged Prognosis Severity of Illness Index || The multifactorial pathogenesis leading to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) makes stratification difficult. The recent MOGE(S) (morphofunctional, organ involvement, genetic or familial, etiology, stage) classification addresses this issue. The purpose of this study was to investigate the applicability and prognostic relevance of the MOGE(S) classification in patients with DCM. This study used patients from the Maastricht Cardiomyopathy Registry in the Netherlands and excluded patients with ischemic, valvular, hypertensive, and congenital heart disease. All other patients underwent a complete diagnostic work-up, including genetic evaluation and endomyocardial biopsy. A total of 213 consecutive patients with DCM were included: organ involvement was demonstrated in 35 (16%) and genetic or familial DCM in 70 (33%) patients, including 16 (8%) patients with a pathogenic mutation. At least 1 cause was found in 155 (73%) patients, of whom 48 (23%) had more than 1 possible cause. Left ventricular reverse remodeling was more common in patients with nongenetic or nonfamilial DCM than in patients with genetic or familial DCM (40% vs. 25%; p = 0.04). After a median follow-up of 47 months, organ involvement and higher New York Heart Association functional class were associated with adverse outcome (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). Genetic or familial DCM per se was of no prognostic significance, but when it was accompanied by additional etiologic-environmental factors such as significant viral load, immune-mediated factors, rhythm disturbances, or toxic triggers, a worse outcome was revealed (p = 0.03). A higher presence of MOGE(S) attributes (â¥2 vs. â¤1 attributes) showed an adverse outcome (p = 0.007). The MOGE(S) classification in DCM is applicable, and each attribute or the gene-environment interaction is associated with outcome. Importantly, the presence of multiple attributes was a strong predictor of adverse outcome. Finally, adaptation of the MOGE(S) involving multiple possible etiologies is recommended.	4
Spectrum of PAH gene variants among a population of Han Chinese patients with phenylketonuria from northern China. || Asian Continental Ancestry Group Child, Preschool China DNA Copy Number Variations Exons Genetic Association Studies Genetic Variation Humans Infant Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Prenatal Diagnosis Reproducibility of Results || Phenylketonuria (PKU), which primarily results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), is one of the most common inherited inborn errors of metabolism that impairs postnatal cognitive development. The incidence of various PAH variations differs by race and ethnicity. The aim of the present study was to characterize the PAH gene variants of a Han population from Northern China. In total, 655 PKU patients and their families were recruited for this study; each proband was diagnosed both clinically and biochemically with phenylketonuria. Subjects were sequentially screened for single-base variants and exon deletions or duplications within PAH via direct Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). A spectrum of 174 distinct PAH variants was identified: 152 previously documented variants and 22 novel variants. While single-base variants were distributed throughout the 13 exons, they were particularly concentrated in exons 7 (33.3%), 11 (14.2%), 6 (13.2%), 12 (11.0%), 3 (10.4%), and 5 (4.4%). The predominant variant was p.Arg243Gln (17.7%), followed by Ex6-96A > G (8.3%), p.Val399 = (6.4%), p.Arg53His (4.7%), p.Tyr356* (4.7%), p.Arg241Cys (4.6%), p.Arg413Pro (4.6%), p.Arg111* (4.4%), and c.442-1G > A (3.4%). Notably, two patients were also identified as carrying de novo variants. The composition of PAH gene variants in this Han population from Northern China was distinct from those of other ethnic groups. As such, the construction of a PAH gene variant database for Northern China is necessary to lay a foundation for genetic-based diagnoses, prenatal diagnoses, and population screening.	3 1
An innovative strategy for the molecular diagnosis of Usher syndrome identifies causal biallelic mutations in 93% of European patients. || Alleles Comparative Genomic Hybridization Europe Exome Extracellular Matrix Proteins Genes, Modifier Genetic Testing Humans Mutation Sensitivity and Specificity Sequence Analysis, DNA Usher Syndromes || Usher syndrome (USH), the most prevalent cause of hereditary deafness-blindness, is an autosomal recessive and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Three clinical subtypes (USH1-3) are distinguishable based on the severity of the sensorineural hearing impairment, the presence or absence of vestibular dysfunction, and the age of onset of the retinitis pigmentosa. A total of 10 causal genes, 6 for USH1, 3 for USH2, and 1 for USH3, and an USH2 modifier gene, have been identified. A robust molecular diagnosis is required not only to improve genetic counseling, but also to advance gene therapy in USH patients. Here, we present an improved diagnostic strategy that is both cost- and time-effective. It relies on the sequential use of three different techniques to analyze selected genomic regions: targeted exome sequencing, comparative genome hybridization, and quantitative exon amplification. We screened a large cohort of 427 patients (139 USH1, 282 USH2, and six of undefined clinical subtype) from various European medical centers for mutations in all USH genes and the modifier gene. We identified a total of 421 different sequence variants predicted to be pathogenic, about half of which had not been previously reported. Remarkably, we detected large genomic rearrangements, most of which were novel and unique, in 9% of the patients. Thus, our strategy led to the identification of biallelic and monoallelic mutations in 92.7% and 5.8% of the USH patients, respectively. With an overall 98.5% mutation characterization rate, the diagnosis efficiency was substantially improved compared with previously reported methods.	1
Mutational processes shape the landscape of TP53 mutations in human cancer. ||  || Unlike most tumor suppressor genes, the most common genetic alterations in tumor protein p53 (TP53) are missense mutations1,2. Mutant p53 protein is often abundantly expressed in cancers and specific allelic variants exhibit dominant-negative or gain-of-function activities in experimental models3-8. To gain a systematic view of p53 function, we interrogated loss-of-function screens conducted in hundreds of human cancer cell lines and performed TP53 saturation mutagenesis screens in an isogenic pair of TP53 wild-type and null cell lines. We found that loss or dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type p53 function reliably enhanced cellular fitness. By integrating these data with the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutational signatures database9,10, we developed a statistical model that describes the TP53 mutational spectrum as a function of the baseline probability of acquiring each mutation and the fitness advantage conferred by attenuation of p53 activity. Collectively, these observations show that widely-acting and tissue-specific mutational processes combine with phenotypic selection to dictate the frequencies of recurrent TP53 mutations.	0
Mutation spectrum and phenylalanine hydroxylase RFLP/VNTR background in 44 Romanian phenylketonuric alleles. ||  || The mutation spectrum and polymorphic haplotype background in 22 Romanian families have been analysed in this study using the restriction digestion of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) regions specifically amplified or the DGGE/direct sequencing methods. Eleven PAH mutations specifically associated with six mutant haplotypes were detected. In spite of the relative heterogeneity of the molecular defects in the PAH gene, three mutations covered almost 70% of all alleles: R408W, 47.72%, 21/44; K363fsdelG 13.63%, 6/44; and P225T 6.81%, 3/44. Among these, R408W, the most frequent mutation in our population, represented 50% of all the phenylketonuric (PKU) chromosomes. Splice mutation IVS12nt1g-->a affected two PAH alleles (4.54%); the remaining seven mutations were rare, each having an effect on just one chromosome (1/44), resulting in a relative frequency of 2.27%. A high frequency was observed in our PKU samples for the relatively uncommon mutations, K363fsdelG and P225T mutation, suggesting a possible founder effect at origin. Within the investigated panel, these mutations, both very rare among other Caucasians were exclusively linked to haplotype 5.8 and 1.7, respectively. These results provide a basis for the development of a routine molecular analysis of Romanian PKU families.	3 1
Prevalence of Fabry Disease and Outcomes in Young Canadian Patients With Cryptogenic Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events. || Adult Canada Cohort Studies Fabry Disease Female Follow-Up Studies Humans Ischemic Attack, Transient Male Middle Aged Prevalence Stroke Treatment Outcome || Previous studies reported Fabry disease in 0% to 4% of young patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke (IS). We sought to determine the prevalence of Fabry and outcomes among young Canadians with cryptogenic IS or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We prospectively enrolled individuals aged 18 to 55 with IS or speech or motor TIA, and no cause identified despite predetermined investigation. Î±-galactosidase-A gene was sequenced for Fabry diagnosis. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was measured at presentation to quantify stroke severity. Modified Rankin Scale determined functional outcomes â¤7 days after presentation and 6 months later. We enrolled 365 patients with IS and 32 with TIA. Î±-galactosidase-A sequencing identified a single carrier of a genetic variant of unknown significance (p.R118C) and no well-recognized pathogenic variants. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 3.1. Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 was 70.7% at â¤7 days and 87.4% at 6 months. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation and diabetes mellitus predicted 6-month modified Rankin Scale. Thirteen patients experienced 5 recurrent IS and 9 TIA during follow-up. No patient died. Most patients (98.7%) returned home. Among previous workers, 43% had residual working limitations. In this Canadian cohort of patients with cryptogenic IS or TIA, the prevalence of Fabry was 0.3% if p.R118C variant is considered as pathogenic. This suggests that more cost-effective methods should be applied for diagnosis of Fabry rather than systematic genetic screening in this population.

Most of these novel mutations were predicted pathogenic variants. Nonsyndromic hearing loss is the most common neurosensory deafness where the majority of patients have highly diversified genetic defects. This study aimed to define the genetic profile of deafness in a Chinese population with potential to discover novel mutations. A total of 227 segregating deaf students and 200 individuals with normal hearing were enrolled. With the Sanger sequencing chemistry, direct sequencing was performed on entire coding regions of GJB2, GJB3, SLC26A4, and mtDNA m.C1494T and m.A1555G. Direct sequencing analysis revealed that 53 (23.35%) of 227 patients carried at least 1 mutant allele in GJB2, 40 (17.62%) patients in SLC26A4, 5 (2.20%) patients in mtDNA A1555G, and 1 (0.44%) patient in mtDNA C1494T mutations. Four patients carried three unclassified mutations in GJB3 genes. Overall 38 mutant variants were detected in this cohort of patients, including 8 novel mutations in SLC26A4. The eight novel variants were six missense substitutions (p.V163L, p.G222S, p.A456D, p.N457I, p.C466Y, p.F667L), one nonsense mutation (p.W472X), and one frameshift (p.Asn612IlefsÃ23).	1
Prognostic tumor sequencing panels frequently identify germ line variants associated with hereditary hematopoietic malignancies. || Adult Aged Female Gene Frequency Genetic Predisposition to Disease Germ Cells Germ-Line Mutation Hematologic Neoplasms Humans Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Male Middle Aged Prognosis Sequence Analysis, DNA Young Adult || Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based targeted gene capture panels are used to profile hematopoietic malignancies to guide prognostication and treatment decisions. Because these panels include genes associated with hereditary hematopoietic malignancies (HHMs), we hypothesized that these panels could identify pathogenic germ line variants in malignant cells, thereby identifying patients at risk for HHMs. In total, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ANKRD26,CEBPA,DDX41,ETV6,GATA2,RUNX1, orTP53 were identified in 74 (21%) of 360 patients. Germ line tissue was available for 24 patients with 25 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants with variant allele frequencies >0.4. Six (24%) of these 25 variants were of germ line origin. ThreeDDX41 variants, 2GATA2 variants, and aTP53 variant previously implicated in Li-Fraumeni syndrome were of germ line origin. No likely pathogenic/pathogenic germ line variants possessed variant allele frequencies <0.4. This study demonstrates that NGS-based prognostic panels may identify individuals at risk for HHMs despite not being designed for this purpose. Furthermore, variants known to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well as known pathogenic variants in genes such asDDX41 andGATA2 are especially likely to be of germ line origin. Thus, tumor-based panels may augment, but should not replace, comprehensive germ line-based testing and counseling.	4
Hypo-functional SLC26A4 variants associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss and enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct: genotype-phenotype correlation or coincidental polymorphisms? ||  || Hearing loss with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA) can be associated with mutations of the SLC26A4 gene encoding pendrin, a transmembrane Cl(-)/I(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger. Pendrin's critical transport substrates are thought to be I(-) in the thyroid gland and HCO(3)(-) in the inner ear. We previously reported that bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations are associated with Pendred syndromic EVA whereas one or zero mutant alleles are associated with nonsyndromic EVA. One study proposed a correlation of nonsyndromic EVA with SLC26A4 alleles encoding pendrin with residual transport activity. Here we describe the phenotypes and SLC26A4 genotypes of 47 EVA patients ascertained since our first report of 39 patients. We sought to determine the pathogenic potential of each variant in our full cohort of 86 patients. We evaluated the trafficking of 11 missense pendrin products expressed in COS-7 cells. Products that targeted to the plasma membrane were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for measurement of anion exchange activity. p.F335L, p.C565Y, p.L597S, p.M775T, and p.R776C had Cl(-)/I(-) and Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange rate constants that ranged from 13 to 93% of wild type values. p.F335L, p.L597S, p.M775T and p.R776C are typically found as mono-allelic variants in nonsyndromic EVA. The high normal control carrier rate for p.L597S indicates it is a coincidentally detected nonpathogenic variant in this context. We observed moderate differential effects of hypo-functional variants upon exchange of HCO(3)(-) versus I(-) but their magnitude does not support a causal association with nonsyndromic EVA. However, these alleles could be pathogenic in trans configuration with a mutant allele in Pendred syndrome.	1
Disease mutations in RUNX1 and RUNX2 create nonfunctional, dominant-negative, or hypomorphic alleles. || Animals Blood Cell Count Blotting, Western Cleidocranial Dysplasia Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit Core Binding Factor beta Subunit DNA DNA Primers Flow Cytometry Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Hematologic Diseases Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Mice Models, Molecular Mutation, Missense Protein Structure, Tertiary Spectrometry, Fluorescence Two-Hybrid System Techniques || Monoallelic RUNX1 mutations cause familial platelet disorder with predisposition for acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). Sporadic mono- and biallelic mutations are found at high frequencies in AML M0, in radiation-associated and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and AML, and in isolated cases of AML M2, M5a, M3 relapse, and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase. Mutations in RUNX2 cause the inherited skeletal disorder cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD). Most hematopoietic missense mutations in Runx1 involve DNA-contacting residues in the Runt domain, whereas the majority of CCD mutations in Runx2 are predicted to impair CBFbeta binding or the Runt domain structure. We introduced different classes of missense mutations into Runx1 and characterized their effects on DNA and CBFbeta binding by the Runt domain, and on Runx1 function in vivo. Mutations involving DNA-contacting residues severely inactivate Runx1 function, whereas mutations that affect CBFbeta binding but not DNA binding result in hypomorphic alleles. We conclude that hypomorphic RUNX2 alleles can cause CCD, whereas hematopoietic disease requires more severely inactivating RUNX1 mutations.	0
Molecular basis of mild hyperphenylalaninaemia in Poland. || Humans Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Poland || The major cause of the different forms of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) is mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The aim of this study was to determine the mutations responsible for mild forms of HPA and to relate different clinical phenotypes of HPA patients to their PAH genotypes. Four "mild" mutations, including the most frequent A403V and R297H mutations, occurred exclusively in mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (MHP). Mutations A104D, R243Q, R241H, and Y414C were detected in patients with mild phenylketonuria (mild PKU) only. These results may be useful in establishing a molecular differential diagnosis for PAH deficiency in Poland.	3 1
Phosphatase-defective LEOPARD syndrome mutations in PTPN11 gene have gain-of-function effects during Drosophila development. || Animals Animals, Genetically Modified Drosophila Drosophila Proteins Eye Humans LEOPARD Syndrome Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Non-Receptor Signal Transduction Wings, Animal || Missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause clinically similar but distinctive disorders, LEOPARD (LS) and Noonan (NS) syndromes. The LS is an autosomal dominant disorder with pleomorphic developmental abnormalities including lentigines, cardiac defects, short stature and deafness. Biochemical analyses indicated that LS alleles engender loss-of-function (LOF) effects, while NS mutations result in gain-of-function (GOF). These biochemical findings lead to an enigma that how PTPN11 mutations with opposite effects on function result in disorders that are so similar. To study the developmental effects of the commonest LS PTPN11 alleles (Y279C and T468M), we generated LS transgenic fruitflies using corkscrew (csw), the Drosophila orthologue of PTPN11. Ubiquitous expression of the LS csw mutant alleles resulted in ectopic wing veins and, for the Y279C allele, rough eyes with increased R7 photoreceptor numbers. These were GOF phenotypes mediated by increased RAS/MAPK signaling and requiring the LS mutant's residual phosphatase activity. Our findings provide the first evidence that LS mutant alleles have GOF developmental effects despite reduced phosphatase activity, providing a rationale for how PTPN11 mutations with GOF and LOF produce similar but distinctive syndromes.	0
Partial characterization and three-dimensional-structural localization of eight mutations in exon 7 of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene associated with phenylketonuria. ||  || The molecular basis for the metabolic defect in patients with phenylketonuria has been characterized for seven missense point mutations (R252G/Q, L255V/S, A259V/T and R270S) and a termination mutation (G272X) in an evolutionarily conserved motif of exon 7 in the catalytic domain of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) gene. The mutations were expressed in three heterologous in vitro systems. When expressed as fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein in Escherichia coli five of the mutant proteins demonstrated a defect in the normal ability of hPAH to fold and assemble as homotetramer/dimer, and they were mostly recovered as inactive aggregated forms. Only for the R252Q and L255V mutants were catalytically active tetramer and dimer recovered and for R252G some dimer, i.e. 20% (R252Q, tetramer), 44% (L255V, tetramer) and 4.4% (R252G, dimer) of the activity for the respective wild-type (wt) forms. When expressed by a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system, all the mutant enzymes were recovered as a mixture of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms with a low homospecific activity (i.e. maximum 11% of wt-hPAH for the L255V mutant). When transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (A293) cells a very low level of immunoreactive PAH protein was recovered in spite of normal PAH mRNA levels. All these mutations resulted in variant hPAH proteins which revealed a defect in oligomerization, an increased sensitivity to limited proteolysis in vitro, reduced cellular stability and a variable reduction in their catalytic activity. All these effects seem to result from structural perturbations of the monomer, and based on the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of hPAH, an explanation is provided for the impact of the mutations on the folding and oligomerization of the monomers.	0
Structural and biochemical studies on Pompe disease and a "pseudodeficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase". || Amino Acid Sequence Blotting, Western Cells, Cultured Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Molecular Sequence Data Sequence Homology, Amino Acid alpha-Glucosidases || We constructed structural models of the catalytic domain and the surrounding region of human wild-type acid alpha-glucosidase and the enzyme with amino acid substitutions by means of homology modeling, and examined whether the amino acid replacements caused structural and biochemical changes in the enzyme proteins. Missense mutations including p.R600C, p.S619R and p.R437C are predicted to cause apparent structural changes. Nonsense mutation of p.C103X terminates the translation of acid alpha-glucosidase halfway through its biosynthesis and is deduced not to allow formation of the active site pocket. The mutant proteins resulting from these missense and nonsense mutations found in patients with Pompe disease are predictably unstable and degraded quickly in cells. The structural change caused by p.G576S is predicted to be small, and cells from a subject homozygous for this amino acid substitution exhibited 15 and 11% of the normal enzyme activity levels for an artificial substrate and glycogen, respectively, and corresponding amounts of the enzyme protein on Western blotting. No accumulation of glycogen was found in organs including skeletal muscle in the subject, and thus the residual enzyme activity could protect cells from glycogen storage. On the other hand, p.E689K, which is known as a neutral polymorphism, little affected the three-dimensional structure of acid alpha-glucosidase. Structural study on a mutant acid alpha-glucosidase in silico combined with biochemical investigation is useful for understanding the molecular pathology of Pompe disease.	3 1
Mutations in PTPN11, encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome. || Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 Genetic Heterogeneity Humans Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins Models, Molecular Molecular Sequence Data Mutation, Missense Noonan Syndrome Protein Conformation Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6 Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases || Noonan syndrome (MIM 163950) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by dysmorphic facial features, proportionate short stature and heart disease (most commonly pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Webbed neck, chest deformity, cryptorchidism, mental retardation and bleeding diatheses also are frequently associated with this disease. This syndrome is relatively common, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000-2,500 live births. It has been mapped to a 5-cM region (NS1) [corrected] on chromosome 12q24.1, and genetic heterogeneity has also been documented. Here we show that missense mutations in PTPN11 (MIM 176876)-a gene encoding the nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains-cause Noonan syndrome and account for more than 50% of the cases that we examined. All PTPN11 missense mutations cluster in interacting portions of the amino N-SH2 domain and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase domains, which are involved in switching the protein between its inactive and active conformations. An energetics-based structural analysis of two N-SH2 mutants indicates that in these mutants there may be a significant shift of the equilibrium favoring the active conformation. This implies that they are gain-of-function changes and that the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome arises from excessive SHP-2 activity.	2 4
