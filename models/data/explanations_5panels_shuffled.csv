PMID 23764561: p.Phe331Ser/p.Leu358Phe identified in one patient with MHP (Phe < 600 _mol/L on a normal or low diet). "The novel p.F331S mutation was identified in compound heterozygosity with mutation p.L358F. The HumVar score for this substitution is 1, thus predicting the severe pathological effect of this mutation (Table 3) (Adzhubei et al., 2010). Variant p.L358F was identified in a recent Czech study where this was characterized in in-silico analysis as a mild mutation ( Reblova et al., 2013). This agrees with the corresponding MHP phenotype in the carrier, providing that p.F331S is a null mutation."	3

38 individuals from 2 unrelated Portugese families with HCM. 1 proband from each family was positive for I263T and the variant was absent from 200 control chromosomes (ethnicity unspecified). In family A, the variant segregated was seen with disease in 9 affected relatives (including 1 inferred carrier, I-2). 8 segregations - mak 3.10.16  In family B, 6 individuals were positive for the variant and 2 of these individuals were affected (including the proband and 1 homozygous sibling). Note that the pedigree also marks 2 deceased individuals (II-2, II-3) as both "clinically and genetically affected", however, the paper did NOT specify that these individuals carry the variant, only that they were clinically diagnosed with HCM upon autopsy. Being conservative and only counting 1 segregation for Family B - mak 3.10.16   The disease is fully penetrant in family A but results in a very mild form of disease, whereas in family B there is only 50% penetrance but a very severe form of disease including two cases of SCD. See pedigrees to the right.	4

Direct sequencing of amplified mutant exon 7 revealed a G/C to T/A transversion at the first base of codon 272, substituting a GGA glycine codon for a UGA stop codon. The exon 7 mutation is expected to result in a truncated protein. A patient who is a compound heterozygote for these two mutations (deletion of codon 364, a CTT leucine codon) has classical phenylketonuria. It is concluded that each of the two mutations leads to a profound loss of enzymatic activity.	3

This paper showed that the V138F variant, among other SLC26A4 variants was not able to reach the cell membrane and appeared to localize to distinct areas of the cytoplasm. They hypothesized that the mutants caused aberrant protein processing in either the ER or the Golgi. This study only shows mislocalization and the variant did not have an effect on iodide efflux. Therefore, there is no direct implication of the variant causing disease (other than the SLC26A4's known LOF mechanism) as this does not prove that the mislocalization causes LOF.	0

Studies were done in Chinese hamster ovary cells -- S1570L causes reduction in the functional response of the IKs current to cAMP stimulation. @@@@@ S1570L is near the C-term KCNQ1 binding site and reduces the interaction between KCNQ1 and AKAP9. Deletion of N-term and C-term domain of Yotiao, individually or together, decreases yotiao/KCNQ1 binding. Exp done in CHO cells	0
Authors demonstrated that wild-type PTEN can rescue the neuronal hypertrophy, while PTEN D252G failed to rescue this hypertrophy. A subset of these mutations lacked nuclear localization, prompting us to examine the role of nuclear PTEN in regulating neuronal growth. We found that nuclear PTEN alone is sufficient to regulate soma size. Furthermore, forced localization of the D252G into the nucleus partially restores regulation of soma size.	0

Alteration of SCN5A biophysical properties due to S1710L is consistent with a loss-of-fuction of the channel.  S1710L channel exhibited significantly faster macroscopic current decay than WT or T1620M. In addition, S1710L showed a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of fast inactivation and slower recovery from fast inactivation than in WT or T1620M. In addition to the alterations in fast inactivation most commonly observed in Brugada syndrome mutations, S1710L exhibited marked enhancement in slow inactivation and a large positive shift of activation that potentially decreases conduction velocity.	0

Direct sequence analysis of exon 11 and flanking introns in a comp. het PKU patient revealed a G>A in intron 10 (nt 546), located 11 bp upstream from the intron 10/exon 11 boundary. No other PKU mutation was found on this allele. PCR-amplified intron 10 sequences (homozygous normal and mutant) were inserted into PAH cDNA cloned into pSVL and transfected into monkey COS cells. Isolated RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, which was then sequenced. Control had the correct sequence. Mutant had a slightly longer fragment and 9 additional nt. Inserted between exon 10 and 11, proving creation of a splice acceptor site in the mutant. Also, presence of the mutant protein in the PKU patients liver was shown by Western blot. PAH activity assay showed no conversion of C-14 labeled Phe into Tyr.	0

Investigated 8 variants, including c.635TNC (p.L212P). We used an in vitro expression system in combination with liquid chromatography (LC) applied with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS) for the quantification of tyrosine (Tyr) produced from phenylalanine (Phe) to assess the residual activities.  The residual activity expressed as a percentage of the wild-type enzyme activity, was: 17.0  7.0% (p.L212P). All of the PAH variant proteins with rather low activity (p.L212P, p.R270K and p.R261P) also exhibited reduced amounts of PAH protein, compared to wild-type.	0
Two patients with two co-existent IEMs: a girl affected by classic phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) and a male patient affected with Sandhoff disease and PKU, where Sandhoff disease was suspected due to the presence of a cherry-red spot in the eyes at 6 months which is unrelated to PKU. Sequencing of candidate genes in the first patient revealed one novel and three recurrent compound heterozygous mutations of p.Ser231Pro and p.Ala300Ser in the PAH gene and p.Glu330Lys and p.Arg170Cys mutations in the BCKDHB gene.

Segregation in four families with ARRP support pathogenicity. 9 affected (either homozygous or in trans with LOF alleles) and 8 unaffected (with opportunity to inherit both alleles). Segregation in two families with either inconclusive or argues against pathogenicity of p.Cys759Phe: In one consanguineous family (S-23), two asymptomatic individuals (with clinical evaluations for hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa) were found to be homozygous for p.Cys759Phe. In the same family, two other siblings were heterozygous for p.Cys759Phe and had a clinical diagnosis of RP. Follow-up analysis of family S-23 in Pozo et al (2015) revealed the presence of a different variant in a different RP-associated gene (PDE6B: p.Arg560Cys), that segregated perfectly with the RP in the family. Segregation in the sixth family reported in Bernal et al (2003) is uninformative as only the p.Cys759Phe allele was identified in heterozygosity in the three affected offspring.The entire coding region of USH2A was sequenced in all patients harboring p.Cys759Phe.	2

By expressing a recombinant human heart sodium channel in a heterologous cell line and recording currents with the whole-cell patch clamp technique the authors report: biophysical properties of the S1710L mutant Na channels are: (1) accelerated time course of inactivation, (2) hyperpolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation curve, (3) depolarizing shift of activation curve, and (4) delayed recovery from inactivation. These biophysical properties could potentially result in a decrease of net Na currents at each cardiac cycle, and are compatible with the electrophysiological conduction disturbance clinically observed for their patient.	0

Illegitimate PAH transcripts from lymphoblast cultures of a phenylketonuria (PKU) patient heterozygous for c.1197A/T were analyzed by RT-PCR. mRNAs with an exon 11 deletion were revealed. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products indicates that virtually all PAH transcripts from the maternal allele with the c. 1197A/T substitution do not contain exon 11. PAH minigenes with or without the substitution were constructed and transfected to a human hepatoma cell line. Analysis of the transcription products by S1 nuclease mapping clearly indicated that exon 11 skipping was directly associated with the c.1197A/T substitution.	0

PAH activity analysis.  Site directed mutagenesis, transfected COS-1 cells.  Enzyme activity measured as conversion of L-[14C]phe to L-[14C]tyr.  Use both standard cDNA expression system and a new Intinic plasmid system which incorporates intronic sequences.  For this variant, residual enzyme activity was 31% in standard cDNA and 17% using Intinic system--leading the authors to propose that this variant leads to exon 9 skipping.	0

Authors independently verify KATO III (ATCC HTB-103) human gastric carcinoma cell line contains c.1008G>A and cDNA sequencing contains alternatively spliced transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTC). "To assess whether NMD is responsible for the downregulation of mutant PTC-bearing CDH1 transcripts, we used the KATO-III cell line. This diffuse gastric tumour cell line was previously reported to harbour a splice-site mutation in the CDH1 exon 7 splice donor (1008G>A), leading to the generation of alternatively spliced CDH1 transcripts containing PTCs (Oda et al., 1994). We first performed a complete characterization of CDH1 genomic sequences and RNA transcripts in the KATO-III cell line. Short tandem repeat analysis with amelogenin and 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated that the KATO-III cell line cultured for our studies exactly matched the KATO-III DNA profile provided by the American Type Culture Collection (http://www.atcc.org) (data not shown). DNA sequencing of the CDH1 exon sequences and exonintron boundaries detected the previously reported 1008G>A mutation and also demonstrated that KATO-III cells harbour a wild-type allele of CDH1 (Figure 2a). Cloning and sequencing of CDH1 cDNA identified three alternatively spliced PTC-bearing species harbouring different lengths of IVS7 (Figure 2b)."	0

in vitro prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems were used to functionally characterize five PAH missense variants (including p.S350Y). p.S350Y was classified as deleterious since it showed no specific activity in functional assay and no response to chaperone co-expression. Protein levels of the PAH variant were very low when expressed in HepG2 cells, and only p.S350Y responded to BH4 precursor overload by significant increase in PAH monomer, probably due to reduced rate of protein degradation as the result of proper protein folding.	0

Performed a luciferase promoter-reporter expression assay to determine how the -103T>C variant affects transcription of SLC26A4. Compared to controls transfected with empty vectors, wild-type FOXI1 induced a sixfold increase in luciferase activity. When the c.-103T>C variant was transfected into the SLC26A4 promoter-reported construct, FOXI1 transactivation of the luciferase reporter was completely abolished. This implied the binding side is a major transcriptional regulatory element of SLC26A4 and is required for FOXI1-induced transcriptional activation of SLC26A4.	0

This study showed that all the variants localized in the peri-nuclear Gogli region but that the p.P51S variants showed signfiicant staining within the Golgi complex similar to WT cochlin. The p.P51S variant also showed extreacellular deposition that slightly co-localized with fibronectin. They concluded that the extracellular deposits are indistinguishable form WT cochlin and yet since they cause the same histopathoglogy as the other mutants, it is likely that they are unable to interact with the ECM components. This should not be counted towards pathogenicity.	0

We reproduced a full-length wild-type protein and seven natural full-length PAH variants (p.A403V), and analyzed their biochemical and biophysical behavior. The residual activity of the mutant PAH enzyme, expressed as a percentage of wild-type enzyme activity, was 43 4% (p.A403V). Using confocal microscopy with the number and brightness technique, we studied the effect of BH4 addition directly in living human cells expressing wild-type PAH or p.A403V. Our results demonstrate that BH4 addition promotes re-establishment of the oligomerization equilibrium, thus indicating that the dimer-to-tetramer shift in pA403V plays a key role in BH4 responsiveness.	0

Three individuals among 36 hyperphenylalaninemic patients were found to be homozygous for both haplotype 38 and the E280K mutation. All three (including patient K.A.) displayed the same variant phenotype ("Mediterranean form"), characterized by intermediary values of dietary phenylalanine tolerance (approximately 500 mg/d) and a residual PAH activity (1%-3% of that in normal controls). Similarly, one patient homozygous for the mutation, when his Guthrie card was used, had a Mediterranean variant as well (dietary phenylalanine tolerance = 400-500 mg/d; plasma phenylalanine level following the loading test = 1.32 mmol/liter).	3
The variant was reported in a 14-year-old female with familial platelet disorder with hematological malignancy.	4

Norwegian Usher cohort with some segregation analysis.  The p.C759F mutation was the second most frequent change in our set of USH2 families (3 of 28). The proband of family Ush-4M carried the p.C759F allele and a new frameshift mutation (c.2135delC) in which the cytosine deletion creates a stop codon at position 712. His hearing impairment showed a moderate and progressive pattern, and RP symptoms appeared in the second decade of life (Tables 2 and 3). In family Ush-16M, the p.C759F allele was twice inherited in combination with an eight base pair (CACAGCGG) duplication between nucleotides 944 and 951 in exon 6. This frameshift mutation (c.944_951dup) creates a stop codon 23 residues downstream. The two affected brothers with a similar ocular phenotype do not share a similar auditory phenotype: whereas in case II-1, a moderate and stable hearing impairment is confirmed, case II-2 is affected by a progressive pattern of HL. The p.C759F mutation was identified in heterozygous state in family Ush 114 in which the second mutation was not found. The HL, mild and progressive, was diagnosed at the age of 30, whereas the visual impairment appeared in his teens. 3 PM3 points.	1

PMID 23932990: 338 unrelated Chinese patients with two presumably causative alterations in the Pah gene from January 2006 through December 2012 were recorded in our database. In all patients, hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) had been detected by either national screening (57.10%, 193/338) or presence of neurological deterioration at elder age (42.90%, 145/338) with a plasma phenylalanine (Phe) cut-off level of 120 _mol/L. A defect in the synthesis or recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin was excluded by analysis of urinary pterins and dihydropteridine reductase activity in erythrocytes. Patients were classified as classic PKU (Phe, more than 1200 _mol/L), moderate PKU (Phe, 900 to 1200 _mol/L), mild PKU (Phe, 600 to 900 _mol/L) and MHP who keeps their Phe levels below 600 _mol/L on a free diet.

"We demonstrated that the TTC21B gene product IFT139, an intraflagellar transport-A component, mainly localizes at the base of the primary cilium in developing podocytes from human fetal tissue and in undifferentiated cultured podocytes. In contrast, in nonciliated adult podocytes and differentiated cultured cells, IFT139 relocalized along the extended microtubule network. We further showed that knockdown of IFT139 in podocytes leads to primary cilia defects, abnormal cell migration, and cytoskeleton alterations, which can be partially rescued by p.P209L overexpression, indicating its hypomorphic effect."	0

"Calcium is known to play an important role in ligand binding to LDLR (12, 13, 34) and is known to stabilize the fold of the EGF-AB pair (16). The observation of the same calcium-dependent chemical shift for the H_2* resonance of Thr-294 for G322S and R329P as for the WT EGF-AB pair indicates the presence of a functional calcium-binding site and therefore a correctly folded EGF-A domain for all three samples (16)."	0

Actin-translocating activity revealed the similar velocity of R302H mutant to that of the wild-type, consistent with the actin-activated ATPase activity that showed little difference from the wild-type. In all of the functional assays performed in this study, the R302H mutation showed little effect on the motor activity of myosin VIIa.  Sf9 cells were infected with viruses expressing a construct of human MYO7A that harbored previously reported Ush variants. Construct contained the entire motor domain plus two IQ motifs of myosin VIIa. The Arg302His variant showed little effect on motor activity of MYO7A. Studied ATPase activity (similar to WT), rate of ADP release from actin myosin (all other mutants showed dissociation from actin in presence of ADP, actin translocating velocity was similar to WT). Furthermore, Arg302 is not conserved among members of the myosin superfamily, suggesting that Arg302 is not critical for the authentic function of myosin VIIa.

The wild-type and the mutant forms of hPAH were expressed as fusion proteins in E. coli using the maltose-binding protein as a fusion partner. The cells expressing wt-hPAH were harvested after 2 and 24 h of induction, and the mutant forms were isolated after an induction period of 2 h. After protein purification by affinity chromatography, the fusion proteins were cleaved for 5 h at 4 C by the restriction protease enterokinase using 4 units of protease/mg of fusion protein or by factor Xa. The tetrameric forms were isolated by size-exclusion chromatography. The recombinant N207D mutant tetramer revealed a decreased Vmax value as well as a decreased affinity for L-Phe and an increased affinity for the pterin cofactor relative to wt-hPAH, but it did not show any kinetic cooperativity of L-Phe binding and no activation by L-Phe preincubation. The N207D mutant form was most susceptible to degradation, because only 19% full-length protomer was recovered after 15 min.	0

diagnosis of Fabry disease in both transplanted kidneys from a 16-year-old male traffic victim. Kidney graft biopsy samples at the time of transplantation and at 3 and 12 years later showed large and constant amounts of Fabry-specific lipid deposits. The alpha-galactosidase A activity in a donor plasma sample at the time of transplantation was the same level as in classical Fabry disease males. 14 years later, this variant was found in an archived blood sample from the patient. Retrospectively, there were no indications of clinical disease. "The boys mother and the mothers three sisters, 5464 years old, had from 10 to 61% of lower normal enzyme activity levels in blood leukocytes, as commonly found in Fabry heterozygotes. His mother also had elevated plasma and urine globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) levels. However, as in her son, Fabry-related symptoms were lacking. Diagnostic kidney biopsies, performed in two of the mothers sisters, revealed completely normal findings in one and only a single cell (podocyte) with myelin figures in the other. All the sisters 11 children (9 boys and 2 girls) were healthy and asymptomatic." The maternal grandmother had negative genetic testing for this variant, and the maternal grandfather had died at an age of 91 years after a life as a healthy man.	2

This  cohort  was previously analyzed  for mutations in the thin-filament genes (troponin T, troponinI,  alpha-tropomyosin,  and  cardiac  actin). 100 African American and 100 Caucasian individuals were analyzed as controls. E894G was identified in 3 probands and was presumably absent from controls (not explicitly stated).	4
Cells transiently expressing the variant had 0.1% of normal GAA activity, the addition of hybrid cDNA increased activity to 5.3% of normal and the addition of GAA 1 cDNA increased activity to 4.6% of normal. and gel electrophoresis showed no enzyme activity	0
Haplotype analysis at the PAH locus was performed in 17 Danish families with non-PKU HPA, revealing compound heterozygosity in all individuals. Three children had inherited a G-to-A transition at codon 415 in exon 12 of the PAH gene, resulting in the substitution of asparagine for aspartate. Pterines in the urine were determined by HPLC, and dihydropteridine reductase activity in cultured fibroblasts.	3
Seen in a pt with a Lynch-related cancer and/or polyps who also harbored an MSH2 PATH, but no phenotype provided.	3

When expressed in HeLa cells, F191L showed intracellular fluorescence with patterns indicating ER retention or cytoplasmic aggregation. F191L mutant formed large aggregates with possible plasma membrane locations, but closer inspection of the images showed that the fluorescence patterns did not have appearance of gap junctions, since apposing plasma membranes did not appear close enough together to make a gap junction. Computational modeling: Phe191 side chain is buried in the 4-helix bundle and makes hydrophobic interactions with Arg75 (alpha-helix transmembrane domain 2, TM2), Leu79 (TM2) from an adjacent monomer as well as amino acids Val38 (TM1), Ala39 (TM1) and Val190 (TM4) from the same monomer. Possible effect: substitution of Leu would destabilize structure by causing formation of hydrophobic cavity.	0
