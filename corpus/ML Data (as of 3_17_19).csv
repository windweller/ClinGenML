The first case was reported in 2015 in a 11 month old female child with a reported clinical indication of Pulmonary stenosis and ASD. No parental testing was performed and the variant was reported as a VUS-possibly pathogenic. No other pathogenic variants on the remaining genes (BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, RAF1, SHOC2, SOS1) on the panel were identified.
The second case was reported in 2017 in a 1 year old female child with no reported clinical indication. Parental testing was offered but it was not received. No additional testing information is available. No other pathogenic variants on the remaining genes (BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, RAF1, SHOC2, SOS1) on the panel were identified.

Thank for your note.
I confirm that patient 73 is the son of patient 74.

To note that the father and the mother of patient 74 , phenotypically normal, are non-carrier of the PTEN T131I.

It has not been re-evaluated since 2017 as it has not been identified in a subsequent patient specimen.
The first case was reported in 2015 in a 11 month old female child with a reported clinical indication of Pulmonary stenosis and ASD. No parental testing was performed and the variant was reported as a VUS-possibly pathogenic. No other pathogenic variants on the remaining genes (BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, RAF1, SHOC2, SOS1) on the panel were identified.
The second case was reported in 2017 in a 1 year old female child with no reported clinical indication. Parental testing was offered but it was not received. No additional testing information is available. No other pathogenic variants on the remaining genes (BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, RAF1, SHOC2, SOS1) on the panel were identified.

""To assess whether NMD is responsible for the downregulation of mutant PTC-bearing CDH1 transcripts, we used the KATO-III cell line. This diffuse gastric tumour cell line was previously reported to harbour a splice-site mutation in the CDH1 exon 7 splice donor (1008G>A), leading to the generation of alternatively spliced CDH1 transcripts containing PTCs (Oda et al., 1994). We first performed a complete characterization of CDH1 genomic sequences and RNA transcripts in the KATO-III cell line. Short tandem repeat analysis with amelogenin and 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated that the KATO-III cell line cultured for our studies exactly matched the KATO-III DNA profile provided by the American Type Culture Collection (http://www.atcc.org) (data not shown). DNA sequencing of the CDH1 exon sequences and exonÐintron boundaries detected the previously reported 1008G>A mutation and also demonstrated that KATO-III cells harbour a wild-type allele of CDH1 (Figure 2a).
